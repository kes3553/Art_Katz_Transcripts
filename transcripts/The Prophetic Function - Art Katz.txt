The Prophetic Function - Art Katz

communion.

With God is the very cradle of the auspices and origin of the prophetic word that needs first to be heard before it can be spoken.

And there's everything that militates against that communion. And I'm not talking about illegitimate things, the world. I mean, the prophet is demanding going to the shopping mall. That's not his problem.

I'm talking about legitimate things, phone calls from other believers, correspondence, conversation with people who are around you, your own flesh and blood and family, your own responsibility as a husband, a father, a son.

The legitimate things are the things that threaten.

How do you walk that out? How would you formulate that as a statement?

And who wants to put up with it?

Wouldn't it be better just to be a regular guy and not have something like this jealously to maintain and to keep and to be available for all these relational things without hindrance? Don't think that you're not going to be continually reminded of that and seduced and to throw it open and be a regular guy at last. I think a verse that comes to mind or a fragment of a verse that gets at what I'm feeling for is the description of the 144,000 as virgins undefiled with women who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.

I don't think it's talking about women who are prostitutes or harlots. And I think it's saying something more than just sexual relationship.

It's talking about and abstaining from the things that are legitimate and right and that are deserved and God-given in a way that is not required of other men. Others can, you cannot, because there's a place that you have to find for this communion with God that would be threatened by these legitimate things. And those that are the elect, the 144,000, have made those painful separating choices that they might follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.

And where he goes and when he goes is not at our convenience.

You can't tie it in neatly with your mother's visit or father's day or other kinds of going out for the picnic. I want to tell you that last Saturday's picnic was for me supremely sacrificial. I would have used that time in another way.

But circumstances, the way things work, it was something to which I had to give myself. And there's that continual tension.

And when are you being selfish and invoking seemingly spiritual reasons just to enjoy your privacy? This very tension casts you upon God. You've got to seek his face because of the very deception of your own heart that you might be employing in a sacrosanct way something that you think you're jealously guarding for the Lord's use, which is really just a deceit and a cover for your own selfishness. There are two students missing from this class who left before the first class began.

They came and they left.

And we just got a letter of explanation many days after why they withdrew. And to read that letter is to read the most loftiest spiritual considerations. Everything is set in the tone of highest spirituality.

And for me, it's highest deception.

It's selfishness and fear with regard to self couched in the most flowing and florid spiritual language that the writer even believes is true of himself.

And I'm going to do everything but at grace of God to puncture that balloon.

But I'm saying all that to say this, that we can make our calling and our spirituality a guise and a cover for the worst kind of selfishness. And that even the most profound prophets are not exempt from that tension.

So we keep talking about tension, tension, tension, tension.

You know what distinguishes tension? What is the quintessence of tension?

It's pain.

And what is the unspoken axiom and premise of our civilization? The avoidance of pain and the pursuit of pleasure. So the prophet and everything that is intrinsic to his calling is continually badgered and at odds with the whole temple of the civilization in which he's living his life. What would be more mortifying to a man like that, who is jealous for God's glory, than to have employed God as the guise and cover for his own selfishness? When that recognition breaks upon his soul, that man has got to go down deep because he has the intense jealousy for God's glory and yet he's trafficking in God to disguise something that covers his own selfishness. So a real intricate and complex thing and I'm saying all that to heighten our appreciation for the calling, for the depth of it, for the complexity of it, for the weight of it, and yet it's God's election. So no man can choose it for himself who would want to, except some misguided romantic who thinks it's something lofty and celebrating. But the word of the Lord came unto me saying, before I formed thee in the womb, I don't understand that, but it's true. Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.

What a call.

Then said I, O Lord God, behold, they cannot speak for I am a child. But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child, for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee, thou shalt speak. We would not be excessive to spend the whole rest of our morning just in sifting through those three verses. I'll just say this much and I leave it for you to jump in. The election, which is the whole principle of Israel's call, despite Israel's failure and Israel's forfeiture and Israel's contradiction, is also the prophets. That the whole concept of election of a God who elects is introduced to the prophet with his own call. He himself is elect.

The election flies in the face of the world. It's totally undemocratic. It has nothing to do with qualification. It has only to do with sovereign choice.

And you know that a lot of believers have not made their peace with that? That there's something that chafes us that one would have this and the other not, that God would elect this and leave out the other, that he would condemn and judge this and raise up those who seem to be more deserving of that condemnation. I will elect whom I will elect is the very heart of I am that I am. It's God in his sovereignty and the prophet has got to learn that smack dab right from the beginning by virtue of his own election.

Here's Elijah complaining. I don't want it is really what he's saying. Moses didn't want it.

In fact, I would say that one thing that would authenticate whether a man's calling is true is the fact that he didn't want it. That he that he that everything in him cries out against it, that he would run from it and flee from it if he could. Like Jonah, the man who too quickly embraces the call is more likely to be false.

And he doesn't really understand it's not it's something more imagined than given.

But the one who who what's the give me help me with language here. Snackers at it, rides against it, wants to flee from it, is more likely to be the one more authentically called. We need to distinguish between gift and office.

The office is the ultimate thing, the full responsibility.

It is standing as very God and speaking for God with the authority of God in a troubled and final generation. What a way who wants it with it with this knowledge that you're not going to be understood, you're not going to be heard, your the word is going to be rejected and your life is going to be threatened.

Who wants it?

Which besides all of the other tensions that have already been mentioned. So the prophet complains or is trying to find a way to extricate himself.

Well I'm not qualified.

And this very thing I think is at the root of the false conception of prophetism that is now current. That there are men today being applauded not only as prophets but the prophet of the hour. The oracle who have not the office but the gift if indeed they have the gift at all and that the condition of the church is so immature and so naive that it is unable to define or to distinguish between the gift and the office. So the gift is something that the spirit exercises at his will and it can come from a man or a woman has nothing to do with their calling, their training, their preparation, or their qualification.

It's just God severely giving the gifts as he will.

It's informational, it's maybe directive and maybe a word of encouragement but the office of the prophet is altogether something else and other and before we finish this subject I'm going to distribute a letter or read it and share it with you that I sent out to 50 men who are occupied with these questions to register my concern for this very point that men are being elevated and recognized as prophets who have not that office and then at the same I just sat down at my computer and I wrote something like distinctive elements or qualifications of the prophetic office and made 12 points and we're going to discuss those points and I think the principle one is this that the prophet who is a prophet by office is an oracle. He brings the oracles of God. His statements are the statements of God's heart to his people that have to do with his purposes in an understanding of the present time in view of the things that are future and eternal and I'm not hearing that kind of word from the men who have been presently celebrated as prophets and so you say well that would be a big deal so well you know let it go you know they're so they're so they're not what you think but look they're blessing a lot of people well that may be true but the scripture says that the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone and I am jealous for that foundation and I don't want to see any other pseudo thing be substituted for that which is authentic and so the issue of what is authentically the prophetic office I believe is one of the principal questions of our generation I in fact it would be hard for me to find another issue more critical right now historically where the church is right now where Israel is right now than this very question and what a statement of the condition of the churches I've already said that it's confused and cannot distinguish between the two but the office requires authority that's why the gift of prophecy can function through a woman as well as through a man though Paul is very express about women not having authority in the church but but a woman can express through the gift of prophecy through the gift of prophecy a word of comfort and so on but the prophetic office by its very nature requires the expression of authority and that's to be granted only to men and to men who are called so there are enormous distinctions between two things that should put us on alert not to confuse the one with the other but there's also a now speaking there is a present truth there is something in the heart of God for the church and Israel in its in the present hour and in its situation which is the rama the now word but it has to have an oracular weight it would not be a substitute for the scripture nor should it be in contention but in harmony with it but to cheat the church or to rob the church of that present speaking is to leave it without a timed something given from God that is essential to our walk our conduct and our service how else we but this is an important question because I attended a seminary where they subscribe to the to the belief that prophets are no longer extent their past and apostles also and that what we have now are the apostolic scriptures we have the canon of scripture and and and the prophetic scripture and that is our prophet our prophets are the book of geron maya how would you answer that because you're going to be confronted with this you see how the dangers that are set about they will be attacking the prophetic ministry in the last days and this will be one of those profound criticisms directed against it that is no longer extent we have the prophetic scriptures that's all we need and that when preacher preaches from them the pastor that is the prophetic function being performed who would be better qualified to interpret the prophetic scriptures than a prophetic man in fact wouldn't it be a particular dimension of an of interpretation like the highlighter that would not is not to be expected from the teacher a teacher can explicate and show implications consequences and things of that kind but to bring out the visionary content of the prophetic word in scripture what more likely vessel than one who has a call comparable is operating in much the same dimension of the spirit occupied with the same with the fulfillment but the consummation of those things then then the proof the present prophetic man and i would not let's think too much to say that the neglect of the prophetic scriptures which has characterized the church to this day has been related to the want of prophetic men to open them that in fact is a process now taking place i would say he would highlight bring illumination but i think that there is a quality of dimension of revelation and light that he is especially equipped to bring and in fact in the letter that i wrote to these 50 people i said i i find it hard to fathom this novelty this newfound attraction and excitement about prophets where people go running off to hear the latest man of God's faith and power who do not display an equal interest in the prophetic scriptures and that in fact these men themselves do not display it so it's hard for me to understand that there should be a fascination for the prophetic that exempts the prophetic word so i would say that that would be another telltale thing way of distinguishing authentic prophetic calling that such a one will always bring you back to and have foundationally the word the prophetic word very much imbued in his spirit and in his proclamation whereas the so-called contemporary prophet has more to say about your subjective life your future you've got a career you don't recognize cars going to this there's some illness something of a predictive kind about you personally that's not irracula the issue of the prophet is not that kind of prediction so there is a conjunction between the corpus the the prophetic word in scripture and and the contemporary prophet and his relationship to it his ability to illuminate and and how it correlates with his entire calling and vision for the things that pertain to the end of which the prophet spoke not yet fulfilled for which he is the present agent of God and what is he doing but activating the consciousness of the church to that word so can you see the why indeed present prophets are necessary even to quicken and make alive the whole canon of prophetic scripture but there's there's yet an argument out of the new testament that makes quite clear that apostles and prophets are not extent but are present and must be until the church itself is totally perfected what would what text would that be phoenix 411 from ephesians God gave some apostles and prophets pastors of angels teachers till when the perfecting of saints the equipping the perfecting until we will all come into the fullness and stature of a perfect man even as Jesus christ in fact there's something that has really discredited the prophetic uh scriptures are men who are looking for signs of the time and datings and and predicting apocalyptic conclusions at a certain time which of course never comes to pass and so discredits the whole apocalyptic thing and the prophetic word itself that people that's the same way that we talked about the baptism of holy spirit speaking the tongues it's been so discredited by the controversy of between the fundamentalists and the pentecostals enough of it i won't even muddy myself in that and we lose profoundly in the same way the misuse of the prophetic scriptures so it takes a prophetic heart a prophetic temperament prophetic disposition to rightly appreciate and express and convey the prophetic word that's already given i think that the heart of what God has given me is summed up in ezekiel 37 the valley the message on the valley of dry bones now i would not say the word was dead i would say it was positional but it waited for events and the interpretation of those events prophetically to quicken the text and make it alive for the hearer so here's a this is a really beautiful way of showing the relationship between the prophetic text positionally there and the moment of God's choosing in which there's a revelation a life is imbued into that word and it begins to function and to perform a work in the era when the prophetic man is quickened by God in conjunction with events and the event that triggered the text coming to life for me was the intifada the outbreak of palestinian resistance to Israeli rule that when that and at the beginning it was only relatively harmless some little kids throwing stones you're thinking of all of the the things that Israel has had to face this is this is like a fly buzzing around you know and yet it has not subsided to this day in fact it's not an exaggeration to say that the final peace accord with the plo and arafat is totally the inability to have resolved the dilemma of the intifada it was a vexation of distress and expense await that Israel simply could not continue to bear but when it first broke out see there's something in the prophetic makeup that is triggered by events and it's something i guess suppose that God has formed and given like for example the wake of disaster for others yes it was interesting and tragic and however misguided they weren't to whatever degree they might have been in danger the ruthlessness that came upon them they were extirpated the bulldozers and leveled that place to the dust there's nothing that remains that could even be sifted for evidence that might in any way even contradict the government's explanation of what their place i mean this is a major event in modern times in my opinion but my opinion is not a subjective opinion it's a prophetic opinion when that happened some what should i say something was triggered in me i have a sense of foreboding a heaviness came into me that said uh-uh this is a sign of the times heed this watch this examine this this will have ramifications for all the future what they are presently exterminating as a sect because of its apocalyptic fascination and preoccupation with the end and dismisses all present government and looks upon it as Babylon will not long be the fate of those who are not a sect but have legitimate biblical apocalyptic expectation but in the eyes of governments who want to preserve their privilege place and power are threatened by anyone who does not look upon them as being the last word and as a reality that will forever be but looks for something that will displace them namely the kingdom of God to come so it's the prophet that is alerted he interprets the event and communicates that interpretation to a church that would otherwise have passed it over that's his function and that's his call so the scriptures are there positionally but they're coming alive of them as a present word to alight the church and to set in motion a conduct through the church rests upon this critical key calling maybe more significant as the description of those two last days prophets is not so much whether they're jewish or gentile but whether they are sons of oil that's the description given the zacharias sons of oil that they are anointed powerfully anointed and let that be the highest consideration and something has not to do so much with circumstance of birth as that which God gives and that is not offended against that it could be received and uh luxuriated in that the prophets of the last days will be very much like the prophets of the first days even before the advent of Israel and the establishment of a jewish identity namely those who walked with God you know and that will be more the description of the last days prophets i don't know if anybody has any light on before i formed the inner womb i knew you i myself don't and i don't know that that's pregnant to what we're talking about the fore knowledge of God about vessels chosen for his purposes the next question would necessarily be if God was that explicit in his sovereignty for jeremiah and Paul how about us us where were we known we know of him before our conception how expensive is this election how detailed i mean it's just extraordinary staggering i mean God would have to be God to be capable of it but that he desires that it does it is remarkable what difference would it make whether that's true or not for yourself whether you're just a biological accident or something foreordained and known and and required by God in the fulfillment of his purpose and will because they speak of this generation as being the one of identity crisis people don't know who they are but to know this is to have such a foundation for your life that's immovable and that the God that was that determinative and formed you according to his own design certainly must therefore have purpose and and we're on course and we're moving towards something a fulfillment that God himself has elected what if that's that's a foundation that cannot be moved you you would be saying from the onslaughts of the pressures of our age about identity who are you and and the kinds of things that disfigure and demoralize even God's people make their marriages unhappy make them unhappy with themselves we're saying Jesus said he says of Jesus in the washing of the feet i've mentioned this before knowing that he had come from the father and that he was going to the father and that the father had given him all things he rose from supper and took off his garment and grid himself with a towel and washed the feet of the disciples that knowledge somehow was related to his ability to disrobe himself so to speak to lose the external identity and to take on an identity that was humiliating and to function in it and it's like only a rich man can really drive a Volkswagen poor man has got to have a Cadillac how many poor blacks are beggar making their families beggars and living on substandard conditions because they've got to be seen behind the wheel of an enormous boat whereas the guy who's rolling in dough doesn't matter his is a self-assurance is so established this this is a interesting and critical thing oh ye of little faith why are you afraid what is every issue the knowledge of God and and what is the prophetic function as i'm going to share with you later with the communication of the knowledge of God as God his profoundest jealousy is to communicate the sense of God to God's people as he in fact really is he's he's an anguish over any distortion or a lessening of God his his spirit is immediately chafed when he hears nominal mouthings about the lord or i adore him or love him or when it's not authentic and true or the God that's being celebrated is one of one's own projection or imagining rather than God in fact he's jealous that God the sense of God be communicated and be established as he in fact is so he certainly is the God of this sovereignty is part of that one of the activities of insecure men would be to appoint themselves to be prophets or apostles in their desire for recognition and for an authority and for a title but if we have the security that we're foreknown and established according to God's design there's no need for ambition no need for choosing self-appointing you are what you are by the grace of God in front of listen Paul say what have we that he has not given and what are we that he has not made why do you boast and really doesn't need to for his own security in God it's a powerful human instinct to need the approval of men but one who is established in this truth does not this saves him from that craving for recognition that would have compromised him you could stand rejection in fact rejection is the name of the game for anything that's authentically prophetic if you know that you're approved and accepted of God and maybe in the context of false prophets to Israel one of the greatest motives for that being false prophets is wanting the approval of the nation as we mentioned before there's something about jewish approval for gentiles that is a powerful factor in those who seem to need that so this is a remarkable saving grace if it's really established in your consciousness and that God says it in the very first statement to the prophet knowing that he's going to suffer insecurity and rejection that i have formed you and i wonder if the actual history we like of jeremiah that there was ever an occasion when he did that so it's like a something not fulfilled and yet given except that that believers in every nation have since benefited by what jeremiah's left behind as his as the book of his prophecy right anything in our lord God and verse six the language doesn't really catch that anguish cry like why they would jews beat their chest our lord God it's an exclamation didn't moses complain about that that he cannot speak and that he was tongue-tied and started i'm so fond of saying that if you can perform the christianity that you're in you're out of the faith it's by necessity apostate if you can perform it if your christianity is not something beyond your ability you're out of the faith because God does not want you to be God does not call us to what we can perform that would be limiting the holy one of Israel he calls us to what can only be performed on the basis of his power so right there you know an issue is struck that it needs to be settled that the whole commencement of the prophetic call unless he had said that he would have been disqualified right so his disqualification is his qualification okay anything in verse seven God's answer to that don't say that you're not a child thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee i love that word send they always underline it when i see it because the word send is at the root of the word apostolic i forgot what the there's a hebrew word that's the equivalent of apostolic but it catches the same meaning an ambassador and serving and in the place of the one for whom he has ever been indeed so sending is critical and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak how do you like the whatsoever but would that include things that the prophet himself would not have chosen and there's not going to be any question about about it that the one that whatsoever is what you will speak whether you like it whether it agrees with you or your own taste don't think that this is a small thing to have to hear out of your own mouth words that you would not have chosen that may that are either insulting or are received by people as insult or are abrasive or guaranteed to uh grew up a storm or to be misunderstood or you don't like the taste of it you don't like the sound of it it's not the way that you would have expressed it or what you would have expressed and yet you're required to speak it but i've seen extraordinary results when you're obedient to speak the ungainly word i can give you all kinds of anecdotal things i don't want to take up too much time with it or think that in any way i am saying it to direct any attention to myself but it's the most it's the thing with which i'm most familiar in terms of prophetic function like a moment of truth that came in australia and a charismatic group that were having the most wild celebration of their having arrived and ain't we got fun and boy isn't this great and aren't we overcomers and all of that and there was a moment of time when the lord froze the scene and i saw right through the mask of the outward gaiety and celebration to see a face of insecurity and fear and drunken lips of people who were not well ordered in the world and that they were celebrating a fiction that they had come to persuade themselves by their choruses and i had a choice to make whether i was to address them in the appearance that they gave of themselves or what had flashed to me in a moment when God froze the scene and showed me their authentic condition knowing that if i addressed them in that condition there would be a contradiction and a conflict and at that very moment i was being called up to speak i opened my i took a if you ever see a man sighing when he begins he knows something heavy is required and i described the vision and i addressed them in terms of the insecurity i don't know if you know it that australia has been founded on convict labor that england opened its prisons and sent the debtor class to populate this territory and and so even sociologists and others recognize that there's been a permanent and ongoing insecurity in australian life that's why they are macho figures where men crush the beer cans and wear tattoos and their big tennis buffs and there is a heavy macho thing which comes out of this historic insecurity and which was evidently in that fellowship but the church is the ground and the pillar of truth and it could not be a witness to its own community unless it was in that condition and so the choice was allowing them to go on enjoying their charismatic delusion or blowing a whistle on it and bringing it back to a halt without giving them any alternative so i spoke the word of truth and it was for them a moment of truth and i saw the when they heard what was coming out they staggered i got i guess the visible trembling attention of what do we do with this who is this guy who i wasn't even programmed i was not even supposed to be there and do we receive or reject this because if we receive it it's the end of everything everything that we've celebrated has got to go up like a puff and we we start from ground zero and square one or we dismiss this guy and go on our celebration but we might be haunted later if he were not right well i have to say to the credit of that people they received the ungainly word as the word of truth and there was a snap crackle and pop that word was not just description that word was event and down they went they went down in repentance before the God of truth for the masquerade that had been conducted to which they had themselves come to believe and the air just changed the whole atmosphere reality came in and a prophet is jealous for reality but that's very God and like people could breathe easy they could be what they are you know and enjoy the grace of God and the acceptance of God as they really are and in that place of truth he would meet them and bring them to an overcoming place so many many occasions like that over the course of years where your your heart beats like a trip hammer you're ready to stop breathing knowing that a moment has come where obedience requires you to speak the word that God has given and no assurance of how it's going to be received so when God says to jeremiah and to us whatsoever i command you thou shall speak you know that that's enough for me that that whatsoever is so all-inclusive that at one day might not just be the issue of a moment of truth and and fright but the moment of your death that the very words out of your mouth may compel such a reaction against you like steven whose words prompted his martyrdom and so may ours and you're not allowed to be diplomatic you know even as you're speaking there's a way in which you can soften what you're saying just the change of a word or the tone or the accent we kind of take the sting out of it and that temptation is continually before you so to speak the word that you're given is not just the technical word but the tone of the word the urgency um is implied in that speaking you have to be faithful not only to the content but also to the manner and that's no small obedience and there's no room for you in your personality what you would like to have said how you would have expressed yourself it requires absolute total surrender how is the church going to come to this prophetic stature except by that same means if God's ultimate intention final intention is the church as a prophetic entity in the earth and particularly with God to Israel because it's the word of the church of the last days that will raise Israel from its grave it will be the son of man who will be commanded to prophesy it has got to come first to this total obedience and surrender and when you look at the condition and when you look at the condition of the church today so it's going to take a word from the prophetic man to the church and the receiving of that word by the authority and the anointing of that word to bring the church itself to the place that it might be that thing to the nations and to the nation is an interesting that both in verse 17 and birth verse seven what follows in both places is being not afraid of their faces yeah what does that imply why would you be afraid of their faces their face is going to be the face of anger the irritation shock how dare you by what authority who said where do you come off to say how dare what do you mean could you can you see that we just have to appreciate again the depth of our human craving for acceptance approval and recognition not just by those who will oppose us but our own people the church itself we want the approval of our own people so this is not only a provision to speak a word in a hostile environment but even in a good environment the first thing we want to hear after we finish the message is someone to come over and clap us on the back and say boy i was so blessed and you almost look for someone who'll come over to do it it's so powerful to me the approval of men so we live by faith and not by sight we don't look for and in fact if the opposite comes we don't come unglued don't come unraveled because of the horrendous thing you know when we had the outreach at Bemidji state after 10 days of fasting and it seemed like a flop three days we fasted those three days as well and had pitiful meetings that didn't seem at all significant or anyone affected and the final meeting we had knocked on every door at the dormitory and had a meeting of the student union i said to the people if you come tonight i don't care what your christian background has been you're going to see something extraordinary and i really believe that and about 50 people came up that night and it was anything but extraordinary it was so humdrum it was so matter of fact i wasn't even given a message as i shared before just different ones in the fellowship got up and shared this and that and the other and kind of just put it together and i was i was so unimpressed i had not the courage to give an invitation i said something like well if anybody has any question you know feel free to come up after we conclude and just ask any of us and they're about three or four guys as close as craig and one guy with his arms over his chest looking at me so hostile and shooting daggers at me with his eyes and who gets up when the meeting ends but this guy starts working for me this is it i'm going to catch it right in my jewish puss the guy turns to me he says i've never heard anything like this what must i do to be safe he was among the four who were baptized that night in the lake right outside the the student union building when you look at the face i would have thought this is trouble that face spells trouble and i didn't even rightly interpret the face it looked menacing when actually the guy was moved beyond those speaking so not to look at the faces is so powerful a thing and that's why God brings it up immediately these are the constituent elements of prophetic ministry introduced and spoken at the very moment of the call i am with me to deliver these say if the lord deliver deliver him from what not only from dirty looks or that is and yet the lord himself testifies to a number of prophets who were stoned to death where where was their deliverance one thing we know about steven and other martyrs was that that they did not actually feel the torment of their death there's no indication of steven feeling the impact of those thoughts he was so oblivious so-called upward to heavenly vision so concerned with God's mercy for those who are killing him it seems to be impervious to what was happening to his body and their testimonies of martyrs who pre-arranged with their fellows that when the they would be burned alive at the stake when the ropes themselves would burn and snap that they would hold their hands up as the sign of victory that they were not feeling the torment of those flames and did so so i wonder if that's got something to do with this i'm not going to deliver you from death when death serves my purposes or fulfills your term of ministry but i will deliver you from what makes death so fearful namely that anguish of body and soul that makes men cowards i'll deliver you from that seems to be the testimony of martyrs because otherwise how is that to be understood when it's clear that Jesus himself testified to the prophets that were sent to you and that killed any any other response that i would that are you confident now and here's a question can you vicariously take this text for yourself is God just speaking to jeremiah or is this a statement to every man called to bear that ministry in the one proportion or the other i will be with you i will deliver you which has got to be believed on the basis of the word spoken and not the sensation of feeling experienced you're not going to feel the presence of God in the moment of trial you're going to feel my God my God why hast thou forsaken me you're called to remember the word that has been spoken because the prophet is preeminently the man of the word and if he'll not believe and stand on the word for himself what is his credibility in giving the word to others this is critical so life and death are always the issue just for the purpose of time that's fleeting but i wanted to get in verse 10 of what this call is that to which jeremiah is calling the word that God has put in his mouth i have this day set the over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy and to throw down to build and to play if that's a quintessential definition of the prophetic call what does that tell us what is the first expression of the prophetic calling judgment pull down to destroy to root out the plug down in fact unless you have a stomach for that will you be allowed the privilege of the word that builds in advance but this is the reading of the word word for word for word and even the order of the words speaks volumes why didn't God begin with i've called you to build into plant in the course of which you'll also have to plug up and root out and and tear down and destroy why didn't God start with the positive note rather than with the negative note the hardest thing first begin at jerusalem and then to the to judia and to the the uttermost corners of the world everything that's painful to the flesh that's violent that's contrary that will earn for us the displeasure of men because what are we rooting up and pulling out things that are dear to men their religious tradition the things that they have celebrated for generations however false the things that they want to cling to because it has to do with their identity and their dignity and the way in which they even see themselves men will kill for this you've got to you've got to tear down and to destroy you've got to be painful you're a destroyer your word is destructive before it is benevolent and unless you're willing for that you'll never be used before benevolence and in fact remember what we said only the prophets who are faithful to speak the word of exile and judgment were the prophets who spoke the word of restoration and return they were faithful to speak the word of tearing up rooting up and destroying but they were given the privilege of speaking the word creative word of restoration and return what's the ratio of the destructive to the constructive in this statement twice as much the ministry of destruction as the ministry of planting why why should it at least be at a parity why is the one twice as great as the other for the profit of restoration um before the you can restore the ancient truths what first needs to be done pre-trib rapture uh the church is the Israel of God a lot of things that we've already talked about the church is shot through with such a mishmash of traditions of noxious ocean notions of heresies of things that were not known by the fathers like pre-trib pre-tribulation rapture and so on that needs to be removed before the planting can take place and and will be contended against fiercely just that pre-trib rapture has such a valence and weight that to contest it is to be considered yourself heretical as if you are seeking to read to question something sacrosanct in the church and given by God from the first when its history is less than two centuries that's the power that that thing has obtained we mustn't lose sight of the fact that the work of restoration requires first they're dealing with things that need to be taken out of the way that will be a much simpler task if we just have to establish fresh principles where it's the it's on virginal consciousness but when you first have to deal with and penetrate a whole medley of opinion and tradition that have become dear if not sacrosanct what a work what a labor what a resistance what objection what howls and shrieks what will you be accused of ironically i've been accused of being opposed to the body of christ because i took issue with a kind of false charismatic ecumenical unity at a conference of the Jesus rally in winnipeg and the first accusation was we thought you were for the body of christ you're attacking the body of christ i wasn't attacking the body of christ i was attacking a false uh what you call it unity a false unity presumed to be the body but a unity between denominations between institutions not the organism which is the body but in the ear of the hearer jealous for the institution i was attacking the body of christ
