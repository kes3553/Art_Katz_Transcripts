The Anatomy of Worship - Art Katz

that God works his models out of the living relationship with himself and that we should be careful to Watch that relationship and not be stripped of it by even activity for the Lord But the relationship is the key so in the second paragraph He writes beware of outstripping God by your very longing to do his will we run ahead of him in a thousand and one activities Consequently we get so burdened with persons or the difficulties that we do not worship God. We do not intercede but just to show you the way that I operate I take my yellow marker and I mark worship and then I take it and I mark intercede and then I put one arrow going from worship to intercede and intercede back to worship to show the remarkable Candom connection between worship and intercession there there is no intercession true intercession that does not flow out of worship and worship flows out of relationship and what he's saying is even the activity for God can steal the relationship and Rob the worship and therefore leave you without an adequate intercession If Once the burden and the pressure come upon us and we are not in the worshiping Attitude it will produce not only hardness toward God, but despair in our own souls And when I read that I thought wow That's just so much on with what has come to my attention the day before When my brother in Holland my key man in Holland To whom I had written to say are you irritated or something are you your your glass letter or so to me? Sounds very cryptic very short very terse very edgy, and he said yeah, he said I'm I'm weak and I forgot the words that he used impatient Tired weak and tired, and he felt that he was being oppressed of the enemy And he can't wait for this thing to be over with which he's involved with me.

What kind of an attitude is that?

So he thinks it's the enemy Probably in proportion to the importance of what we are about and so I said to him well You need to look to your devotional time Probably you're sagging and being affected because you're not in a worshipful relationship with the Lord and therefore you're experiencing discouragement and weakness and So this this is what Oswald Chambers is saying that if we lose that worshipful attitude it will produce hardness toward God and weakness and despair in our own souls In a certain historic way, this is exactly what happened to Germany it experienced hardness to the degree that it lost its worshipful relationship with God and Hardness is another name for cruelty What Jews experienced at German hands? Was hard it was a hardness of heart and a cruelty for that for which they were capable Because they became hard to the degree that they lost the worshipful relationship that with God that comes through relationship They lost their connection with worship and relationship that results in hardness and despair in our own souls and Despair is at the root of Nazism There's a fancy word called nihilism, which is the denial of everything it's the negation of everything It's a despair in which there's no hope for anything and you bring it down in a gother dammer rung a final damnation of everything where the German cities are left in burning rubble that was the end of World War two where Hitler was down beneath the earth in his Bunker while overhead the whole great capital city of Germany was in burning ruins You've ever seen those pictures of that city taken by air at the end of World War two Whole Year of Mile wide areas.

There's not a building with a roof on it. They're skeletons. They're just gone.

That's the walls It was a complete devastation That's the consequence of losing that relationship and Bringing hardness and heart toward others and despair in your own soul. That despair is at the root of Nazism and why they were capable of atrocity and Annihilation and the devastation of Europe and finally of Germany itself Then he says God continually introduces us to people for whom we have no affinity Unless we are worshiping God Well, the people to whom God introduced Germany for whom they had no affinity were the Jews themselves There was no natural affinity for the Jew The only thing that would enable you to relate to a people for whom you have no natural affinity is the worshipful thing That stems from that relationship with God And if you don't have it the most natural thing to do is to treat them heartlessly So I wrote in the margin history demonstrates that the natural thing that takes place That becomes heartless when it's left too long. It becomes unnatural and ultimately cruel and bestial You go from the natural Inability to have an affinity with the people who are different to a place where you it becomes unnatural and finally it becomes cruel and bestial German history proves What Oswald Chambers wrote about before the advent of Nazism and everything goes back to the loss that comes To man when he loses a worshipful relationship with God a hardness in his own heart and inability to relate to those that are different and a natural revulsion that becomes Unnatural and finally becomes bestial is the experience of modern times And that's the nation of the Reformation That's the land of Luther that lost it over a process of time And Worship is honoring God.

I looked up the word worship in a dictionary.

I'm not happy with What I read there, but it needs to be explored but Worship is the issue of honoring God whether you do it in testimony and praise and song and preaching and witness it's acknowledging God as God as the source of all and Cain and Abel is the example of a Worship that was acceptable to God and a worship that was rejected worship is sacrifice Cain's sacrifice was not acceptable to God and and the Abel's was Matthew Henry says the way that you can know it is that God consumed Abel's sacrifice by fire and left Cain's sacrifice unattended That remarkable Because one was authentic out of a worshipful heart was a worshipful sacrifice a worshipful offering that recognized God as the source of The blessings that have been received that was paying homage to the God who provided it and God found that acceptable but the word Cain means Performance production Self-sufficiency He gave only a scant nominal acknowledgement of God as a religious kind of obligation Like paying his dues and God did not consume that sacrifice It was not acceptable and the proof that his heart was wrong and that his heart was hard was that he got angry Cain became angry So angry that he finally murdered his brother whom he envied because God favored him and Accepted his sacrifice while he spurned his own The fact that he could be angry both against God and against his brother unto murder shows that he had not a worshipful heart to begin with and He could not relate To someone who was different God continually introduces us to people to whom we have no affinity and unless we are worshiping God The most natural thing is to do is to treat them heartlessly That's what Cain did to his own brother He treated him heartlessly. It was the first murder And it's related to a failed worship that is related to a failed relationship That was not worshipful. See how Remarkable all this stuff Remarkable all this is God was not honored because he was no longer seen as the source of German prosperity But industry commerce state and education the work of their own hands Cain means acquisition getting production Possession and Abel's name means futility and vanity interesting one emphasizes human attainment and the other name means non-attainment It's weakness.

It's foolishness.

It's saying without God I can do nothing If there's any increase it's come from God and I honor him because I recognize he is the source Germany lost connection with the source because it was prospering by its own hand Its own industry its own military its own system of education They lost the relationship with God.

They lost a worshipful relationship.

They became hardened in their heart They could not relate to those that were different the Jews in their midst They became unnatural and finally they became cruel and they became bestial That's exactly what came became to his own brother Abel and at the end of the age How does God separate the sheep from the goats the Cain people from the Abel people?

How do you relate to your brother?

When did we see you naked thirsty hungry if you have not done this for the least of my brethren who should be your brethren You've not done it unto me and therefore be sent into the fire prepared for the devil for his angels They are the people of Cain Not to be able to relate to your brother There's the whole issue of the relationship to God In the last days they cannot even recognize the Jew as their brothers let alone Be gracious to them even in a natural way The issue of the brother Recognizing the brother and being merciful and gracious rather than hard and unkind is the issue of the relationship to God That's why he can tell at the end of the age who's with me who's against me who's Cain who's Abel who goes into the fire?

Who goes into the kingdom?

prepared for for sons This Gierhard von Rath the German scholar says responsibility before God is responsibility for one's brother Remember what Cain's after he had murdered his brother the Lord said to him.

Where's your brother?

He said to Adam where are you but the Cain says where's your brother? He says am I my brother's keeper and The answer really is exactly You're the older brother you're the firstborn you should have been watching over him You should have been protecting him not murdering him the issue of your brother Your will your attitude and relationship to your brother is the whole issue of God Responsibility before God is responsibility for one's brother That remarkable Killing a brother That's That's the way the age begins and and Seth Replaces Abel and from the time of Seth and Seth's children People begin to acknowledge the name of the Lord. It begins real divine history and Then they then the Bible gives the genealogy and Cain is completely omitted There's no reference to Cain the spiritual history begins with Seth who replaces him. It's interesting that when Cain is born Eve says I have produced a man When Seth is born she says God has appointed Seth means appointed Cain I have produced Cain means produced getting acquisition power She said I have produced the son with the help of God which is just a little crumb, you know for God It's a religious piety But I have produced but when Seth came she says God has appointed For me another child instead of Abel because Cain killed him So to Seth also a son was born in his name named in Enosh And at that time people began to invoke the name of the Lord spiritual history begins with the replacement for Abel and I don't know if I'm being very fanciful here But if you see this as a parable or a kind of a design Abel died at the hand of a murderer in order to make way for a Seth with whom the real spiritual history begins and at which time the people begin to acknowledge the name of the Lord So you can almost say that Abel is a picture of present Israel that needs to be brought to death in order that it might be replaced by a Seth who is appointed and who will bless all the nations who will call on the name of the Lord that that though Cain is the instrument of the devil and Is heartless Toward his own brother and is capable of murder something like the apostate church today something like the apostate God rejecting world will be the instrument of bringing down present Israel unto death And God will replace that with with the nation that's appointed By which nations will begin to call upon the name of the Lord So the Lord's design is fulfilled even through the death of one brings the birth of another But I just encourage you to look at this first murder it's a remarkable Statement and it has it goes back to the issue of worship Worship is offering worship a sacrifice one acceptable and blessed Received by the Lord and the other rejected because the other was nominal religious cursory an obligation something convenient Something convenient Because Cain gave from the fruit of the field. He was a farmer He gave what was accessible Abel took the best of the firstlings of the flock He gave the best of the flock and he gave the fat of the first thing Fat may be to us Repulsive but to God fat is the accumulation that comes from rest So you mean Fat is a statement of a devotional Dependency and rest upon God and that he found that acceptable his fire consumed it Cain's was a sacrifice of convenience that was at hand that he could give but it cost him nothing It was not a real honoring or an acknowledgement that the source of his prosperity had come from God Because Cain was a tiller of the ground He labored He was a possessor And Matthew Henry says That probably these two sons these two first sons had a choice in their vocation One chose to be the tiller of the earth and produce because that's what he was While the other chose to be pastoral And to watch over the flock Because that is a devotional occupation There you sit with the flock and you have much time to reflect on reality and truth in God and Develop a relationship that could become worshipful Isn't that a remarkable insight and it was a choice Abel chose to be a pastor Abel chose to be a shepherd And he recognized that the increase came from God and he gave him the homage do him as true worship Isn't that a beautiful story?

What these sons represent and the conflict between them? eventuating in murder And the attitude of Cain when he's confronted by God with the question. Where is your brother? Am I supposed to know? What am I my brother's keeper?

the insolence of that The audacity to talk to God like that shows that it's a man who never had a worshipful Or even a respectful attitude toward God that when he's confronted with his sin He lashes out with a lie.

I don't know. What am I my brother's keeper?

So he's a liar and a murderer like his father And the lord had pleaded with him, you know sin is at the door Yes, your offering has been rejected But if you'll do right And sin will not consume you it's at the door waiting to act out what you have already set in motion If you don't watch it What you've done in this nominal relationship with me that hardens your heart will turn to your brother as murder And the very next thing we read is Cain took Abel out into the field and murdered him After God's warning of what would happen unless you amend and change your ways He still remained angry What what a picture this is And and induces his brother to come out in the field that he might murder him How did he induce him? He probably lied to him or flattered him or gave him a false encouragement in order to do him in On the heels of God's warning that sin is at the door and it will capture you It's wanting God's acknowledgement and acceptance on its own terms On what it produces And fails to see the grace of God in the field as well as in the fork Because God calls us to worshipful service We remembered uh, was it yesterday morning? Romans 12 one says make of your body a living sacrifice, which is your appropriate worship or your appropriate service unto the lord Everything should be worshipful Whatever the sacrifice whatever the The labor whatever the activity And should come out of a relationship as unto the lord And that's something that Cain failed to obtain and it's the danger. It's the thing that befell Germany They produced also out of themselves The leading economy and military power of central europe and it almost brought down civilization And it hardened their heart it made them angry it made them unnatural Everything goes back to true worship that God is waiting for and true worship waits on relationship. So So I'm just appreciating what the lord is opening in this Cain was the firstborn And yet God's favorite That should have been with the firstborn who inherits everything according to the biblical mode rested on the secondborn it's something like uh jacob and esau Again, esau was the firstborn but God's favor does did not follow the propriety or the uh, Mechanics of men he chose what he would choose So the attitude of the older brother toward the younger even like the prodigal son and the older brother showed a resentment and an envy and an anger in each case And the inability to recognize the grace of God on the other brother Because your relationship with your brother Is relative to your relationship with the father If you have not an adequate and right relationship with the father that's worshipful.

How shall you recognize the brother?

So therefore the brother is the litmus test Of your relationship with the father and that's why when did we see you naked thirsty and hungry?

When did we see you in the least of these brethren?

We didn't see you as the father we didn't and therefore How could we recognize the brother though?

They said lord lord.

I've never known you and Be cast therefore into the fire prepared for the devil for his angels the sheep and the goats the cain People and the able people are the two categories that remain at the end of the age and it's the issue of Israel That identifies them There'll be no no other category We're moving toward one or the other So this issue of worship is so enormously important and we've been turned off from it Because it has become a commercialized thing. It's become a production worship teams worship leaders Of music amplifiers or as if music is worship it can aid worship But it is not in in itself worship worship is an attitude Worship is a relationship worship is an honoring worship is an acknowledgement And that's what he's talking about you lose that you're going to get tired defeated despairing and hard To Germany is the national statement and my brother in holland is a personal statement But it's a threat to all of us so that's why when we We had these these little pregnant sons. I said, you know, this is an opportunity to give a testimony That's worshipful the singer chorus. That's worshipful to share the word of the lord. That's worshipful it's not music only but Worshipful things are acceptable to God that flows out of a worshipful heart. That's in a worshipful relationship You shouldn't have to be prompted to give a word of testimony to the lord.

See what I mean?

If you're in a worshipful abel place See Abel chose to be a shepherd He chose a vocation that would give him opportunity for devotion Because you see you you're with the flock But what do you do you're sitting like david and you're playing your lyre and you're composing your worshipful courses in your songs I chose to be a teacher Not for the least of reasons that it would give me occasion to read I wanted to be a teacher because I knew it would require reading and study so I chose a vocation That would implement my desire And that's what matthew henry is suggesting. It's it's It's just a conjecture But he's saying that these two brothers see this is the beginning and these brothers are prototypes One chooses this one chooses that one has this kind of disposition toward God. The other has another one You know, I think of that phrase that their souls were made lean When you have a lean soul, there's no fat you know Fat has taken on such a pejorative Meaning in our generation we want to get rid of it. We die it but i'm trying to Communicate it in the biblical old testament sense of why When when God smelled the sacrifice of the fat that was for him the sweet aroma Because it was a statement of a spiritual kind it was a symbolic kind But if you give a sacrifice without fat, it means you're giving the most rudimentary Thing that is more the product of your sweat than the product of your devotion Abel gave what was the product of his devotion you see the meaning he was a medit a meditator Isaac was a man of the tent. Jacob was a man of the tent That's a picture of a pastoral life that finds time Not to be so busy that it cannot seek and communicate with God In our natural bodily life We don't want to accumulate fat. It's not healthy And it shows improper diet lack of exercise lack of discipline But spiritually speaking we want to accumulate it We want spiritual fat that comes from waiting on the lord devotionally You know what I mean to reckon to see the the difference between the natural meaning of the spiritual meaning But isn't it interesting that the egyptians despised the Israelite Occupation of being sheep herders It was the lowest form of employment from the egyptian perspective to be A watcher over a flock was in in the sight of egyptians the lowest Of all occupation and maybe later on in Israel That when God chooses a king of all of the sons of jesse, he takes the one who's the shepherd Because the shepherd is the is the devotional one or has at least the potential and the opportunity for devotion You know the story of when we lived in Israel and I in carmel In the galilee heights I got up in the morning. I wanted to go up and find the time with God and I had to go through brush with thorns and thickets and Climbing my way up my legs were just bloody But I finally found the rock and the sun was just coming up over the horizon And i'm wanting to wait upon the lord and to be before him in this understrike And as the sun came up and the heat came up with it the first thing I saw were the droppings of the sheep All around that area that's where the shepherds had taken their flock And because of the droppings there were the flies And because of the flies I was beginning to get nipped And I I got my legs were getting like swollen places I finally had to leave and my little bubble was burst of the idyllic Devotional time that I thought I would have alone up on the mountaintop So it gave me another perspective it said that David followed after the sheep he had to walk through their droppings And fight off the flies the thickets this devotional life is not a snap This is not some little sugar candy thing. That's why God respects it It's a God honoring thing because it requires persistence because it's not ease It requires a heart that's willing To find the time and to keep persistently at it before God because you recognize him as your source He's your he's the blessing It's the lord who gave out of the proverbs a statement for the black community in america And gave the occasion to speak it and the fire of God came down that day on that sacrifice He consumed it the people were beside themselves with with applause and with Excuse me But the because I knew and he knew that I knew that he was the giver of every good and perfect thing That comes down from above My attitude was an able attitude not a cain attitude. It wasn't something I produced It was something given out of a devotional relationship and the fire of God fell on it The same thing happened in nuremberg, germany with that message on true and false I Repentance toward the jew May there be more fire falling on what God Honors because he knows it's born out of sacrifice and out of relationship with himself so let's Let's just pray along those lines and the thoughts of the lord for us Of course righteousness is is the impartation of what God himself is And impartation takes place in relationship in union and union in relationship Abel evidently found time for it And his prime time if he gave his chief Sacrifice the first thing of his flock and the best of it It was a statement of what had been characteristic of him all the time His first thought is always God his first giving is always God That's worship worship is the acknowledgement of God as God first And then you give the first see what I mean you give the best Not just what is convenient for you Brother is the litmus test of what the truth is of our relationship And we're going to say to germany that the jew in your midst for 2 000 years was your brother What? These this people they're so different the strength and side curls they they were black there They're not like us we're germans.

We're civilized.

We're blah blah They failed to recognize their brother Because they were different They were the least of his brethren they could not recognize them as brothers They could not extend themselves to the brother that the jew was to the german and killed him They could not save him so they killed him They could not beat to to the jew in the midst the older brother and show them the way show the the younger the way of the lord And and what you cannot save you ultimately destroy What you cannot relate to naturally becomes unnatural I'm going to I may be speaking this in germany Lord give me grace Lord give me grace Because one of the things that we're already learning is some reaction already from the german edition of holocaust book We're we're a wounded people How did how did this woman say it? About germany we're wounded and We lack a national self-esteem it's interesting that when God gives cain his judgment He doesn't kill him He makes him a wanderer Over the face of the earth and he says this punishment is too severe for me He didn't think Moments mercy of his brother, but when he has to pay the price and punishment for it.

He's full of self-pity I'm wounded. I need my self-esteem.

I'm you're going to make me a wanderer and i'll be a candidate for people for others to murder me What a picture of it sounds so much like germany Because they have not acknowledged that they have murdered their brother They have not acknowledged the jew as their brother.

Am I my brother's keeper?

germany would say So lord we just uh, thank you for what you're fingering what you're touching what you're sounding What was at the beginning Is such a foreshadowing of what is coming at the end When did we see you thirsty and hungry when when did we recognize these as your brethren Let alone our brethren And so lord we i'm asking that you would impart Deeply an understanding of your heart in all of this There's a reason why you were so sparing in genesis you why you're so Terse in your statements and so compact that it has to be opened And I pray lord that an opening will come in the sharing of this word in germany, especially And places where it pleases you to bring us that worship is the name of the game Worship is not a little icing on the cake. It's not a little Um Aspect for christian services to make them warm or and enjoyable it's the heart of the whole matter And we pray lord that our own worship would deepen Become every day more authentic and real more Acceptable in your sight that you might take it to yourself and consume it by fire It would be a sweet smelling savor It would not be the expression of what is convenient for us and what is at hand for us that we can do That that we have produced But the acknowledgement my God that everything comes from you So Help us in this lord. We thank you for this precious rich theme And if in any way there's a pattern here That abel had to go Even through death violently imposed by an apostate brother In order to make way for the seth who is given and appointed which is the picture of Israel in its millennial glory that will move all nations To acknowledge the name of the lord Then establish this lord in our understanding and in our speaking this great mystery Thank you lord for your thoughts this morning May they find lodging in our hearts and affect our own attitude our own walk our own relationship Whatever our occupation is may we find pastoral time may we find and seek devotional time? That that that gives you the primary first place And and not an afterthought Thank you lord or else our hearts will be hardened or else we'll become tired Or else we'll become weak or else We will not be able to relate to those who are different from us and for whom we have no affinity in a natural way We will become unnatural And we thank you for for what? Oswald chambers has seen and shared And the precious record in scripture lord that corroborates Thank you, let not this word pass from us Until it performs its work Thank you my God sounded where you will in the earth in Jesus name we pray
