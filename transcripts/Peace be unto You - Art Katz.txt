Peace be unto You - Art Katz

This will be a kind of like preliminary first experience for us getting our feet wet in examining a text and I have to say that for myself probably the most positive benefit of that seminary experience was the discipline of being required to remain within a text and that it made me realize that up until that time I had conducted myself with a certain kind of charismatic and prophetic liberty finding a scripture here and there to make my point but something happens of a very remarkable kind when you confine yourself within a text itself and don't go necessarily outside of it to make your point and let the Lord speak to us from that text it's an intensive burrowing in and it's really amazing the riches that are to be found in in a few verses so here's an episode at the conclusion of the Gospel of John where Jesus reveals himself in his resurrection but not yet ascended form to what to the disciples who are yet full of fear and have not yet sorted out the meaning of the death of the Lord and I don't think that the full implication of his resurrection has yet struck them and in the same breath I would say I don't think it's yet struck us and that there's no limit to what the meaning and implication of the resurrection of Jesus means and that we have all been knocking about on four cylinders rather than six for the want of a deeper appropriation of the meaning of the significant of the resurrection of Jesus so maybe the Lord will open something to us here as we read so from verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands in his side then with the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive you the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained but Thomas one of the 12 called Didymus was not with them when Jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the Lord but he said unto them except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God Jesus saith unto him Thomas because thou hast seen me that has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and many other signs truly that Jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you might have life through his name amen well I'm just inviting you to leap in and to intensively examine this text and just to give you a little teaser in verse 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you so just to raise a question why do you think it is that eight days later eight is the resurrection number Jesus making a second appearance having already revealed himself in his resurrection body to his disciples that the doors would still be shut how do you account for a fear seeing that the Lord has already appeared in his resurrection body which is the testimony of the triumph of the cross that all authority has been given unto him in heaven and earth and yet eight days later they still need a an affirmation or a strengthening of their faith or what do you think that the phrase peace be unto you means do you think that that's just a little courtesy a little courtesy a little polite rhetorical flourish a little Yiddish kite or is Jesus saying something with peace be unto you to terrified disciples that we need to understand because we also are going to experience terror and fright and last days extremity and persecution of a kindred kind so everything that we will be examining in these days is not just merely historical well how did they respond and what were the issues that they face but what's the application for us in the issues that we will face and how secure a grasp do we have of the things pertaining to the resurrection that will constitute our peace and our assurance so you understand what I'm saying okay so let's go back a little over this every time Jesus appears to them the first thing he says is peace be unto you now we can either see that as just a conventional Jewish greeting or something more who here sees that as something more knowing that there's not a syllable in this text or in any of the scriptures that is in any way happenstance there's nothing here that's mere courtesy or conventional every single syllable is charged with enormous divine content and meaning including the amenity of what seems to be just a little gracious greeting peace be unto you if that's more than just a little gracious meaning what is its meaning and why does Jesus repeat it twice and why are they afraid and why are they behind closed doors and to what degree are we behind closed doors you know in a spiritual sense not fully coming into the assurance and confidence that we need to be sent ones on the basis of his resurrection and his authority I always appreciate great questions more than I do correct answers so I'm just operating here to show you and encourage you to theological reflection which is to say the raising of good questions over a text if we can raise the right questions the answers will come and so we just have to acknowledge that we have been slothful ourselves mentally and spiritually lazy and have done what I had done over the years just employ a verse here and there to make a point but this exercise and discipline of getting into a text and burrowing in it and getting from it its meaning and its present and future application is really the choice work of Godly students and we will be enlarged thereby okay that word shalom is just like every other Hebrew word infinitely rich and I'm not gonna give it to you no I don't know but I can but I think it's the kind of thing that we need to explore after all this is actually the first resurrection word that Jesus is speaking to his disciples and of all of the words that he could have employed or chosen he chose this so here too haven't we made that word shalom a kind of an anemic casual expression anybody like we say bless you brother and shalom and part of our function who are jealous for apostolic and prophetic foundations is to restore the integrity of language itself so it's a good thing to ask what does that word really mean and why did Jesus choose to employ it and maybe will not understand that until we spend a few minutes examining what why it is that they are afraid why are they behind closed doors and we don't understand their terror and their fear a lot of this will be lost to us I wonder if there's a kind of a relapse a an effect that follows great events that even the most heroic of God's servants feel a wave of fear that comes over them I don't know if any of you have because you've not experienced great events that's your problem but maybe there is something that we need to sense because we're going we're going to be we are being called to great events and that maybe we can suspect that on the very heels of it comes a remarkable negative reaction where the enemy comes in like a flood and plays upon your weakness your doubting your uncertainty maybe though doubting Thomas was the first to actually to articulate I will not believe to what degree and depth did the others believe even in the seeing of the resurrected Christ because in another text that says they did not yet believe unto joy and the fact that they would yet be behind closed doors eight days later seems to suggest that their belief is not all that it should be because if they had a supreme confidence in the resurrected Lord why are they yet cowering in fear oh you little faith why are you afraid fear is always the antithesis of faith now when Jesus is saying peace be unto you is he making a suggestion or is he declaring an event when Jesus says peace be unto you he's not encouraging you to consider something in your mind he is establishing your peace by his word that's what we need to recognize because the day will come when we will need to establish things by our word so the whole elevator the whole faith in the power of the word and the proclamation of the word needs to be ours so this is not just a little casual greeting this is an event the speaking is itself an event because Jesus appreciates and understands the magnitude of their fear and I want to read to you what I've written here from my paper about that fear it is appropriate and to find the disciples behind locked doors in fear not yet surmising the meaning of the empty tomb that they were assembled for fear of the Jews in verse 19 is perhaps a deeper intimation beyond the levels of human consciousness of the ultimate earthly power expressed through religious and secular means that had just devastatingly brought to death their master and their Lord now I know that when you read something you have to fight for the meaning of it but this is picking up with what Jim touched the same kind of fear that Elijah experienced because what brought Jesus to death was the operation of the powers of darkness expressed through the most the ultimate religious form of Judaism at that time in concert with the ultimate political form of Roman rule and I don't think we can we appreciate this Jesus was the victim of the powers of darkness in their ultimate configuration and these disciples witnessed both his apprehension his suffering and his death they saw the fury of hell poured out on their teacher and coming through the Jewish community principally and I hope I'm not encouraging anybody's anti-semitism but I think that it resides there or has opportunity there beyond anything that we presently recognize there's something about that configuration of things in Jewish religious mentality that was expressed by that high priest that was necessary that one man died for the nation lest we lose our place we need to get a sense of this what what the what the crucifixion of death of Jesus registered upon their souls what what they witnessed it was terrifying because all of them had said though all the world deny you yet will we deny you never and yet when the the night of terror came when Jesus was apprehended and the fact of it struck they all fled and they all betrayed him and some like Peter shamefully so if we're going to appreciate the statement peace be unto you and the confidence that Jesus is wanting to impart by him in the demonstration of himself as resurrected and now I send you as the father has sent me we need to begin with a clearer sense of what their fear is that eight days later they're still behind closed doors it's a fear that nobody in this room has ever yet experienced and some of us in this room will now what is the the anatomy of that fear what what it's the depth of depths it's the enemy poured out bearing his fangs it's seeing how ruthless and how devastating he can be as he ventilated all that is intrinsic to his darkness upon Jesus and left him shredded marred more than any man none of us can imagine what Jesus looked like in his death and one way that we can begin to sense it is the two on the road to Emmaus who were so disconsolate so dejected so broken because they had seen him hang in that pitiful condition that every last hope they had was shredded equally with the shredded Lord so can you know how many of us have ever faced the Jewish community head on how many of us have ever seen behind the facade of politeness and civility and moral and ethical value that the Jewish community endorses something of the antagonism against God that has opportunity there this maybe we'll get to this in another way at some other time but I believe this has everything to do with the historic failure of the church to go to the Jew first and also to the Greek the church has missed the priority of God because it intuitively recognizes just how monumental a threat and how formidable a presence the Jewish thing is they were they were behind closed doors for the fear of the Jews and one of my experiences was speaking at Vassar College in upstate New York and spending the day there and as I passed one of the Jewish students a number of Jews frequent that place this young fellow looked up and he said you'll get yours tonight I thought what does that mean but it wasn't long that I found out that that night as I was preaching on Abraham and circumcision the doors burst open and in came about a dozen black fedora had it bearded Orthodox Hasidim I'll tell you that the mafia would look like Boy Scouts and next to the terror that came into that room and these guys burst in and not one sat they placed themselves strategically around the room and I never watched a congregation of Christians go berserk as I saw them that night it was like lifting the lid off a garbage can you can't imagine what came out fear anger resentment but before that if I had said how many of you here love the Jewish people every hand would have gone up but when the Jewish people came in in the depth of their religious antagonism to God and truth everything changed we were taken by surprised surprise and what we reveal when we're taken by surprise is what we in fact are and one of these guys stood about the distance from me as flora peering at me with burning eyes like I was Hitler himself and then they began to take over and how dare I come with the King James Bible in my ignorance and that that that that it was just an evening never to be forgotten I think I would in terms of stark terror I would say that that night exceeded the occasion at Jack what's his name's church in Los Angeles Heyford when doors burst open again and a band of Jewish radicals like the JDL came walking down each aisle toward me and the guy that was walking down the center aisle had a knit cap and something under it which I thought surely was a vial of acid to be thrown in my face and I was preaching on Act 16 and the apostolic encounter and was happening everyone stopped breathing and what saved the day was that a young brother whom I had just recently baptized a new convert a Hollywood writer too young in the Lord to know better he's about six four or six five got out of a seat and he grabbed this guy by the scruff of the neck and by the seat of his pants and just hoisted him right and I didn't object these are these are little which shall I say pre last days foreshadowings of the kinds of abrupt confrontations that are going to take place particularly in God's last days dealing with the Jewish people who are already so hyper and so sensitive and so defensive of their Jewishness in their insecurity that anything mediated toward them however well-meaning has got to be misunderstood and be misconstrued by them as threat we need to know that it's not going to be apparent to them that we have hearts full of love and desire their redemptive recognition of the Lord to them we represent a threat that is contrary to the thing they want most to preserve namely their very slight sense of Jewishness that is being attacked from every angle even the angle of intermarriage that is already now like 65% of all American Jewish marriages so we're threat and there's something here that is not to be found in any ethnic group this is not your ordinary resistance to the gospel there's something here of an additional kind that is at the heart of the powers of darkness of this present world that has employed my people unhappily throughout their whole apostasy to be the agents even unwittingly of these powers to bring about schemes and devices contrary to God's intention like Marxism and all of the other kinds of things in which we Jews have been so expert have you noticed that the Lord does not encourage us to try it out in the sticks first and then if it works there you bring it into the big city and and put it up on Broadway he says begin at Jerusalem where I was crucified where the prophets were stoned then you can go to Samaria and the uttermost corners of the earth don't begin where it's easiest begin where it's hardest like fright from the beginning head on meet the issue don't don't delay face it in the authority that is mine by virtue of my obedience to the father unto death and resurrection all authority is given it to me now that's what he says but when he's not visibly present can you still believe that and face the outraged Jewish community that has just crucified him and will crucify others who continue in the same truth that he exemplified I think that what we're missing is a sense of the scandal of the gospel the terrible offense of the gospel as as it is most revealed when it comes into confrontation with everything that men celebrate as wisdom as righteousness as religion as morality as ethics as culture which we Jews have developed and propounded to the farthest state the point of greatest antagonism in conflict is where the foolishness and the scandal of the gospel meets the wisdom of the world head-on and that's represented by the Jewish community that has just crucified that wisdom and now these who were the observers of that terror the ferocity of it the unveiled what sort of bestiality are now going to have to go into the same place and continue the work that he began the same messianic task as the father has sent me so send I you I can just hear them saying great you know like what else is new and you you pick up where I left off you you continue in the thing that eventuated in my crucifixion and of course what do we know that not one of these men survived and with the exception of John to die a natural death every single one of them suffered a violent death and if this is the commencement of the gospel dispensation the beginning of it descending by the resurrected one what will be its conclusion in the last days and don't we again need therefore to fully appropriate the assurance and the peace that the Jesus gave or it has yet not stumbled on the antagonism that the gospel is to the world and maybe part of the reason is because our gospel is not that gospel it's not the gospel of the kingdom it does not threaten the status quo does not unseat the security and the whole mindset and way of life of people who consider and receive it by making the decision but but maybe when it becomes this gospel again to radically unturn everything that a person to which a person has given himself then we're going to know and the reaction of violence against us so these this is good to begin to borrow in and understand what's represented in just these few verses let me finish this statement here I'll read it again it is appropriate to find then to find the disciples behind locked doors and fear not yet surmising the meaning of the empty tomb that they were assembled for fear of the Jews quote and unquote is perhaps a deeper intimation beyond the levels of human consciousness of the ultimate earthly power expressed religious and secular means that had just devastatingly brought to death their master and their Lord all that stands for authority and power of the present age politically and religiously had triumphed its visibility and impressiveness having all the marble so to speak continues it is indeed something to be feared for the powers of hell are resident in it and the church that fails still to see this cannot itself appropriate in full the resurrection mandate or power and must as time itself I think has corroborated turn Easter into a chocolate bunnies spring event let me go over that last piece there if we don't understand the reason for their fear will not be able to appropriate the reason for their confidence and their peace and we will turn the resurrection event into a kind of cultural celebration which it has become this resurrection we're missing it at every point we don't know as we ought to know we don't understand and know God as we ought the gospel is a parody of what it was at the first and needs again to become the resurrection has only become a doctrine to which we subscribe as being correct the world has denigrated it and made it only a kind of Easter Sunday chocolate bunny egg rolling thing that's why we need to go back to the first we need to go back to the beginning and dig out this event here that's being described it's been lost and so it will not have the meaning for us that we that it's that we need unless we can begin by proper beginning to assess the fear we haven't even begun to look at and Jesus breathed the spirit upon them receiving the Holy Spirit what would you rather receive the continuing physical and visible presence of the Lord or the spirit that is given because he's going to be absent from us and on the basis of what he has breathed and on the basis of where he's spoken will that be sufficient for you to establish you in what the shalom of God is which is not just a Shabbat night greeting but shalom in the moment when the doors burst open and the Hasidim come in that that's when you shalom of God anybody can have it when the candles are burning and we're having a little Yiddish kite and a nice evening but the issue of our peace is in the midst of threat in the midst of terror will we then be at peace because the Lord had said so and because he has breathed his spirit into us this is the way the whole gospel dispensation begins and this is the way therefore it is going to end it's always true that as also in the beginning so also in the end and that's why we need to get this beginning into our own spirits even to the place where it becomes for us a place of true beginning so that wherever we are spiritually behind closed doors fearful threatened intimidated subscribing to correct doctrines about resurrection and even speaking the word shalom yet thrilling for the reality of it we need to come through into something on the basis of this text these things are written that you might believe verse 31 now how come that's there exactly for this that you who's the you the Lord anticipating the generations of believers that will follow even us now in this moment these things are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you might have life through his name that word life what what synonym would you put there for life what what is implied in life that you would you have physical biological continuation what's the life the life is what you exhibit when the Hasidim are as close to you as flora and are spitting in your face and calling you every name in the book and your mind goes blank and you can't think of a clever thing to say to rebuke them what comes forth then has got to be the life of the Lord how come art because it's not your reputation that's writing in that moment it's the eternal issue of their salvation who have come to harass to mock and to destroy nevertheless they're coming head-to-head with a piece of the resurrected Christ in us and what he will say and exhibit in the power of that life may have a depth of penetration that only eternity will reveal you know I'm a man of very poor memory but here's one thing I remember about that night as this guy who was closest to me was railing at one point he said and we know that you love us cats but and then he went on to say something else but I I didn't hear the rest of it I thought to myself I never told you that how do you know that I don't know where he got that we had never met before whether it's by reputation or something communicated I don't know but that you might have life by believing in his name let me just take a moment's breath right here do you realize that every single thing that we have been considering so far stands perilously in danger of becoming religion his name can become a formula resurrection can become a mindless doctrine to which we give assent shalom could become a cutesy little benediction everything that is charged here with such replete meaning as end time provision for us can if we miss it by ever so little become transmuted into religion so that in his name becomes a formula that if you rub the genie lamp in the name of Jesus something comes out we have got to contend for the faith Saints once and for all given the Saints and that's what we are presently doing and will do in all these days we are starting easy this is a light exercise nevertheless it contains all of the elements that will be with us in every time we sit down together to consider the things of God we need to realize that the world the flesh and the devil has a remarkable facility to transmute the holy things of God and turn them into religious pap so we have got to fight and go back in and get the original meaning and make it our own or we are goners when the doors burst open and the unexpected thing comes for which we are not fitted because we do not believe in the peace of God we do not believe in the name of God and have not appropriated the things that are made available through his resurrection are you following me that's why we're we're probing here nothing is more viciously opposed to the faith than religion we all know and that's what terrified Elijah and terrifies them when religion is threatened and we're gonna hopefully get into this what is religion and why is it inimical to God one of the greatest ironies and paradox that that which purports to be about God is most opposed to God and opposed violently and ruthlessly you need to understand that and to recognize what religion is so whether it comes from Jews let me say this what we're calling Jewish is probably also Protestant denominational Catholic all of the intrinsic elements that made up the Judaism that crucified Christ is yet to be found in all normative and conventional religious bodies today and that though we are presently in a quiescent mood where they are not expressing an antagonism to the apostolic faith it will not long remain that when the faith that is true begins to confront them you can expect there will be the mask off and the fangs bared and the same hostility again revealed so we're preparing ourselves for soon coming eventually that's a good point it's not when we say Jewish we're getting at something much deeper and it's to be found in every religious and institutional thing that is opposed to true faith you might just make a little note for yourself and reflect on this and maybe write up a couple paragraphs what is the nature of religion and why is it antagonistic to God to the point of crucifying with devastating brutality the God whom it presumes to celebrate this is a this is not an option this is requirement unless you understand this the whole last days will be a mystery to you and you'll be unfitted not only to serve in the last days but to stand because one of the most vital aspects will be a last day's confrontation between religious and political system Jezebel and Ahab versus the Elijah band the true prophetic faith so we need to understand what is there about the nature of religion by by its very nature that makes it so intrinsically opposed to God even in the name of God and if we had time and we had ability to begin to describe the horrendous assault on the sons and daughters of God through history the blood would rise to the ceilings that the roll call of martyrs of tortured victims it's not just people put to death put to death with spite with maliciousness with with delight in seeing them suffer there's something in the spirit of the of religion that is so inimical to God and to God's people that we need to understand which had just been abruptly demonstrated to these disciples when they saw it visited upon Jesus we need to understand their fear let's look into this into the text is he pushing them out from behind closed doors where does it show us that and a for the day for the first one who spots it peace be to you as the father sent me I also send you okay verse 21 this isn't Jesus coming to give them a little pat on the back this is Jesus coming to send so sending receiving the Holy Spirit the word of peace everything is set in these few verses so we need let's let's dwell on that for a bit as my father had sent me even so send by you why didn't he just say I'm sending you what does he even have to refer to as my father had sent me what what purpose does that serve if every word is of God what purpose does that would serve good so the sending is not a kind of a technical ministerial thing but something that relationship and if the relationship is not there you're not being sent as he was sent nor will you have a comparable result as the father had sent me so send by you so the sending comes out of a relationship with the father with a knowledge of God or that sending is vain and what question rises in your mind like if that's true art then what can we say about the preponderance of religious things that the church has been doing historically since that time and now even today how much of our acts and religious activity is out of ascending derived from relationship with the father and how many of us would not presume to go until that relationship is sure and don't think that by these few questions we're exhausting what is implied in this that as my father has sent me so send that you it's in the same character it's in keeping with his same purpose it will be in the same power it comes out of the same relationship you're going to be a continuum of what I have expressed till now no small thing to men who are terrified and sitting behind locked doors and the whole destiny and future of the gospel endeavor rests on their ability to do it or there's no continuation and no future how do you like them apples the faith of God in fact we can even make a little collection of the last comments of these men though the world and I you never and later on even Peter saying what and what shall this man do and there's still a competition of striving and jealousy I mean God is taking some really crude material and charging them with the same commission that he himself had talk about the faith of God has anything changed since that time has the Lord revised the strategy is there any work that can be considered God's work today that is significant and messianic apostolic that can be performed outside of this context maybe just to take a moment and talk about how ministerially minded we are particularly as Westerners and as Americans very little thought about relationship but everything about doing and having a ministry and what are you doing and what are you performing it's not the emphasis of the Lord at all we need to be we would be restored to something that relationship precedes service and relationship of a very particular kind of the kind that the son had with the father I'll tell you that might call for like a moratorium on all present activity for a considerable time to let relationship be established and in fact what has more most threatened that kind of relationship but the activity itself in fact the activity probably stands as a substitute for the relationship because it's tougher to be than it is to do God's doing always comes out of being be not afraid please be unto you the emphasis is on being who can figure out why verse 23 is included in this text at all how did that get in there what does that got to do with what we're talking about doesn't seem to be like a detour why why would sin now come into the discussion and that that those to whom he's speaking and breathing his spirit will have an authority to remit or to retain sins whose sins do you think is being referred to here is it the world is it the unbelieving world is it the hostile Jews about they're afraid they have more to do with their own sense than has to do with the sins outside of them and why would that be expressed now right after as my father had sent me so send I you can you have can you have a relationship with the father that would qualify for ascending and have inadequate relationship with your brothers no way so they're going to take this formula for sending seriously of a relationship with the father what is the implication of the relationship with themselves who were jealous divisive competitive calling down fire from heaven what shall this man do something is not being stated but it's being implied that if you're going to get this right before you're sent sin is going to surface and I'm giving you an authority to deal with it I think that the key point is that if relationship is the key to sending with the father then there's an implication of relationship with the brothers and if that's going to be made right sin is going to surface and have to be dealt with in fact who can read who can cite a text that shows that the first apostolic sending clearly is an expression of a body that had come to a place beyond its sins against itself they had come to a place of authentic relationship and then the Lord said okay now separate on to me where is that found in the acts 13 when they were found ministering unto the Lord together the Holy Ghost said separate unto me Paul and bottomless for the work when to when the Lord saw that the truth of their relationship was reflected in the truth of their worship then the sending was made possible why is this thing about sin preceded by receiving the Holy Ghost and your answer to that or your inability to answer that is the statement of your own inadequate relationship in the body your lack of the knowledge of church as community will be reflected right now in your inability to understand the connection between receiving the Holy Ghost and those who sins you remit those rethink is this Holy Ghost a power for serving do you think or is it a power for something else there's nothing more grueling and more demanding and more exhausting than relationship true relationship in the body of Christ that's the way I would express it and there's no way that you're going to perform that out of your own well-meaning intention and nice guy ism and strength you'll be exhausted in the first week this is that we need a power just to be to each other what we must before we can be it in the world you got that in your notes that's a statement for today and that's the conjunction that I see between Jesus breathing his spirit upon them and then saying now remit sins what is that some kind of light bookkeeping anyone who's ever had to deal with sin in the body knows how exhausting and draining those questions are and the reason that we don't know them is that we are not in that kind of context our Sunday Christianity does not provide an occasion for dealing with sin with judging with retaining or remanding we're just we were passive we're sitting in pews we're listening to a biblical sermon where we're singing choruses we put our we're taking the collection and we leave that's what is no apostolic sending saints what is the Lord is the Lord doing drawing our attention to the foundation we wish we've been so ministerially minded and wanting to do and go in all our cheap immature condition and God said before you go anywhere before you think to do anything for me if you are sending is going to be like my sending and be as fruitful as mine was you need first to attend to this and you'll not be able to do it except by the power that I will give you it's interesting that the denominations that have most refuted the necessity for this power of the spirit are those whose religious formulas are most predictable where there's no requirement made on the passive congregation at all everything is off the elevated platform by men who have been credentialed and who perform and exercise all the needful things but we're coming back to the things as they were in the beginning how was it originally from square one Jesus crucified now resurrected and now coming and making his first presentation of himself to his own disciples terrified with fear who have yet a mandate and a calling for which their three-year walk with the Lord is not yet sufficient preparation and even this breathing of the Holy Spirit is that the full and final provision there's still a Pentecost ahead of which this is the intimation in fact I would think that this breathing of the spirit is more for us than it was for them namely to show us the conjunction between the power necessary for true relationship that proceeds sending then then what they in fact actually received if they receive then all that they needed Pentecost would not have been necessary for them so the Lord is just gave an intimation a faint installment to show the order I'll tell you this morning is doing nothing more for us than this it's worth it namely showing there's not a verse in the scripture that is out of place there's a divine logic set one upon the other if we could but see the unfolding of it of why it is inserted as it is and in that order I'll tell you what this might change the whole way in which we see the scripture and I want to go on record as saying that I have been guilty for years before my seminary experience of reading the scriptures hurriedly shallowly and quickly I did not invest myself in the word I read it like a narrative I owe this oh he said to this many won't and he said that and they said and then and then Thomas and other and okay next chapter so we need to have our minds what's the word we mindset of how what our approach to the scripture is a tangential thing but we're seeing it from the beginning we have been much too casual about the Word of God much too facile much too quick we have not brooded over the text over the verses what does this mean why is he saying that of all the things that could be said what does he say that why are they in that situation behind locked doors why does he have to come again why why this reference to sin why the breathe so this is a first day's beginning to get our mindsets rightly aligned so that from henceforth whatever we examine we're going to examine it as serious students of the word who will not allow a single syllable to slip pondering weighing examining probing how does this relate to this relating scripture to scripture and I think it's going to become another kind of book for us how explicitly does sin affect relationship adversely what is loving the brother have to do with sin as if as if the failure to love a brother is the statement of sin who can explain that it's I think that's true why because his love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit and what grieves and makes the spirit to recoil the Holy Spirit the spirit of holiness but sin so sin requiring the spirit to recoil takes with him the love that he would otherwise shed abroad in the heart and so one of the things that we see is a loveless saint toward the brethren is really the statement of his sin so that that's an answer to my question how does sin affect relationship the Lord is in very few words what shall I say he's laying the foundations for the church he's showing no relationship with the father except yourselves also equally and rightly related the horizontal bar of the cross with the vertical and there'll be no horizontal relationship except to be in truth and in righteousness which sin will adversely affect and if you're going to face the issues of sin and judgment and discipline and chastising of brothers of judging sin of assessing it you're gonna need my power all of this is implied in being sent as I have been sent well let's let's stop there and take a break in there and I'll leave you with one question as you take your break how can this in fact be actually fulfilled in the last days except that we again be back into a context of relationship where we would know each other so well and be in an atmosphere of conducive love and righteousness that we can address the issues of sin and character that they might be ascending doesn't this require not just an adjustment of our minds but the adjustment of our whole church structure if indeed there's going to be ascending as I send you and if there is no such sending what is the consequence for the nations what ministry in fact are they receiving what eternal things are really being propounded and affected because those whom God sends turn the world upside down those whom he sends bear his word and to them he gives the spirit without measure so we need to have a revival of apostolic desire willing for the sacrifice that will make it again a possibility and the reality and that's what this school is about and that's why it itself has been born and is continuing in a community setting where those realities have their expression so this is going to cost something to forsake conventional church structures in which we have been enabled to live safely without being found out because we're not in the intensity of relationship by which it would be and it's not required of us so long as we're physically present for services see we're going to be earnest about this is going to be cost but until it comes what can we hope for in the last days and in the world because we're going to face intimidation through the factors that are coming in these last days that will be visible and external you know what faith is a confidence resting on something invisible in the face of something threatening and visible right what is faith a definition it's the contest between a confidence resting on that which is invisible in the face of that which is visible namely threat intimidation the powers of this world have all of the models that were confronted by the things that are visible and they are formidable form it up just the sight of them the the accoutrements of civilization against our little puny ridiculous foolish vain faith is the whole issue of what we are about so Jesus standing in the midst of them in that situation said peace be unto you it's something like the Mount of Transfiguration where Jesus appears with Moses and Elijah and the Peter and John and who was the other one went down on their faces James went down on their faces and Jesus touched them and said be not afraid see we we read those things as if it's a suggestion we don't read those things as if they are creative proclamations that create being unafraid be not afraid something is going to come into your being contrary to fear by virtue of my word now if the Lord would have said to us this morning be not afraid no matter what the future holds no matter what uncertainty no matter what confrontation with things formidable and visible in that moment be not afraid will you be it will your being receive and reflect the creative word of God sufficient to nullify fear and being incapacitated when you see the things that are visible that's how extraordinarily important that statement of Jesus was to them when he stood in the midst of them and everything is not only for them but for us also upon whom the ends of the age have come in a word can we live by the word of God that no matter what we see no matter what faces us the Lord has said be not afraid peace be with you maybe we need to come back to Bobby's question well what is shalom is it a kind of psychological psychological smooth thing where something is glossed over and a little waving of a magical wand that you feel better is is peace is so shallow a thing with God the shalom of God is that all that it is peace I mean it's the very antithesis for which the world is dying for the want of this shalom it's not a superficial brushing over it's something deep coming into a man in the vital places where he lives where fear is the existential place I don't have a word to describe it no matter how formidable we ourselves are or whatever our experience our strength in the depths of us there's a fluttering weak piece of humanity and that's where God speaks his word here's what I wrote Jesus came and stood in front of them and in the way that we've read are we not to understand that just as in the mouth of transfiguration event we got to see no man not to be intimidated by the visible and external factors but to see Jesus only to see him not only as resurrected but to receive from him in the authority conferred by the word that actually creates our peace no matter how formidable and challenging our circumstances should I say that again or is it on tape or no matter how formidable and challenging our circumstances to have a faith that receives from him the creative word that establishes our peace the un the last days are charged with great uncertainty there's a question we don't know what form it will take what how will it express itself what things will break upon us with suddenness but in view of all that God has spoken peace be unto you my peace I give unto you let's look in John 16 maybe we'll catch something of that 1633 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world so everything rests on the spoken word and if we cannot receive the value of the spoken word that constitutes for us an event how shall we ourselves speak a word that will constitute for others an event for as your faith is so be it unto you and anyone here who has heard my Ezekiel 37 message knows that everything in the last analysis is predicated upon the ability of a last days church to speak a word to Israel then in its grave that will raise it from its death an ultimate prophetic word that comes not as suggestion but as events come forth and our ability to speak it is the reflection of our ability first to receive it because if we cannot believe that word from God for us how shall we believe that word for others through us so there needs to be an elevation or an escalation of our whole appreciation of the word of God not for instruction however precious that is or even inspiration but as event and I can say from my own little experience that more and more now as I'm speaking I'm seeing that and even announcing that that what you're hearing from me is not intended for your instruction it's intended for your event before you heard you with something else now that you've heard you this that the word itself is a creative event and that's the first activity of the resurrected Christ to his disciples and it has got to be for us again the last because we're going to face things that will terrify but may that word resound in our hearing echo in our spirits the Lord has said peace be unto you I'm not going to be deflected by what I'm seeing I don't give a rap for the uncertainty of the things I can't know for the future I don't care how terrifying the present confrontation is the Lord has said peace and therefore in the shalom of God I will now believe in everything that his name confers as life and answer that situation because if we act in fear we are no longer in faith and what issues from us therefore is valueless we just need to be reminded that the economy of God the way of God is so contrary to the flesh God is predicating everything on the word that he speaks we're not accustomed to giving credence to words to that degree if you notice the text when he showed them his wounds it says then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord verse 20 the last part of verse 20 of John 20 it doesn't say they were glad when they heard the Lord they were glad when they saw the Lord they were more comforted by a physical and visible reassurance than the word that was spoken and that's how out the world attenuates us we're comforted by the things that we can touch feel see I'm secure because I've got this bank account or this brother this you know but to predicate everything upon a word see how radical a thing is required of us a real revolution in our whole perception of what reality is this is reality heaven and earth will pass away but my word will endure forever so I think the answer to your question is we've not believed and our fear betrays us our fear reveals it God has spoken but we have cast the word away we've not taken it as a creative word maybe a suggestion and isn't that the way that we speak also we speak by suggestion and not by conviction we don't expect others to receive our word as being absolute it's tentative it's you know kind of a suggestion and therefore we project upon God the same low value that we assess to our own speaking and that of others in fact I have said many times what you do with this message having spoken to a congregation is critical not only for your future but for your eternal future whether you will see it and receive it as a message or as the word of God as event how do you choose to hear it you want to receive it as a suggestion or will you receive it as commandment and as creative word and I think that of course it's obvious people don't want to be required of when God speaks something's required or he's not speaking God does not speak for effect so we'd much rather have the word as suggestion the word is homily the word as devotion the word as inspiration not the word as event that requires this event requires us not to be afraid when those doors come breaking in not to be afraid so the piece that is now being creatively expressed through the word has first been obtained through suffering at the cross Lord is not conferring some light amenity he's conferring a substantial event that was won and obtained by his own suffering and death at the cross therefore he alone is authorized to speak it my piece it's not anybody my piece that I have so painfully obtained through suffering now I confer to you we avoid situations where the peace of God would be required that is to say we want to regulate our life where we can handle it and conduct it on the basis of our own ability and need not to create a word of God we're unwilling to pull out the stops and put ourselves in a place of extremity that requires God's peace now how does doubting Thomas come into all this is it just a historical accident that he was not there when Jesus appeared to the disciples or is God staging something even through the unbelief of a disciple to communicate something of importance let's let's look at that verse 24 but Thomas one of the twelve was not with them when Jesus came well what a remarkable coincidence the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the Lord notice not that we have also heard from the Lord what he said unto them except I shall see notice every everything is predicated on seeing seeing seeing seeing their Jews they fleshly men they want that visible assurance except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the nails and thrust my hand to side I will not believe what do you think of a statement of that kind a man who's going to mock himself by that statement as doubting Thomas throughout history I will not except I shall see what do you think it is that though they told him that they had seen the Lord he did not get we need to borrow in to get a portrait of Thomas because he's quintessential Saint is a Thomas in all of us and I will not except I shall see and refusing to believe the testimony of his brethren what does this what kind of a portrait is being given here is this is this a man in relationship in the body he doesn't trust the community he's a self-willed individualist he's got to establish it himself or it's or it's not valid no wonder they needed the power of the spirit than dealing with Thomas and reckoning over the issue of sin because that which is not of faith is sin so that we don't know what the sins what's Thomas's sins were it's evident that they existed or he would not be unbelieving and probably that the sin is a self-willed individualism of a guy who does his own thing and has only his confidence in himself and will not receive from his brethren I will not believe the issue of resurrection is the name of the game it's the issue of the faith because if there's no resurrection we of all men are most to be pitied and certainly it's not enough merely to give creedal affirmation to the doctrine of resurrection but to believe in the actual power that raises the dead and makes those things to be which were not now not only does Jesus allow Thomas to put his fingers in his wounds but he even speaks something in that power into that man with do you see that in the text not only does it not reprimand him but a personal creative word for himself maybe the depth of his disappointment was greater than all the rest maybe it sank in more deeply maybe the picture of Jesus utterly spoiled at the cross utterly racked gangrenous if you have anyone who's seen that Gruenwald masterpiece of Jesus on the cross knows what Thomas must have seen no hope I mean utterly devoid of life and therefore because of a greater depth of the apprehension of the death the Lord is graciously giving him a greater revelation of the reality of the life and here okay maybe that's one of the reasons why we are lacking in resurrection faith because we're lacking in the appropriation of the death we have been superficial about the cross and therefore we have condemned ourselves to a superficiality about the resurrection we ourselves need to go back to the place of the beginning and recognize the magnitude of that death and our death if we're going to appropriate the life so these are great conjunctions great events what do you make of 29 where Jesus said because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed would you say more blessed or are you are you blessed because you have believed or you believe because you're blessed that's no small question nor you took something visible but those who will believe because I will confer a faith are blessed they are blessed to believe something that except I confer it they cannot believe it because resurrection is calculated to be an ultimate offense to human intellect and credit and credibility and if you believe it it's only because I have given you the faith to believe it I have blessed you to believe it you have required to see it but blessed are they who believe it without saying that's being blessed and it puts the entire premium upon God in a word God has set up a situation that except that he reveals it no man can obtain it that means that there are unnumbered tens of thousands of court Christians sitting in churches who are subscribing to the doctrine of resurrection as being true who have who are not blessed they have never really believed an ultimately impossible thing to believe because it has not been given them by God and maybe the reason is is that they're satisfied with shallow creedal acceptance and don't want the of a believing for the resurrection life lest they be required to exhibit it themselves getting the picture of what religion is the only recently the Lord broke upon my heart that you can just as easily become deceived sitting in a Orthodox Christian church whose tenets and doctrines are valid as you can by being a Mormon or a Jehovah's Witness or any other set you can be you can be deceived even subscribing to the truth because you're not holding the truth in righteousness but just being satisfied with the superficial creedal statement of it and about it I'm glad this is going on tape and by the way these remarks that are coming out of me are the statement of that life and I haven't rehearsed this and this is the life speaking and underlining and affirming things that God wants to sink deep into our hearing and understanding and I'll make this final statement the final contest between what is apostate and what is apostolic will be between those who hold the doctrine of revelation of resurrection as doctrine as against those who eminently walk in the power of it that's the final picture of the final clash of the persecutors and the persecuted not the world and the church but those who purport to be church because they subscribe to the Orthodox views of it but refuse to walk in the power of it as against those who do there's nothing more offensive still than the exhibition of the reality of resurrection life they are the blessed ones and wherever the blessed are there'll be those who want to quench their light and we need to ask ourselves Lord have I been dangerously flirting with just mere acceptance of resurrection as doctrine without any real serious intent to live in the power of that life because he who is blessed blesses others and except that we bless others in the power of the resurrection we bring no blessing we have to do for the doubting Thomas's of our generation what Jesus did for him by speaking a word and resurrection power being not faithless but be believing be it's more than a head trip I wonder if there is such a thing as apostolic faith that is not the result of something creatively imparted in resurrection power by the risen Lord himself and what is a false apostle are those who traffic in the language of apostolicity who have never had this blessing conferred where I've never said that before but we may be touching something very significant here how can there be apostolic works except that of an apostolic faith that has been given by thought by him who sense as my father sent me so send I you by speaking this word into you which is the foundation of your faith not your mental deduction a logical summing up of the truths of the faith but an actual importation in resurrection power will not be afraid and you'll be blessed and you'll be a blessing what would you say is offensive to about what we are now saying not not to men in the world and not even to religious people but even to spirit-filled charismatic and evangelical Christians of what we are now saying about what constitutes true blessedness here's here's really the a for the day the student who can see this is getting to the heart of the matter of the deepest offense to man what is that offense nothing from you at all and everything from me except I confer it except I give it except I send it you have nothing you are nothing I am all in all nothing from you nothing from man nothing from your well meaning religious disposition to do for me I am all in all I am the creator God I am the resurrected one I'm the authoritative one you have only to go but only in my power and in my blessedness you remember when God sent Moses out of the burning bush could there have been a more remarkable man who had the best of both worlds Hebrew of the Hebrews I mean he had a lineage that was so distinguished and also a prince of Egypt he had the advantage of the greatest erudition and learning available in his generation but when God sent him not when he sent himself and only slew an Egyptian lay him in the sand when God sent them Moses said who am I that I should go for you and God never argued with him I will be with you that's the basis for your being sent that's that's the heart of what is apostolic nothing of you in yourself that's true I've allowed you to brew for 40 years over what was the unhappy fruit of your self-initiated doing for me but now I will send you and I will be with you how else did you think to confront Satan who is Pharaoh and this at its root is the heart of all offense to man when Jesus said accepted the father draw you no man can company except the front many turned away from him in that day and followed him no longer because everything that had to do with man and what man could perform on man's ability or man's convictions or man's principles or man's religion was completely removed except the father drew you we need to recognize this it's the heart of all offense and it may even more than we realize offend us if there's anything lurking yet lingering that wants to express itself as our accomplishment for God I'm not talking about carnality I'm talking about spirituality wanting to do significant things for God but out of ourselves then this cuts us off at the path pass and maybe it's for this reason that this episode is set in yes you have seen but now blessed are they who believe the same thing not seeing without seeing they'll believe it because they're blessed they'll not be blessed because they believe it see to me are we on that ground that's apostolic ground and I'll tell you to come on that ground it's worth being a doubting Thomas it's worth finding yourself in opposition to God and not being aware of it till he'll bring us through to this place where the issue of blessedness really lies Paul said that except you pray for me said that I might have grace for utterance how shall I speak you know the things that I thought it's got to be given you're again and again dependent on that which is given and only on that basis can we go can we be sent once fearful what if God fails to provide and do you want the doors have burst in and income the the Hasidim foaming at the mouth with their black fedora hats and beards and black eyes and and ventilating all of their hatred and fury and except God say or do something in that moment I mean then what and as the father has sent me so send I you how did the father sent Jesus did he give him everything in advance and forewarn him of every situation and tell him how he's gonna Jesus lived as the man of faith by the spirit utterly dependent on the father moment by moment for what is given it's the most humiliating dependency and who wants it who has grown up in this world and gone to college and has been taught how to be self-sufficient and God says that's the world here's the way of my kingdom total dependence on me to whom all the starters can get now go ye into all the world and preach this gospel to every creature well let me read from Oswald chambers selection of August 13th unquench not the spirit the voice of the spirit is as gentle as a Zephyr so gentle that unless you are living in perfect communion with God you never hear it the checks of the spirit come in the most extraordinarily gentle gentle ways and if you are not sensitive enough to detect his voice you will quench it and your personal spiritual life will be impaired his checks always come as a still small voice so small that no one but the saint I wrote true saint notices them everything is predicated if you're going to receive from the God who gives both leadings and checks you have got to be in an extraordinary relationship with the God who sends as my father sent me so send I you or you're going to miss it you'll not hear it you'll not be able to receive it you'll be so taken in by the noise and the confusion or the fear that you'll miss the still small voice maybe we should spend a little time in prayer okay Sandy this will be a kind of like preliminary first experience for us getting our feet wet in examining a text I have to say that for myself probably the most positive benefit of that seminary experience was the discipline of being required to remain within a text and that it made me realize that up until that time I had conducted myself with a certain kind of charismatic and prophetic liberty finding a scripture here and there to make my point but something happens of a very remarkable kind when you confine yourself within a text itself and don't go necessarily outside of it to make your point and let the Lord speak to us from that text it's an intensive burrowing in and it's really amazing the riches that are to be found in in a few verses so here's an episode at the conclusion of the gospel of John where Jesus reveals himself in his resurrection but not yet ascended form to what to the disciples who are yet full of fear and have not yet sorted out the meaning of the death of the Lord and I don't think that the full implication of his resurrection has yet struck them and in the same breath I would say I don't think it's yet struck us and that there's no limit to what the meaning and implication of the resurrection of Jesus means and that we have all been knocking about on four cylinders rather than six for the want of a deeper appropriation of the meaning of the significant of the resurrection of Jesus so maybe the Lord will open something to us here as we read so from verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands in his side then with the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receiving the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained but Thomas one of the twelve called Didymus was not with them when Jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the Lord but he said unto them except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God Jesus saith unto him Thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed and many other signs truly that Jesus and the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing you might have life through his name amen well I'm just inviting you to leap in and to intensively examine this text and just to give you a little teaser in verse 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you so just to raise a question why do you think it is that eight days later eight is the resurrection number Jesus making a second appearance having already revealed himself in his resurrection body to his disciples that the doors would still be shut how do you account for a fear seeing that the Lord has already appeared in his resurrection body which is the testimony of the triumph of the cross that all authority has been given unto him in heaven earth and yet eight days later they still need a an affirmation or a strengthening of their faith or what do you think that the phrase peace be unto you means do you think that that's just a little courtesy a little courtesy a little polite rhetorical flourish a little Yiddish kite or is Jesus saying something with peace be unto you to terrified disciples that we need to understand because we also are going to experience terror and fright and last days extremity and persecution of a kindred kind so everything that we will be examining in these days is not just merely historical well how did they respond and what were the issues that they faced but what's the application for us in the issues that we will face and how secure a grasp do we have of the things pertaining to the resurrection that will constitute our peace and our assurance so you understand what I'm saying okay so let's go back a little over this every time Jesus appears to them the first thing he says is peace be unto you now we can either see that as just a conventional Jewish greeting or something more who here sees that as something more knowing that there's not a syllable in this text or in any of the scriptures that is in any way happenstance there's nothing here that's mere curtsy or conventional every single syllable is charged with enormous divine content and meaning including the amenity of what seems to be just a little gracious greeting peace be unto you if that's more than just a little gracious meaning what is its meaning and why does Jesus repeat it twice and why are they afraid and why are they behind closed doors and to what degree are we behind closed doors you know in a spiritual sense not fully coming into the assurance and confidence that we need to be sent ones on the basis of his resurrection and his authority I always appreciate great questions more than I do correct answers so I'm just operating here to show you and encourage you to theological reflection which is to say the raising of good questions over a text if we can raise the right questions the answers will come and so we just have to acknowledge that we have been slothful ourselves mentally and spiritually lazy and have done what I had done over the years just employ a verse here and there to make a point but this exercise and discipline of getting into a text and burrowing in it and getting from its meaning and its present and future application is really the choice work of Godly students and we will be enlarged thereby okay that word shalom is just like every other Hebrew word infinitely rich and I'm not going to give it to you no I don't know but I can but I think it's the kind of thing that we need to explore after all this is actually the first resurrection word that Jesus is speaking to his disciples and of all of the words that he could have employed or chosen he chose this so here too haven't we made that word shalom a kind of an anemic casual expression anybody like we say bless you brother and shalom and part of our function who are jealous for apostolic and prophetic foundations is to restore the integrity of language itself so it's a good thing to ask what does that word really mean and why did Jesus choose to employ it and maybe we'll not understand that until we spend a few minutes examining what why it is that they are afraid why are they behind closed doors and we don't understand their terror and their fear a lot of this will be lost to us I wonder if there's a kind of relapse a an effect that follows great events that even the most heroic of God's servants feel a wave of fear that comes over them I don't know if any of you have because you've not experienced great events that's your problem but maybe there is something that we need to sense because we're going we're going to be we are being called to great events and that maybe we can suspect that on the very heels of it comes a remarkable negative reaction where the enemy comes in like a flood and plays upon your weakness your doubting your uncertainty maybe though doubting Thomas was the first to actually to articulate I will not believe to what degree and depth did the others believe even in the seeing of the resurrected Christ because in another text that says they did not yet believe unto joy and the fact that they would yet be behind closed doors eight days later seems to suggest that their belief is not all that it should be because if they had a supreme confidence in the resurrected Lord why are they yet cowering in fear oh you little faith why are you afraid fear is always the antithesis of faith now when Jesus is saying peace be unto you is he making a suggestion or is he declaring an event when Jesus says peace be unto you he's not encouraging you to consider something in your mind he is establishing your peace by his word that's what we need to recognize because the day will come when we will need to establish things by our word so the whole elevator the whole faith in the power of the word and the proclamation of the word needs to be ours so this is not just a little casual greeting this is an event the speaking is itself an event because Jesus appreciates and understands the magnitude of their fear and I want to read to you what I've written here from my paper about that fear it is appropriate and to find the disciples behind locked doors in fear not yet surmising the meaning of the empty tomb that they were assembled for fear of the Jews in verse 19 is perhaps a deeper intimation beyond the levels of human consciousness of the ultimate earthly power expressed through religious and secular means that had just devastatingly brought to death their master and their Lord now I know that when you read something you have to fight for the meaning of it but this is picking up with what Jim touched the same kind of fear that Elijah experienced because what brought Jesus to death was the operation of the powers of darkness expressed through the most the ultimate religious form of Judaism at that time in concert with the ultimate political form of Roman rule and I don't think we can we appreciate this Jesus was the victim of the powers of darkness in their ultimate configuration and these disciples witnessed both his apprehension his suffering and his death they saw the fury of hell poured out on their teacher and coming through the Jewish community principally and I hope I'm not encouraging anybody's anti-semitism but I think that it resides there or has opportunity there beyond anything that we presently recognize there's something about that configuration of things in Jewish religious mentality that was expressed by that high priest that was necessary that one man die for the nation lest we lose our place we need to get a sense of this what what the what the crucifixion of death of Jesus registered upon their souls what they witnessed it was terrifying because all of them had said though all the world deny you yet will we deny you never and yet when the the night of terror came when Jesus was apprehended and the fact of it struck they all fled and they all betrayed him and some like Peter shamefully so if we're going to appreciate the statement peace be unto you and the confidence that Jesus is wanting to impart by him in the demonstration of himself as resurrected and now I send you as the father has sent me we need to begin with a clearer sense of what their fear is that eight days later they're still behind closed doors it's a fear that nobody in this room has ever yet experienced and some of us in this room will now what is the the anatomy of that fear what what it's the depth of depths it's the enemy poured out bearing his fangs it's seeing how ruthless and how devastating he can be as he ventilated all that is intrinsic to his darkness upon Jesus and left him shredded marred more than any man none of us can imagine where Jesus looked like in his death and one way that we can begin to sense it is the two on the road to Emmaus who were so disconsolate so dejected so broken because they had seen him hang in that pitiful condition that every last hope they had was shredded equally with the shredded Lord so can you know how many of us have ever faced the Jewish community head on how many of us have ever seen behind the facade of politeness and civility and moral and ethical value that the Jewish community endorses something of the antagonism against God that has opportunity there this maybe we'll get to this in another way at some other time but I believe this has everything to do with the historic failure of the church to go to the Jew first and also to the Greek the church has missed the priority of God because it intuitively recognizes just how monumental a threat and how formidable a presence the Jewish thing is they were they were behind closed doors for the fear of the Jews and one of my experiences was speaking at Vassar College in upstate New York and spending the day there and as I passed one of the Jewish students a number of Jews frequent that place this young fellow looked up and he said you'll get yours tonight I thought what does that mean but it wasn't long that I found out that that night as I was preaching on Abraham and circumcision the doors burst open and in came about a dozen black fedora-hatted bearded Orthodox Hasidim I'll tell you that the Mafia would look like Boy Scouts and next to the terror that came into that room and these guys burst in and not one sat they placed themselves strategically around the room and I never watched a congregation of Christians go berserk as I saw them that night it was like lifting the lid off a garbage can you can't imagine what came out fear anger resentment but before that if I had said how many of you here love the Jewish people every hand would have gone up but when the Jewish people came in in the depth of their religious antagonism to God and truth everything changed we were taken by surprise surprise and what we reveal when we're taken by surprise is what we in fact are and one of these guys stood about the distance from me as flora peering at me with burning eyes like I was Hitler himself and then they began to take over and how dare I come with the King James Bible in my ignorance and that that that that it was just an evening never to be forgotten I think I would in terms of stark terror I would say that that night exceeded the occasion at Jack what's his name's church in Los Angeles Heyford when the doors burst open again and a band of Jewish radicals like the JDL came walking down each aisle toward me and the guy that was walking down the center aisle had a knit cap and something under it which I thought surely was a vial of acid to be thrown in my face and I was preaching on act 16 and the apostolic encounter and was happening everyone stopped breathing and what saved the day was that a young brother whom I had just recently baptized a new convert a Hollywood writer too young in the Lord to know better he's about six four or six five got out of a seat and he grabbed this guy by the scruff of the neck and by the seat of his pants and just hoisted him right out of their own and I didn't object these are these are little which shall I say pre last days foreshadowings of the kinds of abrupt confrontations that are going to take place particularly in God's last days dealing with the Jewish people who are already so hyper and so sensitive and so defensive of their Jewishness in their insecurity that anything mediated toward them however well-meaning has got to be misunderstood and be misconstrued by them as threat we need to know that it's not going to be apparent to them that we have hearts full of love and desire their redemptive recognition of the Lord to them we represent a threat that is contrary to the thing they want most to preserve namely their very slight sense of Jewishness that is being attacked from every angle even the angle of intermarriage that is already now like 65% of all American Jewish marriages so we're a threat and there's something here that is not to be found in any ethnic group this is not your ordinary resistance to the gospel there's something here of an additional kind that is at the heart of the powers of darkness of this present world that has employed my people unhappily throughout their whole apostasy to be the agents even unwittingly of these powers to bring about schemes and devices contrary to God's intention like Marxism and all of the other kinds of things in which we Jews have been so expert have you noticed that the Lord does not encourage us to try it out in the sticks first and then if it works there you bring it into the big city and and put it up on Broadway he says begin at Jerusalem where I was crucified where the prophets were stoned then you can go to Samaria and the uttermost corners of the earth don't begin where it's easiest begin where it's hardest like right right from the beginning head on meet the issue don't don't delay face it in the authority that is mine by virtue of my obedience to the father unto death and resurrection all authority is given to me now that's what he says but when he's not visibly present can you still believe that and face the outraged Jewish community that has just crucified him and will crucify others who continue in the same truth that he exemplified I think that what we're missing is a sense of the scandal of the gospel the terrible offense of the gospel as as it is most revealed when it comes into confrontation with everything that men celebrate as wisdom as righteousness as religion as morality as ethics as culture which we Jews have developed and propounded to the farthest state the point of greatest antagonism in conflict is where the foolishness and the scandal of the gospel meets the wisdom of the world head-on and that's represented by the Jewish community that has just crucified that wisdom and now these who were the observers of that terror the ferocity of it the unveiled what sort of bestiality are now going to have to go into the same place and continue the work that he began the same messianic task as the father has sent me so send I you I can just hear them saying great you know like what else is new and you you pick up where I left off you you continue in the thing that eventuated in my crucifixion and of course what do we know that not one of these men survived and with the exception of John to die a natural death every single one of them suffered a violent death and if this is the commencement of the gospel dispensation the beginning of it the sending by the resurrected one what will be its conclusion in the last days and don't we again need therefore to fully appropriate the assurance and the peace that the Jesus gave or it has yet not stumbled on the antagonism that the gospel is to the world and maybe part of the reason is because our gospel is not that gospel it's not the gospel of the kingdom it does not threaten the status quo it does not unseat the security and the whole mindset and way of life of people who consider and receive it by making the decision but but maybe when it becomes this gospel again to radically unturn everything that a person to it to which a person has given himself then we're going to know and the reaction of violence against us so these this is good to begin to borrow in and understand what's represented in just these few verses let me finish this statement here I'll read it again it is appropriate to find then to find the disciples behind locked doors and fear not yet surmising the meaning of the empty tomb that they were assembled for fear of the Jews quote and unquote is perhaps a deeper intimation beyond the levels of human consciousness of the ultimate earthly power expressed religious and secular means that had just devastatingly brought to death their master and their Lord all that stands for authority and power of the present age politically and religiously had triumphed its visibility and impressiveness having all the marble so to speak continues it is indeed something to be feared for the powers of hell are resident in it and the church that fails still to see this cannot itself appropriate in full the resurrection mandate or power and must as time itself I think has corroborated turn easter into a chocolate bunny's spring event let me go over that last piece there if we don't understand the reason for their fear will not be able to appropriate the reason for their confidence and their peace and we will turn the resurrection event into a kind of cultural celebration which it has become this resurrection you see we're missing it at every point we don't know as we ought to know we don't understand and know God as we ought the gospel is a parody of what it was at the first and needs again to become the resurrection has only become a doctrine to which we subscribe as being correct the world has denigrated it and made it only a kind of easter sunday chocolate bunny egg rolling thing that's why we need to go back to the first we need to go back to the beginning and dig out this event here that's being described it's been lost and so it will not have the meaning for us that we that it that we need unless we can begin by properly beginning to assess the fear we haven't even begun to look at and Jesus breathed the spirit upon them receiving the holy spirit what would you rather receive the continuing physical and visible presence of the lord or the spirit that is given because he's going to be absent from us and on the basis of what he has breathed and on the basis of where he's spoken will that be sufficient for you to establish you in what the shalom of God is which is not just a shabbat night greeting but shalom in the moment when the doors burst open and the chassidim come in that that's when you test whether you're in the shalom of God anybody can have it when the candles are burning and we're having a little yiddish kite and a nice evening but the issue of our peace is in the midst of threat in the midst of terror will we then be at peace because the lord had said so and because he has breathed his spirit into us this is the way the whole gospel dispensation begins and this is the way therefore it is going to end it's always true that as also in the beginning so also in the end and that's why we need to get this beginning into our own spirits even to the place where it becomes for us a place of true beginning so that wherever we are spiritually behind closed doors fearful threatened intimidated subscribing to correct doctrines about resurrection and even speaking the word shalom yet thrilling for the reality of it we need to come through into something on the basis of this text these things are written that you might believe verse 31 now how come that's there exactly for this that you who's the you the lord anticipating the generations of believers that will follow even us now in this moment these things are written that you might believe that Jesus is the christ the son of God and that believing you might have life through his name that word life what what synonym would you put there for life what what is implied in life that you mean you have physical and biological continuation what's the life what's the life the life is what you exhibit when the hasidim are as close to you as flora and are spitting in your face and calling you every name in the book and your mind goes blank and you can't think of a clever thing to say to rebuke them what comes forth then has got to be the life of the lord how come art because it's not your reputation that's writing in that moment it's the eternal issue of their salvation who have come to harass to mock and to destroy nevertheless they're coming head to head with a piece of the resurrected christ in us and what he will say and exhibit in the power of that life may have a depth of penetration that only eternity will reveal you know i'm a man of very poor memory but here's one thing i remember about that night as this guy who was closest to me was railing at one point he said and we know that you love us cats but and then he went on to say something else but i i didn't hear the rest of it i thought to myself i never told you that how do you know that and i don't know where he got that we had never met before whether it's by reputation or something communicated i don't know but that you might have life by believing in his name let me let me just take a moment's breath right here do you realize that every single thing that we have been considering so far stands perilously in danger of becoming religion his name can become a formula resurrection can become a mindless doctrine to which we give assent shalom could become a cutesy little benediction everything that is charged here with such replete meaning as end time provision for us can if we miss it by ever so little become transmuted into religion so that in his name becomes a formula that if you rub the genie lamp in the name of Jesus something comes out we have got to contend for the faith saints once and for all given the saints and that's what we are presently doing and will do in all these days we are starting easy this is a light exercise nevertheless it contains all of the elements that will be with us in every time we sit down together to consider the things of God we need to realize that the world the flesh and the devil has a remarkable facility to transmute the holy things of God and turn them into religious pap so we have got to fight and go back in and get the original meaning and make it our own or we are goners when the doors burst open and the unexpected thing comes for which we are not fitted because we do not believe in the peace of God we do not believe in the name of God and have not appropriated the things that are made available through his resurrection are you following me that that's why we're we're probing here nothing is more viciously opposed to the faith than religion we all know and that's what terrified elijah and terrifies them when religion is threatened and we're going to hopefully get into this what is religion and why is it inimical to God one of the greatest ironies and paradox that that which purports to be about God is most opposed to God and opposed violently and ruthlessly you need to understand that and to recognize what religion is so whether it comes from jews what let me say this what we're calling jewish is probably also protestant denominational catholic all of the intrinsic elements that made up the judaism that crucified christ is yet to be found in all normative and conventional religious bodies today and that though we are presently in a quiescent mood where they are not expressing an antagonism to the apostolic faith it will not long remain that when the faith that is true begins to confront them you can expect there will be the mask off and the fangs bared and the same hostility again revealed so we're preparing ourselves for soon coming eventually that's a good point it's not when we say jewish we're getting at something much deeper and it's to be found in every religious and institutional thing that is opposed to true faith you might just make a little note for yourself and reflect on this and maybe write up a couple paragraphs what is the nature of religion and why is it antagonistic to God to the point of crucifying with devastating brutality the God whom it presumes to celebrate this is a this is not an option this is requirement unless you understand this the whole last days will be a mystery to you and you'll be unfitted not only to serve in the last days but to stand because one of the most vital aspects will be a last day's confrontation between religious and political system jezebel and ahab versus the elijah band the true prophetic faith so we need to understand what is there about the nature of religion by by its very nature that makes it so intrinsically opposed to God even in the name of God and if we had time and we had ability to begin to describe the horrendous assault on the sons and daughters of God through history the blood would rise to the ceilings that the roll call of martyrs of tortured victims it's not just people put to death put to death with spite with maliciousness with with delight in seeing them suffer there's something in the spirit of the of religion that is so inimical to God and to God's people that we need to understand which had just been abruptly demonstrated to these disciples when they saw it visited upon Jesus we need to understand their fear let's look into this into the text is he pushing them out from behind closed doors where does it show us that and a for the day for the first one who spots it peace be to you as the father sent me i also send you okay verse 21 this is in Jesus coming to give them a little pat on the back this is Jesus coming to send so sending receiving the holy spirit the word of peace every everything is set in these few verses so we need let's let's dwell on that for a bit as my father had sent me even so send by you why didn't he just say i'm sending you why does he even have to refer to as my father had sent me what what purpose does that serve if every word is of God what purpose does that word serve good so the sending is not a kind of a technical is not a kind of a technical ministerial thing but something that comes out of relationship and if the relationship is not there you're not being sent as he was sent nor will you have a comparable result as the father had sent me so send i you so the sending comes out of a relationship with the father with a knowledge of God or that sending is vain and what what question rises in your mind like if that's true art then what can we say about the preponderance of religious things that the church has been doing historically since that time and now even today how much of our acts and religious activity is out of ascending derived from relationship with the father and how many of us would not presume to go until that relationship is sure and don't think that by these few questions we're exhausting what is implied in this that as my father has sent me so send i you it's in the same character it's in keeping with his same purpose will be in the same power it comes out of the same relationship you're going to be a continuum of what i have expressed till now no small thing to men who are terrified and sitting behind locked doors and the whole destiny and future of the gospel endeavor rests on their ability to do it it or there's no continuation and no future how do you like them apples the faith of God in fact we can even make a little collection of the last comments of these men though the world denies you never and later on even peter saying what and what shall this man do and there's still a competition of striving and jealousy i mean God is taking some really crude material and charging them with the same commission that he himself had talk about the faith of God has anything changed since that time has the lord revised the strategy is there any work that can be considered God's work today that is significant and messianic apostolic that can be performed outside of this context maybe just to take a moment and talk about how ministerially minded we are particularly as westerners and as americans very little thought about relationship but everything about doing and having a ministry and what are you doing and what are you performing it's not the emphasis of the lord at all we need to be be restored to something that relationship precedes service and relationship of a very particular kind of the kind that the son had with the father i'll tell you that might call for like a moratorium on all present activity for a considerable time to let a relationship be established and in fact what has most most threatened that kind of relationship but the activity itself in fact the activity probably stands as a substitute for the relationship because it's tougher to be than it is to do God's doing always comes out of being of being be not afraid peace be unto you the emphasis is on being who can figure out why verse 23 is included in this text at all how did that get in there what does that got to do with what we're talking about it doesn't seem to be like a detour why why would sin now come into the discussion and that that those to whom he's speaking and breathing his spirit will have an authority to remit or to retain sins whose sins do you think is being met in this discussion whose sins do you think is being referred to here the jews is it the word you you
