Covenant Consciousness - Art Katz

I'm starting this morning by quoting from Karl Barth, B-A-R-T-H, a great Swiss-German
theologian, died about 1986, whose 13 or 14 volumes of Church Dogmatics is the summary
of his lifetime thought, and a great figure. And this is one of those volumes, and he speaks
of covenant out from creation. He goes back to the point of earliest beginning, that creation
and covenant are inextricably linked, that if God had no other reason to create but to
establish a format and a framework for the establishing of covenant, that would be sufficient
ground. Because the heart of covenant is, I will be your God, and you will be my people.
So there needs to be a necessity of people, and there needs to be a necessity of God who
can honor that promise. And in the declaration of this covenant, and its fulfillment, is
the revelation of God himself, as he in fact is. If you don't see God in covenant, you
don't see God. So, I'll quote, and we'll see where it leads us. It speaks of creation as
an incomparable act. We mustn't presume for the created order as if it's a matter of fact
and has necessarily to come. It's God's divine initiative. He had no need for it. It only
opened him to a whole assortment of problems and aggravations for which he could have been
spared, because he knew that with the advent of creation and of man, there would be fallenness,
there would be sin, transgression, and that his son himself would have to be the expiation
of that sin. And yet, he did not hesitate. So we need to respect the act of creation,
which is under fire now, in all of the fervor about intelligent design and evolution. The
modern world wants to deny God as creator. But we need to cleave to this foundational
concept, because everything issues from it. It's an act of God out of his own love and
out of his own initiative and makes possible covenant and all of the reality that follows.
Though he is wholly self-sufficient and absolutely glorious and blessed in his inner life, he did not
have such will to be alone. Covenant is relationship. Covenant is not a contract. I'll do this for you
and then you've got to do this for me. It's the establishing of a relationship and out of the
appreciation of the relationship and the love that it engenders, you keep the covenant. But
your keeping of it is not its condition. You're not being rewarded for your keeping. So it's
establishing a relationship between God and his people, in which he reveals himself as the faithful
God of promise. I will. This is the freedom of his love, an act of the overflowing of his inward
glory. It says of the world that it received through an act of God the reality, existence,
and form, which it did not have and could not therefore give itself, because it did not exist
at all. This is not creation out of an accident, some collision in the heavens and some haphazard
physiological thing with spectra. This is God's act. It's the absolute gift of God. It is his
good pleasure, free omnipotence of the divine love. The reality elected and posited by this
divine good pleasure, established and determined and limited by this omnipotence of his love. God
is love, and that love required creation, that he would not be alone, that there would be
relationship and fellowship with his creatures, and that that would be in a bond of covenant by
which he takes the initiative. Israel is only on the receiving side. The terms are stated by God.
He initiates covenant as he has initiated creation. We have only to accept it or to reject it. We know
that the rejection in the history of Israel has been costly and is costly to this day. It's a
slight against his love. So in the chapter on creation and covenant, he wants to make possible
the history of God's covenant with man, which has its beginning, its center, and its culmination in
Jesus Christ. The history of this covenant is as much the goal of creation as creation itself is
the beginning of history. So it's not an exaggeration to say God established creation in order to
establish covenant. If he went that far, how significant a phenomenon is covenant? How much
ought it to be esteemed if it required the whole bringing into being that which was not, and opening
to God all of the problems and weight of things that he need not have suffered if he continued
to choose to be alone. But the creation as the basis for covenant is the act of his love. It's
a first work. It's the covenant of grace before partnership in which he has predestined and
called man. Man had to be created to be the object of covenant and therefore to miss that
identification and to live in independence of that covenant and the God who calls men to it
is to live a fractured life, to be out of sorts, to be out of joint. This is the normative intention
of God, created man that he should be in covenant relationship with him with a great promise, I will
be your God, you will be my people. And at the end of the age, in Jeremiah 30, 31, this is exactly the
statement that is reiterated in the new covenant that is everlasting. Creation sets the stage for
the story of the covenant of grace. It has everything to do with the triune Godhead and the
agreement of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to God's enterprise with man in the world. So there's a
collaboration in heaven, so to speak, within the Godhead itself about the fact of creation and its
object, namely covenant with man and that the Son himself will one day have to come as the mediator
of that covenant and the bearer of the curse of the covenant. But knowing that God did not withhold,
nor did the Son, nor the Holy Spirit, so there's an agreement in the Godhead itself from the beginning
for creation and its purpose. We need to get back, you can't go back further than creation, but we
need to go back to it in a sense of appreciation and esteem or else it's dismissed as if it's a
fact of life that has come in and of itself. No, it's a chosen act of God with the intention of
blessing man and the ultimate blessing that I will be your God and you will be my people is that we
will be in union together and you will even share in my divinity and in my spirit and in my life.
And that will be the ultimate expression of the covenant blessedness for which you are intended.
Of course, Israel is the first nation selected, the first creation of God and therefore the first
work of his word was light and its separation from darkness. Only in its separation from light is
darkness also created and therefore the creature of God. The subject is natural light and natural
darkness. Natural darkness as that which declares the reality which was rejected by God and has
therefore vanished and natural light as that which proclaims the will of God opposed to it. It is
natural light as such which is the irresistible and irrevocable declaration of life. So he goes
back to creation and in the beginning God said let there be light and light came before the
establishment of the luminaries. That's the fourth act of God is the creation of the moon and the
stars which are just vehicles for the continuation of the expression of light but light is God and
that was invoked from the beginning. The first act of God, let there be light and light challenges
the darkness and it's in that light that we're called to live and walk and have our being and
even that the creation of light is an act of grace, is a covenantal blessing for man that we
should not wallow in darkness and have the light of life. The light that came upon Paul on the road
to Damascus was brighter than the noonday sun. It was the original light that came with the first
act of creation and in that light Paul caught a glimpse of the Lord whom he had formerly persecuted
and experienced a total revision of his understanding that made everything of the
past to be as death and dust. It blinded him and I'm fond of saying that anyone who has received
so superb an entree into the faith by which he became the chief apostle and to whom was given
the great revelation of the mysteries of God and the mystery of Israel and the church that we need
to dwell on that revelation and that man as the source for the church of the profoundest kind
for the last days because he began in a light greater than the light of the noonday sun.
It did not come by his speculation, by the operation of his own brilliant mind.
It came by a flash of light from heaven in which he saw such things as affected everything for his
apostolic and eternal future. So what issues from him from that light should be for us the most
commendable source of guidance for the last days. So Paul is suffering a kind of neglect
as if he's some kind of strange creature and has his own thoughts and
having no more credibility than others. He's foremost because to no other apostle
came such revelation, such apprehension on the road to Damascus as what he experienced.
It's a light that we could ask for ourselves although we may at first have to suffer a
blindness and languish for three days neither eating nor drinking as his life was reviewed
before him and he forsook all the things to which he had previously submitted as the leading student
of the Rabbi Gamaliel. Talk about conversion. The man was controverted. He was completely
turned inside out and his whole understanding. He saw in the face of Jesus the light
of the glory of God. One glimpse of that face and that light changes everything.
We can't do more than to ask some measure of a revelation of that kind.
Well I think we ought to look at the classicus locus which means the classic text on the subject
of covenant is the Abrahamic covenant. Every covenant from the Noah right through to the new
covenant is in some way an adumbration or development of what was initially given Abraham.
That's the centerpiece and in it are all the quintessential
constitutive factors of covenant. So in Genesis 15 we need to dwell on that giving
and see what it will teach us
because there also is an issue of darkness and of light. I'm reading from the Amplified.
After these things the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abram I'm your
shield your abundant compensation and your reward shall be exceedingly great. And Abram said Lord
God what can you give me since I'm going on from this world childless and he shall be the owner
and heir of my house is the steward Eliezer of Damascus. Abraham continued look you have given
me no child and a servant born in my house as my heir and behold the word of the Lord came to him
saying this man shall not be your heir but he who shall come from your own body shall be your heir.
So everything begins with God speaking, God taking the initiative, God the creator and so the Lord
said the word of the Lord came to Abraham, Abram in a vision fear not and then again in the fourth
verse the word of the Lord came to him saying this man shall not be your heir and he brought him
outside the tent into the starlight and said look now toward the heavens and count the stars if you
are able to number them then he said to him so shall your descendants be. Abraham believed and
trusted and relied on remained steadfast to the Lord and he counted it to him as righteousness
right standing with God and he said to him I'm the Lord who brought you out of all the coldies
to give you this land as an inheritance but Abraham said Lord God by what shall I know
that I shall inherit it and he said to him bring to me a heifer three years old, a sheep goat three
years old, a ram three years old, a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he brought him all these
and cut them down the middle into halves and laid each half opposite the other but the birds he did
not survive when the birds of praise whooped down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away when the
sun was setting a deep sleep overcame Abram and a horror a terror a shuddering fear of great darkness
assailed and oppressed him and God said to Abram know positively that your descendants will be
strangers dwelling as temporary residents in a land that is not theirs and will be slaves there
and they will be afflicted and oppressed for 400 years but I will bring judgment on that nation
whom they will serve and afterwards they shall come out with great possessions. So this text
is interspersed with the act of establishing covenant through pieces cut in half and then
references to Israel's future history it's a it's like a weave in a tapestry that we need to
graciously gently move through.
The fact that the sun went down and that Abraham was greatly afraid and a terror came over him
what do you suppose that designates why why would the establishment of the classic
covenant which will be the pattern the template of all covenants including the concluding
everlasting covenant invoke immediately a terror of fear of darkness birds falling on of prey falling
on the carcass there's a it's a this is a remarkable drama this almost needs a Wagnerian
musical backdrop to get the full drama of this this is not some light transaction
this is if the heavens themselves are pulsating and trembling because something
is being struck with the father of faith that will affect all subsequent generations
and the interesting thing is that Abraham himself does not pass through the pieces
in a covenant of the classic kind where the word brith the name brith means a cutting
as a word for covenant the two partners who are in agreement pass through the cut pieces
indicating that if either party fails they are making a bond unto death and they invoke upon
themselves the death that is symbolized or expressed by these cut animals and yet
God does not require Abraham to move through these pieces in fact as we learn he sleeps
through the occasion and God himself alone walks through the pieces and that's already
predictive of the everlasting covenant that I will make with you in those days and put my law
in your hearts and every man will know me from the least to the greatest as if this is all my baby
your your failure at covenant keeping is notorious but I'll establish a covenant
that will be everlasting because I who give it will also keep it and I'm symbolizing and
signifying that by walking through these pieces now but how can God himself then be a candidate
to suffer the death of a failed covenant the curse of a failed covenant what he's doing is
implicating his son who will come as the mediator of the covenant to bear its curse
and to fulfill the vengeance of the covenant by his own death and the shedding of his own blood
that's why Jesus said at the Passover table at the Last Supper this is my blood given
in the new covenant for you
so dwell on this text the details of it
so out of tune with our age
so in verse 17 when the sun had gone down and a thick darkness had come on
lo a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between those pieces and on the same day the
Lord made a covenant promise a pledge with Abram saying to your descendants I have given this land
from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites,
the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Jebusites
so we need to note that the very first establishment of the covenant is not some
airy and ethereal spiritual blessing although it is that but a concrete specific giving of land
the land is a covenant provision of God for Abraham and for his descendants but the heck
of it is they cannot possess that land except as being in covenant with God if you're out of
covenant your candidates for expulsion and that's the expulsion that we anticipate and must
necessarily come because in 1948 with the establishment of the state of Israel through
secular and socialist men there was not a fig of understanding about the land as a covenant provision
but they just assumed that out of the necessity of the holocaust and the need for homeland
and the political factors then operative that they could go in and begin to establish
that only God could give and what could only be kept in covenant bond but we mustn't assume
that because God works in history to enable a return of a sort that that is the fulfillment
of his covenant purposes rather it's to show Israel in its failure that it cannot succeed
independent of covenant relationship because in covenant relationship is the grace given
to be to the stranger what we ought who is in the land and the treatment of the Palestinian
is a clear indication that secular Israel was incapable of any relationship of that kind
in fact their treatment was so harsh and often so unjust that it exacerbated that people through
a frenzy that they think that their children's that their children being of living bonds is a
just a sacrifice there's a vehemence and a bitterness among the Palestinians for a history
of slight being uprooted being mistreated having their lands taken and misappropriated
and various other intimidating acts by which Israel sought to maintain a control
but could not be to the stranger in their midst what only a covenant grace would enable
it's one thing to be to your own but to be to the stranger gracious and kind
requires a grace from God and that grace is the expression of God given a covenant relationship
with him he has seen to it that you cannot succeed independent of that covenant and so
there's a short duration and maybe the intention of God is to indicate to Israel because what are
we Jews but supreme humanists that you cannot succeed independent of me you took a brave stab
at it you transform the malarial swamp land you established a high-tech civilization but in the
end you precipitated your own destruction and then now you will be cast out of the land
and in the and in your reject and in your being cast out you may consider and repent
and find that your God and turn to him and he'll restore you to covenant and to the land as a
covenant keeper so this is a drama of such proportions of course we desire a quick and easy
solution the state is established it's not doing too well but it will improve
but the issue of improvement is exactly the issue of humanism
improvement implies that by human thought and ability prowess man can succeed
in gradually altering his circumstance but what Israel has got to see is that
the best of our intentions will come back into our teeth and that we have been reaching
a humanly insoluble condition that without God we cannot remain in the land
so he's this is a circuitous long route of a momentary historic return
getting established in a way in which you think of the pity
that those great cities have to be tumbled and the great towers of Tel Aviv have to come down
and the great numbers of Ethiopian and Russian immigrants will be among the casualties of the
devastation of the last days but so is the great cost that when Jesus comes two-thirds of Israel
have already perished and the one-third must necessarily pass through the fire and be to him
a restored remnant so this this touches last night's conversation how far will God go
and what what is at stake here is God's provision of Israel for the nations that you're called to
be a nation of priests and a light unto the world you're not called to be a success in yourself
and to say look my no hands you're called to minister to the nations but only out of a
brokenness of a people who learn their own sin and and come to a place of contrition
and are able to come to their former enemies and bring the knowledge of the mercy of God
which they themselves have received after they have experienced his judgments
so there is a costly training for a priestly nation but there's no shortcut
and there's no shortcut for us and we we all we have a comparable
calling and a comparable requirement to know the Lord through dealings that we can minister the
reality of God not just as a correct doctrine but a reality tempered in our own life and experience
because that's what priesthood is the world is dying the world is in a substandard condition
for the want of Israel's presence among the nations as a priestly nation that's right you
need to know that the great profanation that is sweeping the world the ugliness of culture
the universality of its low taste is all a statement of the absence of a people called
to teach the nations the difference between the sacred and the profane but the heck of it is
that there's hardly a more profane people on the earth today than Israelis themselves
they are tattooed, pockmarked, engraved, earringed, stomach ringed, tongue ringed, nose ringed
cheek haired they're freaking out their youth their generation everything that God says that
you should not do they should not be tattooed they do they're into the worst aspects of culture
and even in America the leaders of the rap music industry are Jews the entertainment industry all
of the kinds of things that are degrading somehow have their emanation from us in our genius and
our ability to find profit in it so we're functioning exactly in an opposite way to
the divine intention and the world is paying the price I even have a secret theory about the root
of anti-semitism that it's an unconscious resentment on the part of the world of Israel's
failure to be to the nations what we want that somehow the world senses something wanting in
that failure and it issues in a resentment against that people and that will never be
met again until Israel fulfills its destiny but to go from its present condition to that
of a true priesthood will be through the road to Calvary and Isaiah 53 is not only the description
of the Lord's suffering it's a description of the suffering of the nation that will be marred more
than any man and that they will have no beauty that any should desire them when they are expelled
out from Israel and elsewhere in the nations and are hated and pursued they're going to experience
and measure what came upon the Lord himself and in that suffering there'll be a recognition a glimmer
oh for our transgressions he was stricken oh he went to the lamb as a slaughter silently we're
complaining and bellowing so what Israel has rejected because Isaiah 53 is not even included
in the Shabbat Haftorah readings the Shabbat prophetic readings it's eliminated of course
because it is so Christological that when I read it to my mother the first time she said where in
the New Testament are you reading she couldn't believe I was reading out of a classic Old
Testament text and so we have lost that text and lost its great meaning and as I said what we have
not received by the word we must receive in our experience so there's a road to Calvary ahead
for the nation and in that suffering as they pass through and have no beauty that any should desire
them will the church itself be tested Lord when did we see you naked thirsty hungry
will be the the question that will be before us most of the world will turn its back on this
suffering people and even gloat at their condition and say they deserve it they precipitated this
they were unruly they didn't care about world opinion it's liquid it has cost them tough on them
but there'll be a remnant people in the earth that will suffer them take them in wipe their blood
heal their wounds and we sang that this morning the spiritual Lord is now upon me to heal the
brokenhearted there's no way to begin to assess the depth of that brokenheartedness
because when it comes it will come suddenly and the Jews are living in a kind of
denial a dream world that even if you're in Tel Aviv and Gaza is steaming and rockets are going
off you are sufficiently insulated that you can have your coffee on the veranda of a coffee house
as if you're living in the best of all possible worlds but that world is going to come down and
come down suddenly and so the psychological shock of being uprooted and cast out of pursuit and
stripped will be the condition in which they will come to us and in which they need to be
comforted by the Holy Spirit but with what grace shall we meet them if we don't meet them
by the grace given us in covenant because they will be despicable they will be unclean
they will be stinking they will not have had access to showers that their clothes are running
on their back their sores are mollifying and fly infested they're in pathetic condition they have
no beauty that any should desire them how should we desire them except the grace of God
by our covenant relationship with him enables us to be to them what he himself is
so the issue of covenant is the critical factor in the consummation of the age for the church
toward Israel and that Israel itself might be saved through it and brought into that everlasting covenant
so on the same day in verse 18 the Lord made a covenant a promise a pledge it began by speaking
it ends by speaking the God who creates is the God who speaks his speaking is an event
and it's on that event of his word and promise that we ought to cast ourselves
Abraham cast himself on that although his body was as good as dead looking upon himself
himself he had no descendants he was near a hundred years old as was Sarah and God said look
at the stars in the sky so great will your your progeny be and he believed God despite
every appearance of the contrary God said he believed so this is our classic father of the faith
and the one with whom God makes the classic covenant that becomes the pattern of all subsequent
covenant and then 17 we have another visitation of the Lord when Abraham was 99 years old the
Lord appeared to him and said I am the almighty God walk and live habitually before me and be
perfect blameless wholehearted complete that's that's an invitation to be a son of a covenant
there's no way you're going to be that by human resolve God gives an ultimate like mount of
beatitude requirement be thou perfect and walk thou before me
only possible by someone with whom a covenant has been made
who can draw on the grace of God to be this with him and I will make my covenant
my solemn pledge between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly and Abraham fell on
his face and God said to him as for me behold my covenant is with you and you shall be the
father of many nations you didn't deserve this you didn't earn it there's nothing that you can
perform it is something I'm simply conferring and pronouncing it is
it's a covenant to be kept but the keeping of it is not the condition for its continuance
the keeping of it as I've said before is rather
the spontaneous and free loving response to the goodness of God
and inviting us into a relationship with him for that reason we want to keep it but it's not a
legal obligation that if we don't perform it we're out we have to understand that that would be a
contract that's the model for the world's contract these are the conditions of a legal kind but a
covenant is something transcendent a covenant is something that has come down from above
from God the creator out of himself of what he is in himself and some of the biblical commentators
even suggest though the texts do not give us any ground to presume it that the father and son and
holy spirit are themselves covenantally related the one catch is that in covenant it's a superior
addressing an inferior but in the Godhead there are no inferiors so that that thought kind of
suffers loss but we have to assume that God did not just pluck the concept of covenant out of the
air it emanated and issued out of what he is in himself and for that reason it needs to be more
affectionately held and observed and respected and obeyed obedience is a key
but it's not the obedience of a legal attitude it's the obedience of love grateful for the
benefit and the provision of this relationship with very God if your obedience issues from that
it's an acceptable obedience but there are few believers who have that kind of mentality
rather they are striving to assert rather than acting out of a love of gratitude
so i quite agree that the smoking pot of the blazing torch is symbolic of the crucifixion of
Jesus a statement well before the event but summing up the horror the pain the anguish
the utterness of that sacrifice which is a sacrifice unto death through fire as it were
that from the very beginning of the making of this everlasting covenant that is prefigured
and the Lord himself will in time perform it so the Lord speaks about the 400 years of slavery that
is yet future for the nation but you can say also that the oven and the torch not only presages the
sacrifice of Jesus but the holocaust of the Jew throughout its history there will be a suffering
there'll be a devastation more than once and yet a future time before the everything is consummated
so this is a remarkable symbolic ceremony act of God that's recorded for us here
i think the number has a significance
but it's equally an historic time because it gives the time for the iniquity of the Amorites
to be made full so that when Israel is delivered out from Egypt they begin the conquest of the
Canaanite land and bring judgment that is now on time for these pagan peoples
so that many purposes being served 400 i'm sure is significant four often designates the four
corners of the earth a hundred i don't know multiplied so let's look at this companion piece
in Genesis 17 in which God requires this in making my covenant between me and you
verse six is the verse five the promise of the father of multitudes many nations
which is reiterating the initial call of Abraham in Genesis 12 i'll make you exceedingly fruitful
i will make nations of you and kings shall come from you and i will establish my covenant between
me and you and your descendants after you throughout your generations for an everlasting
solemn pledge to be a God to you and to your posterity after you i have underlined and i
recommend it to you in verses six and seven the words i will i will i will you won't i will
this has nothing to do with your virtue your character your ability i will i will establish
this covenant and again in first aid another i will gift you into your posterity after you the
land in which you are a stranger and the land of Canaan for everlasting possession and i will be
their God God said to Abraham as for you you shall keep therefore my covenant you and your
descendants after you throughout their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between
me and you and your posterity after you every male among you shall be circumcised and you shall
circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token or sign of the covenant the promise of
pledge between me and you something is being registered by that act by which man acknowledges
his impotence and that the flesh that is being cut off as a statement that he will not
trust in flesh to succeed in any covenant promise or blessing but that the God of i will
will perform what he has spoken and that always to look upon yourself and see the sign of that
covenant in your circumcision is to be reminded that you should have no confidence in the flesh
and in Philippians Paul speaks of it and he says for we are the circumcision
who rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh so this is
given of God made very clear made explicit written into our flesh that we're not to trust in flesh
in any fulfillment of God's intention he will i will make my covenant between me and you
i will bless you i'll be God with you you shall be my sons and my daughters
verse 13 he that is born in your house he that is bought with your money must be circumcised
and my covenant shall be in your flesh for everlasting covenant and the male who is not
circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant
so what thinking of this strange requirement we should be so reduced in jewish understanding
that circumcision today is looked upon a hygienic provision
the whole spiritual significance is entirely lost to those who submit to it
and that's where God convinces us that we're uncircumcised in our hearts
and need to be restored to this sacred act which we acknowledge God has God
and ourselves capable of nothing now if this is true for Israel to what degree is it true for us
are we also the circumcised when Paul says we are the circumcision is he speaking about jewish
believers only he's speaking about the church we are the circumcision how can he say that
because we have been called into this continent and that the circumcision that we bear
is not one made with hands but the Jesus that was cut out from the land of the living
that when we're baptized into him we're circumcised with him we're cut off and out
from the land of the living and we're brought into this realm through baptism
having no confidence in the flesh well it's hard to think of any other place in the human anatomy
where a cutting could take place of this symbolic kind without doing a permanent
injury or threatening life and yet be a visible sign that you carry in your lifetime as a nation
as a people in fact it might well not be an exaggeration to say foreskin was given to be cut
off not to be retained and to retain it as an act of presumption and male prowess and
uh start uh you know that kind of the kind of thing that australians mostly
but a circumcised male is a humbled male
and we need so to be in jewish religion it's a rabbi called a mohel m-o-h-e-l
but most circumcisions take place in the hospital by the birthing
doctor ariel was circumcised in long island david was never circumcised he was born in denmark
and there there was a stigma against circumcision ingrid went blue in the face when i when i urged
david's circumcision because to her it was inflicting him with a sign that would
make him conspicuously a venereal uh a candidate or a bearer of venereal disease
she understood nothing in her gentile mind about the practice that for us jews are so instinctive
that we don't think twice about it but i deferred to her she went purple and to this day david is
not circumcised and i wonder to what degree we're suffering the problems with them that we are
because of that failure but here abraham himself does it he circumcises all the males of his
household and we know that when Israel subsequently under joshua crossed the jordan they came to the
hill of foreskins and they could not eat this the passover until they were all circumcised
so it may well be that they circumcised one another it doesn't say how or who or by what
means the same thing is true of water baptism it doesn't matter who officiates it's valid when you
go under that water you wouldn't want any clumsy butcher performing it you want a sensitive man
yeah if we have made water baptism a trite and superficial religious requirement and fallen
short of its deepest appropriation as the sign of the covenant as a circumcision made without hands
to what degree are we in the covenant to what degree are we cut off from the house of Israel
and it may well be that this is so widespread the superficiality of water baptism today
the infant sprinkling or even adult immersion does not necessarily guarantee
that appropriation unless we go into it with this understanding of this desire
to be cut off from the flesh and so maybe the substandard condition of the church
is largely to be found in the neglect of water baptism and the sign of the covenant
which it confers why because we've lost the whole sense of covenant and the meaning of these
practices and so we get dunked or we perform a religious obligation but we come up out of that
water unchanged and still live according to the flesh so that doesn't mean that you need to be
re-immersed but it does mean that you need to by faith appropriate what God says as
barry just read that and the other places in scripture took place in your baptism lord i did
not realize it then in fact i probably at that time would not even have intended it
but now i want the full measure of what that baptism represented i don't have to repeat the
act i'm asking by faith that you would confer that reality that i would be among the circumcised
having no confidence in the flesh but rejoicing in christ Jesus
when you're joined with God and covenant you are in the position to receive every grace
i will be with you is more than just a little flippant remark it means i will impart i will
extend i will give of those qualities of the divine kind without which you cannot be my people
so if we're languishing and struggling through circumstances it may well be because we're
seeking to find solution humanly or in the flesh and are not in the deep place of abiding
in covenant through circumcision and need to be freshly cut again because there's something about
the foreskin i don't know that i can prove this but i suspect that it will grow over again if if
it's allowed to and it's even favored and cultivated you might find that fleshly protuberance showing
itself so there needs to be a kind of frequency of cutting a frequency of renewal of covenant
a submitting to the cross and the death of baptism in any excess or evidence of the flesh
that wants again to express itself and have thought so we need to keep in that circumcised
place we are the circumcision is a remarkable statement and it needs to come into our
consciousness without embarrassment that the new creation implies that circumcision made without
hands so it says neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything because
he's countering the tendency among jenfa believers to be judaized that somehow their faith is
inadequate unless they take on aspects of the law which he sees that if you so much as condescend
to one aspect of the law you forfeit all grace so we have to understand the context in which
father is speaking in galatians he's not negating this baptism that we're referring to that's
implicit in that new creation but he is negating the jewish practice that gentiles were being
encouraged to adopt by judaizers as somehow completing their faith and recognizing that
any condescension to law negates all grace that's true for us as it was for them so circumcision is
a complete cutting away there's no prospect of picking up from the flesh to supplement
and to help us in tight situations and uh what shall i say you need to be a preacher
you need to be in a precarious place where you're tempted to fill in out of yourself or some proven
past text when you're faced with the terror of a new word and an untested word and a seemingly
hostile audience there's every the flesh is beckoned to depend upon itself and rely upon
its own ability rather than cast itself upon God so we preachers or others who are in precarious
place of faith are faced we face continually the issue of flesh versus spirit i'm facing it now
don't think that we had all this laid out i've got to write a book i don't know where to go
to the next line or the next statement trusting the lord for the unfolding and happy in hearing
what i am because how dare we speak of circumcision and having no confidence in the flesh
when we speak of it out of the flesh that would be a patent contradiction in terms
so of necessity the subject itself must be presented in its own context and that's why
the lord has got me in my feverish condition this morning i'm substandard and uh trusting
that there'll be no confidence in the flesh but you can't take up the subject out of any natural
ability that you have i'm going to mediate this truth i'll bring it forth and you you rest
i'm God between the pieces and i'll be your provision and not only here and now but in every
occasion i will be your God we need to have a heightened respect for the galatians the
corinthians all the gentiles that submitted to this word of baptism were not just getting wet
they were being cut off and out from the land of the living they were radically being separated
from the flesh from paganism from culture from ancestry and all of the remarkable idolatries
that prevailed in that time the act of water baptism was the deepest consecration for those
gentile believers it needs to be made that again what did Paul call those who wanted to cut the
flesh the judaizes is a word that he used that they were like mutilators so then what is the
testimony to Israel in a gentile believer desisting from a physical circumcision and receiving the one
made with our hands but that having been a fruitless branch and cut off is now grafted in
by this this water baptism and the life of the sap of the root flows through this branch in a new way
bearing fruit that moves Israel to jealousy that Israel now perceives in gentiles the fruit that
should have issued from its own life but being cut off from covenant they themselves are fruitless
but to see the distinctive fruit of covenant blessedness coming from gentiles who have not
been physically circumcised is a remarkable testimony to the depth and significance of that
which is not made with hands and we're still waiting the fulfillment of that great mystery
in the and the expression of that fruit
