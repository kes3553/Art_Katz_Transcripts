Jeremiah - Prophet to the Nations - Art Katz

A slight haemorrhaging that continues still. The Lord is ready to continue to draw more blood. So I just want to warn you and prepare you. It's my continuing subject this morning, and evidently necessary in the Lord's sight. So I want to pray again for the Word, that it comes to us not only as instruction, but as event, and that we will be changed by it. And for that, who is sufficient? If Paul had to say who is sufficient for these things, what shall we say? So we just thank you, precious God, for the glory of your Spirit and your Word, the Word which is sent, not the Word which is contrived, the Word which does not seek to please men, but to please God. Lord, be pleased this morning, and let your Spirit honor your Word, to penetrate our deepest heart, to give us a divine understanding, and to change us. And we'll thank you and praise you for our unspeakable privilege in Christ. In His holy name we pray. Amen. I'd like to introduce my interpreter this morning, Andrew Wiles. We picked him up some place along the way. It was one of those divine accidents, and the Lord has birthed a relationship, that He knows me so well that even if I forget myself, He can continue on.

I want to begin this morning in the Prophet Jeremiah, the first chapter, God's call to Him, where He says, I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations, which indeed is our prophetic task also as the Church, and like us, He too was reluctant for such a call, behold, I do not know how to speak, I'm a child, isn't that what we say, and indeed it's true, and the day that we don't say it and don't feel it, we come to some kind of religious confidence in ourselves, we are disqualified from being a mouth for His citizens, we always need to come in trembling, and recognize that we don't know how to speak, but He says that you shall speak all that I shall command you, do not be afraid of them, not so much the world as the believers, we're more easily intimidated by the Church than we are by the world, how will they receive us, will they applaud our ministry, will we find acceptance in their sight, don't look at their faces, and the Lord stretched out His hand in the ninth verse and touched His mouth, just as He touched Isaiah's, and I have put My words in your mouth, a prophet's words are never his own, see I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, not just the political and the secular kingdoms but the religious kingdoms as well, and indeed it's the most difficult kingdom of all to bring down, but down it must come, if the kingdom of heaven is to be established in the earth, so what is your commission, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, before you build and plant, notice the ratio, two to one, the destruction, the requirement for destruction, is twice as great as the requirement to build and to plant, and if you have no stomach or inclination for that, you're disqualified for the other, do you like to destroy, it's painful, and bloody, and it's an anguish, but it's a necessity, because this is an hour of restoration in the purposes of God, because this is an hour of restoration in the purposes of God, because this is an hour of restoration in the purposes of God, you say what do you mean by that brother, and I would like you to act the third chapter, the 21st verse, about the sending of Jesus whom the heavens must contain, until the period of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ancient times, if these are novel and new thoughts, I ask you to receive them by faith, if these are novel and new thoughts, I ask you to receive them by faith, if I could try to empty myself in order to inoculate you with what is in my mind, I would do it completely, but take my word, that this is an hour of restoration in God, that Jesus is pent up or contained in the heavens, that Jesus is pent up or contained in the heavens, he cannot be released for his return until the restoration of all things, spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets from the earliest times, this is a painful task, this is a painful task, because what has grown up in 2000 years because what has grown up in 2000 years is all kinds of human, institutional and traditional accretions is all kinds of human, institutional and traditional accretions human concretions that have been added we have become so habituated to them we think them normal we are so habituated to them we think them normal even sacrosanct and untouchable I don't want to name them I don't want to name them but I could make some suggestions they are issues that have exercised the Church through centuries and have become part of conventional religious practices they are issues that have exercised the Church through centuries they are issues that have become part of conventional religious practices and yet in my conviction they are holding back the return of the Lord yet in my conviction there is a profound sense in which we need to understand that we can hasten the day of the Lord's coming it is not a fixed chronological event that will happen irrespective of anything no, it is waiting on something the restoration of all things as God originally gave them in the beginning before man came with his taint and his traditions and his distortions and the first task of the prophet before he builds and he plants is to root up and to pluck out and to destroy if you have no stomach for that if you are too squeamish if you want a ministry that is acceptable to men where you are not offended forget that you have a prophetic calling this is the prophet's first task Samuel exemplified it in yesterday's text do you remember how Saul wanted Samuel to pray with him before the people? yes, he said, I have sinned against the Lord but now let's forget about that come now and stand with me before the people it was a cheap and shallow kind of forgiveness it was a cheap and shallow kind of forgiveness no real sense of contrition before God it was just a kind of polite use of the word forgive without a genuine and appropriate repentance and the prophet would not lend himself to that kind of religious business and we should not lend ourselves either because if the church itself is not authentic if it does not itself stand for the truth if it compromises on the essential and profound things what shall we hope for in the world? he turned away he turned away and the king grabbed his garment and it rent we spoke last night of how the prophet saw this as a symbolic statement from God the Lord hath rent the kingdom from thee this day and still he pleaded with him that he would come and stand before him with the people and Samuel did so and then we read in 1 Samuel 15.32 bring you hither to me, Agag, the king of the Amalekites Samuel says, bring me Agag, king of the Amalekites and Agag came to him delicately, it says in the King James Version and Agag went to him in the English Version, he said delicately and it says in a joyful mood I think even the interpreters cannot bring themselves to the totality of God's Word one of my favorite texts is about the Ethiopian eunuch and I preached it once in Denmark without any effect at all and I could not understand it it's a powerful word until someone told me that they do not use the word eunuch in Denmark it's too distasteful it's too suggestive so they used the word servant or something of that kind and therefore they robbed from God the power of his own word they substitute politeness with truth and it may be the same point in the French edition but I like the English word, he came delicately and I picture him with mincing steps as walking on eggshells after all he's the ancestral enemy of the Israel of God the persecutor of the Church throughout the ages fearfully opposed to all that is of the Spirit the symbol of worldly eminence title, prestige, wealth, position, flattery, honor standing before the prophet of God who is the antithesis of all these things and he said surely the bitterness of death is past let bygones be bygones forget that I have persecuted the Church and tied the Anabaptists back to back and tossed them into rivers to die and took the apostolic Church in every generation and burned it at the stake and let its giants rot in prisons show the death of the bitterness is past let's make up this is an ecumenical age that's cheap ecumenicism and false and the prophet of God will not tolerate it Samuel said as thy sword has made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and Samuel hewed agag and pieces before them and Samuel hewed agag and pieces before the Lord in Gilgal pluck up, root out and destroy it's a bloody business it's an uncompromising severity it will not tolerate a lie it is utterly destructive and it's the first function of the prophet the axe must be laid to the root there's something that's required from us that is unsparing spare not and utterly destroy but Saul could not bring himself to slay Agag though he's the symbol of the ancestral enemy of Israel maybe there's some kind of unspoken affinity between kings maybe there's some kind of deeper psychological thing than that if I spare you now perhaps the day will come when you'll spare me because I too am a man of compromise and I want to avoid also the extreme severity of God so if I don't push you, don't you push me can you sense how this kind of leaven is working in the church today?

I remember the first time that God broke this upon my conscience I had one of my rare Sunday mornings off and the Jewish brother said, come to my church, I want you to hear my pastor a spirit-filled man!

I thought, wow, what a treat to sit at the feet of another and to hear God's word I could not have been more disappointed I sat up there in the great balcony of the church and I listened to these words coming forth and they were everyone correct it was a message about the Spirit of God and yet inside every alarm in me was going off my ears said that it's acceptable and correct but my spirit was recoiling and then the Lord showed me the problem the words were correct but the spirit of the speaking was a lie the words were radical but the spirit was saying that it was a lie the words were radical but the spirit was saying, don't take me seriously now don't you out there become alarmed I'm not expecting you to do this this is just a sermon remember it's my Sunday requirement so just lean back, just enjoy as a sermon you don't push me, I won't push you you seek to my sustenance and my parsonage in home the other benefits that come to me is being your pastor and I'll think that you'll have your nice Sunday services and you'll get a good biblical word every week but don't be alarmed I'm not expecting you to do this but don't be alarmed I'm not requiring anything against that spirit God says, hew it to pieces it cannot be spared utterly destroy and spare not and we're so hesitated the prophet did not and he says that he hew it to pieces before God there are other episodes in scripture of that kind and they almost invariably involve prophets you remember Elijah and the false prophets of Baal he said, bring them here he said, bring them here he said, bring them here Elijah and the false prophets of Baal he said, bring them here to me and he hew them to pieces by the river 450 of them it's an extraordinary physical feat for which the Lord gave him and a special anointing you say brother, this offends my sense of God you say brother, this offends my sense of God God is a God of love he would never do these things he would never require these things God is kind you know the great line in Hamlet when the prince dealt with his own mother he came home from school to find that his father who was a giant and a hyperion and a saint had been murdered by his uncle and that his mother had married the lustful beast that had slain her husband and that his mother had married the lustful beast that had slain her husband and that his mother had married the lustful beast Shakespeare says through Hamlet's mouth that she was lying with him between incestuous sheets and in Shakespeare she says that she was lying with him in incestuous sheets where are the Shakespeare's of the body of Christ who can speak words like that and in this great scene of confrontation for confrontation there must be if there is to be truth he takes his mother's locket and opens it and pushes it in her face on one side was the husband who was a giant, the man of stature and on the other side this lustful beast and she was now married and he pushes this in her face and she cries out Hamlet no more no more and he says one must be cruel in order to be kind and he says one must be cruel in order to be kind secular men can understand that and we who are called to be the prophets of God cannot and we who are called to be the prophets of God cannot utterly destroy and spare not and he hit him to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal Gilgal itself is a significant place it's the place where Israel was circumcised when they entered into the promised land because they had grown up in 40 years in the wilderness and unlike their fathers had never been submitted to the knife of cutting and the first requirement of the army of God as it came into the land of promise before any of the prophets before any Jericho could be taken was make thyself sharp knives and circumcise the children of Israel a second time there's a cutting that's required but we shrink from the blood we want a religion that comforts we don't want that cuts and the world dies and drowns in its own blood because there's not a church that can call it to righteousness that can confront it with the issues of truth because it has spared itself because it has entered into false relationships and ecumenicism because it has no compelling voice and no authority because it has not obeyed the Lord in the totality and the severity which he requires so I want you to look in the book of Exodus so I want you to look in the book of Exodus so I want you to look in the book of Exodus another episode of cutting in the 32nd chapter a story of cutting, chapter 32 that comes with the prophet Moses who came down from the mount with the tablets of the law to find the people of God in their charismatic dance around the golden calf of their own making eating, drinking and rising up to play because they were impatient and they could not wait for the authentic thing to come down from the mount given of God and so he confronted them in his prophetic power his authority and ground their calf to powder and made them to drink of it and no one said by what authority do you do these things the authority was evident it was the prophetic authority given to men who obey God in absoluteness and will not retreat from his severity that even smashes the tablets of God at the foot of the mount then they should cast pearls before swine it will not compromise it will not bargain and make arrangements the holiness of God the glory of God a single-eyed determination and insistence is the heart of the prophetic nature and in the 26th verse of this chapter we read Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's side let him come unto me how these prophets speak equating the Lord's side with themselves Elijah was the same you shall not reign nor do but according to my word this is either colossal egotism or these prophets have come to some transcendent place that we have not yet attained or these prophets have come to some transcendent place that we have not yet attained or these prophets have come to some transcendent place that we have not yet attained by which you cannot tell where the prophet ends and where God begins for they are one who is on the Lord's side it shall not reign nor do but according to my word it shall not reign nor do but according to my word you find this offensive you think that it lacks in humility or are we victims of the world's definition of that word and know not the humility and the meekness of God and know not the humility and the meekness of God for Moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth and not one of these self-defacing and not one of these self-defacing I'm not accustomed to public speaking, don't call on me initiation initiation but in the moment that God requires now thus saith the Lord God of Israel in verse 27 and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man, his brother, every man, his companion and every man, his neighbour not thus saith Moses thus saith the Lord God of Israel not thus saith Moses thus saith the Lord God of Israel it's one thing to slay Amalekites camel sheep oxen and ass but let every man slay his brother every man his companion every man his neighbour you know what I've done in my Bible? I've put the word man in a box it doesn't come in French in English it's said that every man slay his brother every man slay his friend, every man his father and I've put the word in my Bible every man are you a man of God? it's more than just knowing if you wear pants I said to Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God the Pharaoh said of Joseph can we find another like this? a man in whom the Spirit of God is God is waiting on men and I think the key to our being it the key to our priestliness that must precede our prophetic calling for Jesus was prophet, priest and king and between the authority of king and the calling of prophet stands the necessary priestliness of men who are consecrated to God who have put the sword on their side and have gone in and slain every man his brother his companion, his neighbor and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and there fell of the people that day about 3000 men Moses said consecrate yourselves today to the Lord Moses said consecrate yourselves today to the Lord Moses said consecrate yourselves today to the Lord each to the price of his son or brother so that they may bless you today it's called consecration it's not the kind that we ourselves would conduct our idea would be to call up a French caterer because our idea would be to call up a traitor and bring out a seven or eight course meal with an appropriate musical ensemble with an appropriate musical ensemble then we would have several religious dignitaries on the platform a little inflated and pompous a little inflated and pompous with their five bedded capper keys on their chain across their vests with their five bedded capper keys on their chain across their vests with their chain hanging on their jackets and then we would invite Dr. So-and-so and the other doctor who is the president of the Pentecostal movement to address us and then we would award the diplomas to the candidates and then we would award the diplomas to the candidates and we would call that day consecration and we would call that day consecration God's way is otherwise Who is on the Lord's side? Put your sword on and slay Every man, his brother, his companion, his neighbor, and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses Notice the conjunction Thus saith the Lord God of Israel and they did according to the word of Moses How many of us would have been so instant in our obedience when the issue of blood is required? We would have questioned the authority of the man We would have accused him of deception and heresy We would have given voluminous scriptural arguments of why it is that God could never require this and we would have faced him with a whole volume of scriptural arguments to prove to him that God cannot demand such a thing but they did according to the word of Moses but they did according to the word of Moses which was also the word of the Lord Children, is there something growing up in your heart? Even in our short time together of the kind of foundation for which our church is wanting an authority that is wanting that must come through men who are not the presidents of congregations and movements with their doctorate degrees but are appointed and called of God whose mouths are touched of God whose words are given by God who receive an authority from God that the people might do according to the word of the Lord that comes to them through Moses and until we shall come to that there shall not be glory in the church there's a little marginal note about what the word consecration means in my Bible Fill your hands with blood Anything less than this is not the consecration of God Have you ever drawn blood in the Lord's service?

Have you ever taken out a glittering sword? Have you ever taken out a glittering sword? Have you ever taken out a glittering sword?

and swung it without mercy in the severity of God not looking at their faces not listening to their cries and their moans their sentimental pleas the accusations of cruelty and lovelessness which I have heard countless times ascribed to me You lack love brother How could you do this?

How could you say this? Where's your love?

And many of us will shrivel at such accusations Even less than that is sufficient for us to wither up Even less than that is sufficient for us to wither up and to recoil and to withdraw not so the prophet There must be an unsparing obedience to God There must be an unsparing obedience to God who does not know mercy If God called the sons of Levi to go in and slay their father, their brother, their companion, their neighbor If God could call the sons of Levi to go in and slay their brother, their father, their friend, their neighbor How then shall we hesitate about the traditions of men?

So, how can we hesitate about the traditions of men? and the institutional practices that have grown up in our religious life and all the institutional practices that have grown up in our religious life Can we not be equally as ruthless with them? Can we not be equally as ruthless with them? Can we not be equally as ruthless with them?

And until we will be and until we will be He is going to be contained in the heavens He is going to be contained in the heavens waiting the restoration of all things that were spoken by the holy prophets that were spoken by the holy prophets since the beginning There is a consecration that is waiting for us as the prophets of God There is a consecration that is waiting for us as the prophets of God It's a priestliness that precedes our prophetic function It's a priestliness that precedes our prophetic function A total obedience to God before a consideration to men A total obedience to God before considering men And if our hands have not been filled with that blood And if our hands have not been filled with that blood We have been denied the blessing that came to them in that day We have been denied the blessing that came to them in that day And have no authority to bless others either And we have no authority to bless others either For the prerogative to bless men is exclusively a priestly prerogative Because the prerogative of blessing men is essentially and fundamentally a prerogative of preaching And it has declined along with everything else in our religious generation And it has declined along with everything else in our religious generation The meaning of faith The meaning of truth The sense of holiness The fear of God All in a pitiful state of decline All in a pitiful state of decline Even while the false prophets are telling us that this is our age of charismatic renewal Even while the false prophets are telling us that this is our age of charismatic renewal Where is the fear of the Lord?

Where is the fear of the Lord?

In the most man-pleasing institution on the face of the earth In the institution that on the face of the earth tries to please men the most The most monotonous and the most predictable The most monotonous and the most predictable If we are not sure what the world is going to do tomorrow If we are not sure what the world is going to do tomorrow We can certainly be assured what the church is going to do Sunday We can certainly be assured what the church is going to do Sunday Utterly predictable Wanting in the creativity of God And the moving of God's spirit And the moving of God's spirit That attends those who are obedient That attends those who are obedient To do the word of the Lord To do the word of the Lord I would now like you to return to chapter 9 of Leviticus I would now like you to return to chapter 9 of Leviticus Which is the first description of the ordination or the consecration of priests Which is the first description of the consecration of the ordination of the priests and sacrilegi It is a chapter full of blood It is a chapter full of blood And it is painful even to read it When you reach the end You are wondering whether you are reading about priests Or you are reading about butchers From fingertip to elbow they are steeped in blood and grove From the tip of the finger to the elbow they are plunged into the blood It wrecks all of our fanciful and romantic notions of what priesthood is And it breaks all of our romantic notions of what the priesthood is Indeed, such notions need to be wrecked Need to be destroyed Because that is what has corrupted us The subtlety of a humanism That has come even into the church In which we project upon God our image And our definitions It needs to be utterly destroyed and spared not It needs to be absolutely destroyed and spared not What is performed in this chapter is given as commandment of the Lord through Moses What is told and explained in this chapter was the fruit of an order of God by Moses You notice how frequent if not invariable it is That it is the prophetic voice that leads the church You notice how frequent if not invariable it is That it is the prophetic voice that leads the church I am very interested in a thesis Which came to me recently A thesis of a brother in America Who himself is a prophetic person And yet he is called the pastor of the church And his thesis is this God gave to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers And the one who is given as pastor or overseer or shepherd Is not himself a leader He has not this kind of single-eyed ruthless devotion to God He can't draw blood He always wants to make nice and comfort And counsel and confer and teach Which is a valuable function And indeed someone needs to come after the prophets To patch up and to heal God's people To patch up and to heal God's people To patch up and to heal God's people But his thesis is that God did not call the pastor-teacher to be the leader But his thesis is that God did not call the pastor to be the leader But the shepherd and the overseer But that the real leadership of the church Even in its individual congregations Even in its individual congregations Comes from its foundational men Its apostles and prophets Who will not be distracted from the single purpose of God By the softer considerations of comforting men No wonder that our churches are predictable Monotonous The same everywhere Having programs And missing the uniqueness of God's leading No wonder that some of you are hearing for the first time the very concept of restoration No wonder that some of you are hearing for the first time the very concept of restoration You should have been teething on it from your earliest spiritual infancy You should have been teething on it from your earliest spiritual infancy You should have been teething on it from your earliest spiritual infancy But you had not prophets to proclaim it To see it And apostles to perform it Everything has been the pastor So if you do not come out with anything else in these days but this Pray for the restoration of all things And among the first of these The restoration of prophets and apostles to the body of Christ Men who are not time servers or game sayers Not religious politicians And inflated statesmen with chains across their vests Single-eyed fanatics Who insist on the glory of God And will never lend themselves to compromise Or a false ecumenism That will swell the numbers of the church And give an inflated appearance of things And give an inflated appearance of things Which are not true Men who will lead And that we might receive the word of the Lord again As it comes to us through a Moses Through a Jeremiah Or whosoever The sixth verse, this is the thing which the Lord commands The sixth verse, this is the thing which the Lord commanded that you should do And the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you Moses said Moses said This is the thing the Lord has commanded you You would never have imagined it for yourself Not in a thousand thousand years Because it is entirely offensive to your flesh Which recoils at the sight of blood And you would have established something far more polite Something far more religiously acceptable But it would not have been my consecration Because if you're going to be a priest A prophet King And assert my authority in the earth And be the bearers of my uncompromising words You need to know that there's a cutting There's a bleeding There's a death If there's going to be a life This is at the foundation of the church And you need to be so steeped in it It needs to get under your fingernails That you cannot forget it And this is the key to glory How mind-boggling this is If the glory of the Lord shall appear to you This is the thing which the Lord commanded What is the thing? And the eighth verse, he slew the calf of the sin offering And he dipped his finger in the blood And he poured it out on the base of the altar Verse 12, he slew the burnt offering And his sons presented unto him the blood Which he sprinkled round the altar Verse 15 And he slew it It wasn't done for him The priest himself must perform it He needs to have his face rubbed into the issue of death and life It's something that is not performed for him but by him That's what Moses said That's what Moses said Consecrate yourselves to the Lord You do this And if you're unwilling If this is too offensive If it contradicts your sensibilities You're disqualified This is the commandment of the Lord And it's unavoidable So he slew And he slew And he slew For my house shall be a house of sacrifice If it's to be a house of glory Not a house of convenience Or one hour, two hour Sunday services And a few francs in the collection plate My house shall be a house of sacrifice And if the priest don't know it And have not performed it What shall we expect of the people For as the priest So also the people The final humiliation is what is called the wave offering The wave offering in verse 21 I want to assure you that these are not Jewish practices We Jews have no special affinity for blood And indeed, modern rabbis are embarrassed by these references They dismiss this as primitive Judaism That has been replaced by higher forms As Judaism has evolved And with more and more and more And we have come away from this barbarous practice of sacrifice Now we do good deeds And we fast on the day of atonement And our religion is much more refined And acceptable And powerless How many of our churches are synagogues? For exactly this reason We are unwilling to draw blood Unwilling to cut Unwilling to sacrifice Unwilling to be confronted Or to confront We say we love the truth But we are not willing to suffer for it We are not willing to die for it We are afraid of being offended Or becoming an offense And our religion is powerless And we have no prophetic voice for the nations I am really amazed at the direction that God is taking I assure you, I did not plan it I am learning even as I speak And the Lord is driving something into my own heart and understanding Something for which I need to be reminded myself after 18 years And I am not afraid of being offended For there is a dullness that has come to my own sword A subtlety of compromise in my own spirit A man who was once fearless And relentless for the truth But something happens Over the course of time It is inadvertent We breathe the world's air And something comes into your spirit To dull you And now I am receiving new kind of compliments You are much more gentle art than you used to be You are really more loving Kinder And I am worried And I am concerned I do not want to lose the sharp edge of God Which I believe in my deepest heart I do not want to lose the sharp edge of God Which I believe in my deepest heart Which I believe in my deepest heart Is God's very love It is God's very love And if we are unwilling to be the instruments of His divine severity And if we are unwilling to be the instruments of His divine severity Do you think we shall be the instruments of His divine mercy His mercy is unknown to us And we are wallowing in a cheap grace Because we have been unwilling for His judgment Because we have not accepted His judgment We cannot have the one without the other No mercy without cutting There is no mercy without cutting God's divine severity is His love And we have substituted a sentimental mishmash To placate men And we have no voice to the nation And we have no duty to the nations Can you picture Aaron F that he slew and he slew and he slew
