The Cosmic Conflict - Art Katz

Good morning dear saints Well, we have prayed for you this morning already That the Lord would give you new stamina the ability to bear and take in fresh input because this morning's subject is Absolutely essential and critical for the formation of the church That is the church in an area of profound neglect almost a studied indifference and an unwillingness to consider the whole realm of invisible spirit reality that prevails over the nations and Someone has wisely said that the church that continues in that ignorance Labors in vain it fights at the air Pointlessly if it does not take into its deepest consideration the ultimate foundation of the reality of the conflict between the realm of spirit entities and the principalities and powers of the air contending for actual control and influence over the God's creation the church that is ignorant of That conflict cannot discern it and is not able to participate in the defeat of those powers is If so facto not the church The Western mentality is empirical Scientific pragmatic it needs to see and touch but the invisible realm of spirit is frightening Because we were told by Paul had the powers of the air known they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory My people were in active conspiracy for his death The Romans were the instrumentality of it but the actual effect the reality Came through the principalities and the powers of the air or had they known they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory So we're not talking about some ambiguous and a vapor of No consequence we're talking about an invisible realm that influences and affects things and nations and in the earth You cannot understand Genocide Rwanda fierce intertribal Rivalries, it's not just black against white. It's black against black rage and fury hatred chaos devastation death are all of the Effects of the character of the principalities and powers of the air whose ruler Satan Manifest himself in that that way and did so at the cross upon the Son of Glory the death of Jesus was a horror and a brutality and the handy work and the complete expression of the nature and the character of The evil one into whose hands the Lord had given himself in death. This is apostolic seeing Everything is predicated upon our ability to embrace not a Western view, but a cosmic view that is apostolic and Gods of a conflict that is ultimate and requires the church of an ultimate kind to consummate and conclude it So let's continue in Ephesians chapter 3 in coming to that Remarkable statement where Paul is just about to reveal to us The great mystery of which he has been which of which he is Stuart and the grounds for which he's given That's to which you're being less than the least of all saints To make all men see in chapter 3 of verse 9.

What is the fellowship of the mystery?

I don't know how your scripture reads you may have another word than fellowship I think in some versions it says the Administration of the mystery which I like better fellowship doesn't quite get at it He's not giving us an exposition of a mystery that we might be clever at the coffee table and Pontificate over the subject is giving us a mystery that requires a fulfillment That's why he's expounding it and that the fulfillment is exclusively through the church What is the administration of the mystery the fulfillment which from the beginning of the world has been hidden God Who created all things by Christ Jesus to the intent verse 10 that now? Here's where we here's where we have to pause dear Saints Here's where we're guilty if we rush headlong and don't savor every syllable of what is being spoken Paul is about to tell us as the great apostle that he is What is the intent and purpose of God for creation itself? We ought to be holding our hearts and stopping our mouths and and suspending our breathing We are about to learn.

What is the reason for creation? What did you think it was an accident?

It has issued out of God who is a God who is a Proposive God he's a God of purpose.

It doesn't create just to say look man.

No hands He creates with an intention and we're going to learn now what that intention is and when you learn it You're going to be staggered. It'll be the last thing that you would have ever expected Paul tells us quite clearly to the intent that now Unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places Might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. Oh you dear Saints Lord give us grace To dwell on every word that has been given by the Holy Spirit in This text for the edification of the church of all generations and especially the last What is Paul saying? That the purpose of creation Is that through the church? That the church would have a platform in the earth to perform something of an ultimate kind That has to do not with the desires of men or the benefits of men or even ostensibly the world itself but some invisible realm of Spirit power called principalities and powers of the air that to them might be made a demonstration Through the church of the manifold wisdom of God Whatever that means dear Saints we have got to learn it or it is the purpose for our being It's the purpose for creation But it doesn't what it has nothing practically to do for us or with us But entirely the satisfaction of God That a demonstration must be made that's important to him without giving us an explanation You require explanation for obedience Does he have to tell you why? something is being stated here of An ultimate kind that is foundational to the church that is to be called apostolic It's a conflict of a consummate kind of an ultimate kind Against an ultimate enemy Called the realm of principalities and the powers of the air who? Occupy a stratum Over the nations and affect the nations by that presence Why do the heathen rage and? The Kings and the rulers take thought against the Lord and against his anointed to break their bands asunder Where am I quoting? so I'm true The Kings and the rulers take thought against the Lord and against his anointed What is God being redundant here the Kings and the rulers?

What does it mean the Kings and the Kings?

Or is it referring to two different spheres of authority and rulership the Kings are the earthly magistrates, but the rulers are the Invisible principalities and powers of the air that influence and express their will through them who employ Hitler and Dictators and and The fellow in Iraq and the fellow in North Korea and all of these scum are Manipulated jerked and influenced by the power of these principalities over their localities you cannot understand the phenomenon of Nazism and the systematic annihilation of six million Jews from the land of Luther and of the Reformation Except you factor in The influence of this invisible spirit realm How are they to be defeated? by a demonstration of The manifold wisdom of God whatever that is through whom? through the church Not through individual virtuosos But through the church in its composite corporate authenticity reality and life Something that can only issue from a church that is the church and defeat these powers and that this is the whole cosmic Context For which the church has been established in creation This is the context in which we are living our life and serving the purposes of God And we have only thought of evil spirits in terms of individual deliverance Think that that somehow handles the subject. Well, the enemy will give you any number of opportunities Individual deliverance so long as you leave untouched this realm of consideration Understand what I'm saying. There's a deeper consideration and the issue of individuals who are them demonically possessed It's a conflict with a whole realm of a fallen Angiology the fall of of Satan who took one-third of the angels with him in rebellion against God This angelic structure was created by God for governmental purposes To influence and to dispose men God would but in their rebellion they turned men away from God And turned them to themselves and have become the Gods of this present world Therefore we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities and powers of the air the world rulers of this darkness So are you wrestling or you're much too polite your Chinese to Chinese? Wrestling is grim Wrestling is eyeball to eyeball fingertip to fingertip Wrestling is all your strength all your will the grit the issue of who succeeds and wins in Wrestling is not necessarily who is the physically strongest? But who has the greatest determination who will not consider defeat? Cannot consider defeat whatever it takes to triumph. That's what they'll give It's an issue of character Wrestling is an ultimate statement and Paul says we wrestle not an individual combat a Corporate struggle and requires the church to come in To its true character as the church. In fact, nothing else will provoke us to come coming in To the character of church in its corporate reality More so than the recognition of this conflict might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God I wish there was an asterisk and a footnote that Paul would explain further With the manifold wisdom of God is that we're required to demonstrate that no single individual saint alone and Can demonstrate it can only issue out of the corporate life of the church? Because the manifold wisdom of God is what God himself is in his own nature It's not wisdom in the sense of Confusion Principles, it's the nature of God. It's what he is in himself who celebrates weakness and humility and Demonstrated that the cross the great magnanimity of God in forgiving those who oppressed him unto death The cross was a collision between two wisdoms The wisdom of the evil powers that is predicated upon force violence threat intimidation fear seduction appeal to ambition lust power That's what moves the world As against to God whose wisdom is humility weakness submission love patient forbearance forgiveness two wisdom systems collided at the cross and wrecked the Son of Glory But we read in Colossians that at the cross Jesus made of the principalities and powers and open spoil and disarmed them that his wisdom triumphed at the cross and That's why had they known they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory Because in the infliction of their power It gave God the opportunity to reveal the greater wisdom and to triumph by it And the accident that my sleep last night was one of the worst and that today I'm the weakest or is it perfectly appropriate that the subject itself must come forth in the Character of God. That's why Paul celebrated his infirmities and his weaknesses That God might be glorified and his strength may be made perfect in my weakness. That's another wisdom you dear saints The wisdom of this world is force intimidation threat manipulation and Any time that we ourselves? yield to that wisdom we are on the devil's ground and Unfortunately in our modern evangelical Christianity. We are often on that ground reputation mailings hype even manipulation and services I'm so Concerned even for the use of music That it should be conducive to altar calls How many times I have to stop the musicians and tell them God doesn't need your background music in order to facilitate The response of saints to his word his word is sufficient in itself and the use of music is manipulative And we have left God's wisdom and we have adopted another If this were not enough verse 11 punctuates the whole significance That all of this is according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord This is not some adjunct This is not some tangent This is the principal purpose for which God has created all things in order that through the church manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated to the principalities of the powers of the air and Bring them to a final defeat Who have been the rulers of this world's darkness and have kept men in bondage? Be loosed by a demonstration in every locality by the church that has consciously Perfected the wisdom of God and the character of its own corporate life that is free from intimidation free from threat free from insecurity Free from religious ambition ministerial ambition a church that has come to that freedom from the influence of the powers Actually exerts something in the spirit realm that defeats those powers that have rooted over that locality These are not innocuous spirit realms that are ineffectual they can touch our bodies They can start wars they can inflame men they can cause rage they can inspire punk rock culture They can inspire Nazism and take the land of Luther in the Reformation and make it an engine for the destruction of the chosen people of God They are a factual And there's only one agency given of God by which they can be recognized identified and combated. It's the church But it's the church that is the church And not the casual conglomerate of people who are merely sitting alongside each other for the benefit of the services But are the church and the corporate quality of life together by which the wisdom of God and the values of God the Moral quality of God is expressed in their truth of their life together Free from the influence of powers free from intimidation free from threat Well, if there's no other reason to have this book this is reason enough an entire chapter on the principalism powers I read it yesterday, but wow This is fantastic What a book Who's the author? Let me let me read you So it begins with the theme of the principalities and the powers of the year is foundational to all true seeing We have no claim to consider ourselves apostolic. Oh, I know you think you've graduated you have now a Western mindset Well, I want to tell you the Western mindset is itself the product of the principalities and powers and is not superior in any way to What is Eastern? Just a manipulation of another kind the only mindset that is a true mindset is that which is apostolic and Cosmic and sees this conflict as being since time immemorial and That is foundational to the perception of all reality Though it's intangible though. They are angelic spirit entities They have a profound influence over the conduct and course of individuals and nations It's a perspective that pertains to the whole reality of what God is about The church has characteristically major than the miners and ignored this major theme all our activity therefore is condemned to a certain kind of futility and fruitlessness if We miss the recognition of this cosmic struggle and refuse to participate in its conclusion It's the cosmic setting of the faith. You like the word cosmic mmm yummy, so is the church willing to make this demonstration and Thereby make known the manifold wisdom of God The willingness to take to itself this purpose that God says in that last verse This is the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus Well, what kind of a church is it that has not consciously and willfully? Chosen for itself this purpose as the first purpose for its being Understand what I'm saying? Beyond any other consideration young good works and poverty and sickness and Orphans and all the kinds of things that need to be addressed. This is the foremost purpose of God The eternal purpose of God to conclude this conflict with the powers of the earth by becoming a demonstration In ourselves of the manifold wisdom of God. Where is there a church that has consciously and willfully? Chosen to adopt this eternal purpose as the first purpose of its being before any other consideration Show me that church and I'll show you an apostolic entity And I'll tell you what the church that will do so signals to those powers that this is a people to be feared and opposed Because up to now those powers have yawned in our face We Americans we charismatic hot shots we're taking cities for Christ to worship blah blah blah blah blah We can't even fight our way out of a paper bag and we're taking cities because we have musical instrumentation Against which watchman he warned in the 1920s will be one of the most dangerous last days phenomenon because of the power of soul And we think that by it we're going to defeat powers of the air by raising the decibels of our sound through amplifiers What a what a statement of the puerile P E U R I L E condition of the present church So to take this first purpose the eternal purpose of God as the purpose for your being Although it has no practical benefit for you.

What do you gain by this?

You're making the enemy a conscious Opponent it would be better off if you let sleeping dogs lie and just go about your other business without Trifling and disturbing these principalities and powers they won't bother you They'll continue to say Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you? I think one of the most treasured prophecies that have ever been spoken over me was that the powers of the air will fear you art You're a man to be recognized and to be feared by the powers of darkness And will only attain a stature like that to the degree that we are indifferent to the recognition and the esteem that comes from men And we have a choice in the matter We want to be approved and recognized by men then the powers will continue to yawn in our face Because that itself is is a wisdom from below esteem recognition pride ego Better to be feared by the powers of darkness and to be esteemed and honored by men So I gave 300 Filipino pastors an invitation All of whom had come out of poverty And for the first time they had a suit of clothes on their back a little food on the table a little prestige a little stats status as ministers And I said I'm giving you a choice at the conclusion of my message You can go on and rise on the religious ladder the success and greater recognition by men and security or you can forfeit and risk all that and Become an formidable Opponent recognized by the powers of darkness. What do you choose to be esteemed of men and rise in religious? prestige or to be To turn your back on that and consciously to oppose the powers of darkness and to be known and feared by them Stand up if you choose the ladder. I'll tell you talk about men stopping breathing Silence came over that room They knew that their destiny was being affected in a moment of decision and slowly, but surely Men began to rise up out of the seats to stand and stand up Seats to stand and choose better to be known by the powers of darkness than to be recognized by men Have you ever come to that clear and conscious choosing Because when you will the powers of the air know who you are And it will bring a new quality of opposition or persecution That you had not before been required to experience But we know we need to know it's an earnest struggle and it's not a struggle that we can bear alone without each other Now we need prayer now.

We need intercession now.

We need the corporate strength of the body Before it was a luxury if we could enjoy it now It's absolutely essential because we are involved in ultimate utter Conflict with the powers of the air over the issue of who's going to prevail over the creation of God They want to continue to be the rulers of this world's darkness And if they could do it over Germany Where then can they not succeed and where are they not presently succeeding? lest the church Opposes them. It's the only agency in the earth Created and calculated by God both to recognize and to oppose those powers and to set them back and the release of the nations by the presence of another wisdom Demonstrated in the truth of their corporate life together So our warfare is not carnal and the instruments of our warfare are spiritual We're given armor where to be what is it? Dyer girded with truth and righteousness and sincerity We have to avoid deception Presumption and all the kinds of things that is the enemy's ground and the enemy's wisdom We have to be sincere and authentic and true in love and relationship and in light These are our weapons Of course we're in a great struggle That struggle compels us to be what we ought For the rest 12 of chapter 6 of Ephesians for we wrestle not against flesh and blood But against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore Take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand Stand therefore having your learns gird about with truth Having on the breastplate of righteousness. Oh Can we consider having that breastplate until The word evokes juices in our mouth when you hear righteousness you salivate You love righteousness Because the Son of God loved righteousness and hated iniquity It was his distinction as a son Righteousness is this not something to be acknowledged and admired it's to be loved he loved righteousness and You when you love it, you'll pursue it. You'll seek after it You'll find it in the little intricacies of relationship in life where truth is required speak the truth in love Face one another confess Deal with resentments and and and conceal things don't let them language don't let them hide don't let the pollutant corrupt the body Truth is a requirement righteousness is a requirement It's a humiliation to love righteousness and to pursue it But it's our armor Our feet shod with the preparation the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith Wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked and The helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching therein to with all perseverance and supplication for all saints Paul had his head screwed on right All knew what the issues were. You know, what kind of a church alone Could meet them in a world that was full of deviousness deception self-seeking Vanity This is the issue of the church's church We're going to see a last and violent expression of these powers Bored out against the house of Israel in the last days Called the time of Jacob's trouble What else would uproot Jews from their condominiums and their penthouses and in Toronto or New York City or Chicago or Hawaii Wheresoever they are and forced them overnight suddenly and abruptly Leave behind all their fortune all their possessions and to flee From a fearful antagonism that is pursuing them unto death That is the relentless expression of these powers seeking their annihilation This is the root cause of the time of Jacob's trouble that will uproot Jews throughout the world not just in the present nation, but wherever they are now safely established they will find themselves evicted as they were in the Nazi time and more ruthlessly hunted and pursued than even at that time and Likely, I think two-thirds of them will not survive this time question is Why are the powers of darkness so bent upon the annihilation of the Jew? Because the issue of the Jew and the issue of their redemption and their return Both to God and to the land and covenant relationship is the issue of Zion Is the issue of the Lord's kingdom and his coming it's the issue of his governmental rule over creation and the final Eviction of these false usurping powers that till now have been the rulers of this world's darkness You need to understand the cosmic Context in which the church is called to live out its life and purpose The underlying and great issue of the age is rule The law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem is not poetry It's God's literal intent Zion the holy hill Why not some great magisterial? mountain range Somewhere in Himalaya or Asia wouldn't that be more appropriate to the dignity of God? No He chooses a hill and he calls it. Holy because he has set his king on the holy hill of Israel of Zion Why I've given him the heathen and the nations for his rule. Oh You dear Saints if you can only put this on you can only see That the whole drama the great saga of the faith is the issue of a kingdom and the governance of God Over the nations that have been in rebellion since babel Until God in the very next chapter 12 calls Abram and through him Creates a nation and a people in whom in whom the government of God shall be established in the place of his choosing called Zion People are nothing in themselves God even reminds us don't think that I've chosen you because you're some great entity. No, I've chosen you because you're the least Because you're the least I've chosen your Zion because it's only a hill Because I'm a garden of such a kind and my wisdom requires that when I come into this earth, I'll be born in a stable When I leave this earth, I'll die as a criminal naked between criminals My whole testimony my life my suffering my birth and my death Is the statement of my wisdom of my essential character of my humility of my meekness? I choose the thing that is least and weak to confound and contradict that which the world purports to be strong and mighty and celebrated because there's a conflict of wisdoms a moral conflict of Which wisdom shall prevail? That which is of God demonstrated at the cross or that which is the power and the terror But the powers of darkness can marshal so that when that father had his son falling into the fire and Called the disciples of Jesus to to deliver him and they could not The Lord had to come and said to the father.

How long has your son been suffering this mark chapter 9?

since infancy The enemy has not just been out to harass the son but to destroy him Because the son is emblematic and symbolic of Israel itself and the disciples could not deliver him but Jesus commanded that that evil thing come out of him and He came out of that hour But not before he took a last attempt to like a dog with a rag doll in its mouth shaking it furiously To crush it and lay it down as dead If it's his last activity he's going to pour out Every ounce of contempt and power to destroy this despised entity that threatens the rule of those powers And Jesus stretched forth his hand and raised up that child.

He didn't just deliver him.

He resurrected him And later on the disciples said How is it that we could not cast out this cut this demon and Jesus said because this kind This ultimate kind cometh not out Except by fasting and prayer Listen you dear Saints. We're headed for a final showdown and exactly that drama you will have to be in the place of Jesus and to deliver Israel when the powers of darkness are furiously seeking to bring that nation to its death and The issue of your ability to contend against those powers Is to bring into that moment a greater reality than what they represent Because they are formidable and visible in the exercise of their intimidating power They are shaking the life out of that Sun and throwing him into the fire you have to bring to that moment a reality that is invisible and greater Knowledge of God and has already attained triumph and victory That you can express by faith and the authority that can even command those powers Which is more than just raising your voice Because the issue of authority is more than just volume. It's the knowledge of God Tempered by your history with him and the uses to which you have been put in the course of your history with God That has now come to a final showdown of which reality is the greater the enemy that is visibly throwing this young man into death And he they said he's as good as dead Or the reality that you bear and that you bring and express in faith in name of Jesus in Commanding that authority to be still and let him go and bother him no more So is it remarkable that the deliverance of Israel? rests upon a church that can assert a knowledge of God in a greater authority and The powers of darkness who seem at that moment Have all the cards and all the ability and all we have is our faith And the knowledge of God that is inward and true that is greater than that which is visibly before us Why could the disciples not assert that faith? Because this kind cometh not out except By fasting and prayer.

This is an ultimate kind.

This isn't your everyday demon This is this is the powers and their ultimacy out to reckon to destroy the greatest threat to their false rule There's a restored Israel That kind does not come out without fasting and prayer fasting and prayer is more than just denial of food It's more than petition It's prayer that is beyond petition It's prayer where you remain in the posture of prayer before God After you have made known all your need and desire and remain in the presence of God Not for your purposes, but for communion Because in that communion with God Something is being given and something is being received some sense of of the Lord himself the sense of God as God Which we which we lack and can only be obtained in that quiet devotional place And this kind cometh not out except by prayer of that kind But we're Chinese to Chinese with who utilitarian we we just pray the specific needs We don't know what means to pray beyond the issue of petition and need in prayer. That is devotion and not petition So isn't remarkable that the issue of Israel's deliverance in the last days has nothing to do with Israel's ability They will be as good as dead inert It will be something that comes to them from outside themselves from a church that knows God and Exhibits the reality of God in the face of the most intimidating circumstances, which does not in any way threaten them Because the knowledge of God in the interior life is greater than what is visibly set before them Therefore they can express that authority and the and the evil ones Recognize it and must bow and submit to it because what they have is the knowledge of God in the sense of God is very God himself The issue of Israel salvation is the issue of the church's devotion Not its heroics But it's devotion is inward and interior knowledge of God That does not come magically and in a moment, but is the sum of all of our moments and especially our early rising moments when our first Conduct is before the Lord on our knees and seeking him in the foolishness of that early morning time While the floor is cold and it seems like our prayer hardly it reaches the ceiling We need to learn devotion We need to learn God we need to Obtain the sense of him that he reserves for those who will seek him in the early morning quiet time So I wish that I myself were a better expression of that reality But I know it enough to Seek it daily I don't need to know and sense the presence in order to continue because that would make me a Sensual and carnal Christian who needs to be validated by feeling But if he says I'm with you always It is not the issue having to feel me. I'm present and I'm receiving your devotion your acknowledgement of me and my majesty by your willingness to Inconvenience yourself at the early morning time Because we know you have a thousand things to do and your mind is racing with this obligation in that and to put all that aside And just wait on the Lord to read from the psalm for the day the book of Proverbs for the day as I do and the devotional readings out of chambers and spurge in and Fill your spirit and soul with precious considerations out of the scripture and the Bible Out of the scripture out of devotional readings and then as I do I conclude or I begin by taking communion Yes, I have my bread with me and I need some wine or grape juice. I travel with it I Have a little ziplock bag with my unleavened bread that I can have an early morning communion with God It's the knowledge of him in a way. That's That's beyond categories It's an inward sense of the Lord that when there's a conflict of authority Something can be asserted that is the sum of all of your devotional times that At the powers of darkness recognized and stops them in their tracks because greater as he who is with you than you than he is in the world Israel's survival and salvation waits on your devotion. The world is locked in its egoistic egoistic self concern Take care of number one See to your own self interest watch out for your ministry for your future for your security if you don't who will Now you're number one. This is the power of the wisdom of the world that grips and locks men into such an egoistic prison The liberation for which for the church is to have a greater concern that is not their purpose their interest but his even his eternal purpose Demonstrate before the powers of the air and manifold wisdom of God Who consciously choose that as your first purpose? Though there's no practical benefit in choosing that but rather that it opens you to the new opposition from the enemy is itself the wisdom of God You're turning your back on the world's wisdom and not seeking your own vested interest even spiritually speaking You're seeking his eternal purpose and that is a liberation from the power of egoism and the very demonstration of the wisdom itself to choose God's purpose over your own his eternal purpose But of course will that render you of no valid good practically speaking in the world Because now you're occupied with the eternal purpose of God That's what the world will tell you.

You're so eternally minded.

You're no earthly good But when we look at the great apostle who dwelled in heaven and whose citizenship was in heaven and he was the man of time Eternity who who instructed the church on how to take the Lord's Supper who told him of how to deal with intransigent and fallen men who counseled them about widows and about Slaves who gave the church practical daily nitty-gritty nuts and bolts counsel on how to live as the church But the great apostle who is heavenly minded and occupied with eternity Won't hurt us a bit to become eternally minded. In fact, it will be all the more consequential Practically speaking now and in the earth Make God's purpose our first purpose for being is the wisdom of God But that was the that was the wisdom demonstrated at the cross Jesus did not seek his self-interest He forfeited every such consideration His only interest was serving the purpose of the father Even to the suffering that it required For that is the wisdom of God But for us and in the world the question is what's in it for me So long as we ourselves are affected and ruled by self-interest We have nothing to say to the principalities and powers of the air. They know whom to fear. They know whom to recognize Jesus they know and Paul they know because both of these exhibited another wisdom But who are you? I can't think of a more intimidating Insult and that the powers of the air can yawn in our face as being totally insignificant and any threat to their Influence over the localities in which we ourselves exist.

Who are you?

All of your presumptuous statements about taking cities are yawned You take nothing you have no authority have no real power Because your own life contradicts it your bodies in your congregations are shot through with unspoken resentment bitterness evil contempt unlove love and all the kinds of things that Make make for us to disregard you We don't see the divine wisdom in your life We don't see the nature and character of God prevailing in your fellowship We have no obligation to consider you you constitute no threat to out But the church that is the church just by what it is in itself In the character and nature of God It's very presence in that reality by which it has shucked off all of the influence of the powers and is not fearful for its security or for its future and Trust and is in faith and in love together The very presence of such a people dispels and breaks the Configuration of the powers that have prevailed over the locality and kept people imprisoned The Lord I'm praying For liberation of captives to come to localities in Asia Where the church comes of age by exhibiting the wisdom for which you're waiting The very nature of God that chooses the purposes of God over its own purposes That is not ruled by convenience and the benefit it receives that is willing to take on a loss of benefit and make itself an object of opposition and Persecution and disturbance by their powers in order to bring about their defeat So Lord open us to this category this cosmic understanding To recognizing those things that for which we have not been comfortable and have disregarded as maybe relics of earlier cultures, but to see it for the reality that it is Where if we don't see it as the church who will and if we don't combat it as the church who will?

It's our conflict.

It's our struggle You're waiting my God for the consummation of what you began at the cross You by the demonstration of the wisdom at the cross of the magnanimity and Patience suffering of God that forgives its oppressors you made of those powers and open spoil and disarm them, but you didn't Exterminate them you disarm them and allow them to continue their threatening intimidation So that the church will conclude what you began at the cross by exactly the same this Demonstration of the wisdom of God in the selfless giving up of its own life unto death for it does not seek How does it say it its own life? That's the wisdom of God Because it knows that it has in heaven a greater recompense Because it knows it can suffer the loss of all things and be stripped as I have been in times past Knowing that there's an eternal recompense greater than any loss and that we can take our stripping with joy and That joy when it is expressed in the moment of stripping contrary to anything that we could understand humanly Registers against the powers of darkness and defeats them because it's authentic. It's not famed It's a joy that knows in itself We have a greater recompense in heaven and we can bear the loss of all things Even our lives if God requires it and counted even the privilege of martyrdom When the enemy sees the people like that, they are finished.

Well, how shall they intimidate you? Where shall they threaten you but with the loss of life?
