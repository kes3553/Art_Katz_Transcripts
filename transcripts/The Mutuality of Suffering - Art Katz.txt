The Mutuality of Suffering - Art Katz

Turn to Isaiah 52. That's where Isaiah 53 rightly begins, knowing that it will never ever be spoken in a synagogue. When I read my mother Isaiah 53 for the first time, she said, where in the New Testament are you reading? I said, I'm not reading from the New Testament. I'm reading from the Old, from Israel's greatest prophet of the Messiah, Isaiah.

She said, I've never heard that. And the synagogue, I said, you never will. It's omitted.

They'll read up to Isaiah 52-12 and the following week they can continue with Isaiah 54.

And if you ask, how come?

Well, that's the rabbinical councils have determined the Haftorah readings. Haftorah means from the prophets. So every Shabbat, as they go through a year's reading of the five books of Moses, there's also a selection from the prophets, in keeping with the selection from the five books of Moses. But they don't exhaust the prophets, so they single out what text they think would be appropriate, but they conspicuously omit this text.

And the answer, I think, is evident. It is too conspicuously Christological.

Verse 10 of 52 says, the Lord hath made bear his holy arm in the eyes of all nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God. I believe that that verse is yet to be fulfilled, unless you think so. You think all the world, the ends of the earth, have seen the salvation of God? That the Lord has made bear his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations? After all, it was just an obscure act in a remote place, and wasn't even comprehended by those in whose midst it was performed. So how can this verse then be descriptive of it, unless there's a future fulfillment?

Well, what does that mean, Katz?

Are you saying Jesus must a second time pass through Calvary? No, but there will be a demonstration of the suffering through which he passed, that will serve the world to glimpse what they have not understood nor rightly considered. So verse 15, the last verse of that chapter says, so shall he sprinkle many nations, the king shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they see, and that which they have had not heard, shall they consider. Let me pray, because this is walking out on a limb, and I don't know of anyone else who has this perspective. That doesn't mean that that it's a heresy to interpretation, a putting together of things that I'm privileged to consider by the Lord, and see that there's a destiny for Israel beyond its own present understanding that will fulfill these scriptures. That Israel will be called in their last days' suffering to replicate, repeat, and demonstrate the very sufferings of Jesus 2,000 years earlier, so nations will be without excuse that the arm of the Lord has not been revealed. And in the very process of it, Israel will itself come to the recognition that it has been 2,000 years in denying. There's nothing like, excuse my language, the mutuality of suffering to reveal something that you would otherwise perhaps not be disposed to see. But suffering reveals, there's something about the nature of suffering that strips away the veneer, that removes the pretenses, the amenities of life, that disguise and shield reality itself. You know it from your own experience if you've been sick, but to be sick unto death, everything is reduced to what is ultimately earnest, deadly serious, in a way that you would not have seen it if you were abounding in health. Suffering does serve that purpose. And my nation, don't forget it, have a calling not yet fulfilled. I wonder how many of you could tell it, recite what that calling is, of which Paul says in Romans 11, that great statement, that that calling is irrevocable, means it's not taken back, it's without repentance, it must be fulfilled.

What's the calling?

A nation of priests and a light unto the world.

You know what you guys are enjoying in these days?

A preview of things to come. Kit Kats is a piece of restored Israel before the time.

And aren't you receiving a very particular benefit?

And I don't know to what degree it's the expression of my calling or the expression of my racial Jewish identity, because we do have somehow a handle, a certain way of understanding and expressing that may be unique to us. So to what I thought was individual is really the expression of what my entire redeemed nation will be performing in their restored priestliness and the fulfillment of their call, because the world is living in a sub place that's beneath God's intention, because they are intended as a nation of priests and a light unto the world. Would Australia be as materialistic as it is, as God resisting and rejecting as it is, if there were waves of a people who have a very particular call to teach the nations the difference between the sacred and the profane? How profane would we be if we had waves of these priestly ministers coming to us who not only proclaim the difference but are themselves the demonstration? You need to understand this. We're living in a beneath the intention of God world, a reality that has been devoid of a powerful and necessary ingredient that God and his wisdom determined in the election and choice and selection of that nation.

Can you see why their restoration is so critical?

The issue of Israel is the issue of the nations.

They're not made for themselves.

That's why I'm going to have seven nations in seven weeks, having just come back from three in Latin America, and before that I can't even keep track. There's hardly a place on the earth where I've not been in 41 years. In September I'm believing to be in the Chinese mainland, Korea for a first time, Japan, I've been there many times. We Jews are for the nations. The nation Israel is for the nations, and we're out of kilter. We're missing the benefit that God intended through a redeemed nation who know their God and make him known. So that is yet to be fulfilled. The question is how do they go from their present apostasy, hatred and enmity against Jesus, which is still powerful, and their orthodoxy, that ten percent or so that that can be described as orthodox, are more orthodox in their practice than they are in their belief. We Jews are eminently rationalistic, empirical, and though we are fastidious, the orthodox ones, in the particulars of diet and other fastidious attentions to practice and detail, when you check them and press them, they cannot surrender to the belief in things supernatural. Where did Reform Judaism have its origin?

Who can guess?

In what nation did this liberal aspect of Judaism?

See, I don't know where you guys are. Shall I just assume you're just Gentile dum-dums? Okay.

You know that there are three essential branches of Judaism. Reform conservative orthodox, and even in orthodox there are varieties of persuasion. Many of them are an enmity one with another, and count other orthodox sects as being outside of Judaism because they don't have the side curls, or because this or one thing or another, or they're in dispute about their rabbis. There's a great deal of contention. It's not some simple categorical this, this, and this, but the most liberal of all the forms of Judaism is called Reform, and there they have even taken out references from the Psalms and scripture that are suggestive or indicative of a God supernatural performs miracles because it's an embarrassment to the secular rational mind that yet wants to retain some aspect of Jewish identity. So what country was that form of Judaism elaborated and birthed?

Germany. Why?

Because Germany itself was eminently rationalistic and came to a place even in its Christianity where it rejected and shrank from its own supernatural references. After all, Germany is the land of science, ethics, philosophy, and the Jews in Germany reflected that national culture and toned down their own Judaism to make it more acceptable to the German mainstream. Little wonder that Germany becomes our graveyard because we forsook biblical faith and admired German civilization and had more respect for Berlin than we did for Jerusalem, and if you follow out the historic records of conferences by Jewish groups in Germany in the 19th century, the early 20th century, they affirmed that they were more German than they were Jewish. They wanted to be part of the state, the culture, and indeed they were until the bottom dropped out. So in my own encounter with them, even with Orthodox Jews, I find that they wince and shrink from the full supernatural implication of God as God. It offends the rational disposition of modern Jews, though in their practices they can be very observant. That's not the least of the reasons why in their final dispersal through the nations, and this is my last message I think where I came from the other day, that they will be required to experience God in his supernatural power as the key to their own deliverance out of dungeons, prisons, cells, and bars, and bonds out of which they would never have been extricated by man except God himself in supernatural power will find them and release them and return them. They're going to experience the supernatural reality of God.

They must.

How else shall they be priests if they don't know God in this dimension? How shall they commend him to the nations if they have only a truncated, rationalistic, rabbinical view which is their present understanding? To know God is to experience God. To know about the resurrection is to be raised. So you need to know that's why Israel in view of its calling and significance for the nations is required to follow out a scenario of remarkable suffering at the end of the age in which the majority of Jews presently alive will not survive.

A remnant will return.

The redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion with everlasting joy on their heads and mourning and sighing fleeing away. Now you see this makes a requirement of you.

You can't afford to be a Gentile dum-dum.

You've got to be a biblical exegete.

Why?

Because in these powerful concluding verses you have a conjunction of everlasting joy and mourning and sorrow.

How come?

Because the last historic experience of the nation in its uprooting dispersal and being harassed and pursued by Islamic fanatics will not be content with anything less than their blood and will succeed in destroying many will be the mourning and sighing. And even the the mourning and sighing of the loss of the state of Israel which is a hope for many Jews not only in Israel but in the world. That there's a sense of security that at least if Israel exists whatever can go wrong with us in the places elsewhere will be on the world we know that there remains a haven and a home. But if that is destroyed if that is uprooted if that is dissolved and there those people there are suffering great attrition and expulsion then there's a collapse for the entire worldwide Jewish community in its morale its hope and its expectancy. You know that the national anthem of Israel ha-tikvah ha-the-tikvah hope. But hope in what rather than hope in whom.

When you hear the lyrics there's no reference to God.

It's not an issue of hope in God. In the last analysis it's almost a hope in the state which is to say hope in man. So when we get to Ezekiel 37 the Valley of Dry Bones what is God waiting for? When they themselves say in verse 11 we are without hope we are cut off we are as dry bones.

That statement has never been made nationally. Even the Nazi Holocaust did not obtain it. In fact what other statement did issue from the Holocaust?

Not we are cut off we are dry bones but rather never again.

See the unique opportunity you guys have with me?

Rare perspective resisted even by other messianic Jews and leaders. I'm persona non grata in Israel. Not by the state but by the believers. They don't want to hear this apocalyptic view of last day's suffering, last day's devastation, last day's expulsion, last day's sifting. They want somehow for this state and to progressively improve. Amelioration improvement is a statement of humanism contrary to biblical expectation. God does not improve. He brings them to death and resurrection. The reason you don't know it is you have shrunk from that reality yourself. I'm not just speaking to you I'm speaking into the tape to those who will be hearing this far beyond you to whom that would be applicable. Very few in the church know the power of resurrection and move and live and and have their being in its reality.

Why?

It's an enjoyable thing it's the rest of God but the entryway is through death. I'm not talking about physical death but the more costly and painful deaths physical death might be the easiest. I'm talking about the death of humiliation, the prospect of failure trusting God. What if he doesn't come through and your face is sticking out before entire audiences and the expectancy of churches and nations.

There's a dying of which Paul speaks daily.

Because he died daily he was experiencing the life daily. He says death that works in me life in you. Paul is a forerunner of the nation's own restoration. That's why he said I'm a man out of time, out of joint and out of time. I'm born before the time but what you see in me is what yet will come. The nation will become Pauline, it will become apostolic, it will be priestly and powerful, know God and make him known and love the Gentiles.

Can you imagine that?

That when Paul knew that his time was over, the end of his tenure, he went to near Ephesus, I forgot the place in Acts 20 and called for the elders of Ephesus and when he called they came and they didn't just hop on a bus. It was an arduous journey to be with Paul before his shipping out that would lead to his being beheaded at Rome.

He said you'll see my face no more.

You know what manner of man I was with you from the first.

Yes they knew that.

You know that I never withheld from you the entire council of God.

I didn't butter you up. I didn't just give you the pretty side. I told you about the cross.

I myself was the demonstration of the brutality and suffering that one's experiences and faithfulness to this God.

I didn't ever make it easy for you. I gave you the whole council. I told you the last day's things. I went from house to house with tears.

Public places, house to house daily proclaiming to you the entire council of God.

They knew it. I never took a thing from you.

I worked and labored with my own hands not to be a burden to the church. And so he bowed down and they bowed down with him on the beach and hung on his neck and wept that they would not see his face again. Dear Saints you have to know how remarkably historic that is that a Jew out of an ultra-orthodox rabbinical background always will read a superior sense of contented disdain for the goyim.

You know who the goyim are? The Gentiles. They're dum-dums. They lack sense. They spend their money. They don't save. They're reckless. They drink. They fornicate. They're unclean.

They're uncircumcised. There's an innate contempt and disdain for Gentiles by those Jews who see themselves as being spiritually, morally, ethically superior. Never once did Paul ever, ever breathe, intimate, or show such a sense of contempt for the Gentile Church whose apostle he was. Why didn't God send them to the Jews? The guy had a phenomenal rabbinical background. God sends Peter, a fisherman, to be the apostle to the circumcision and he sends Paul, this remarkable rabbinical genius, to the goyim.

Why?

Because in that God is already indicating what the role of the apostolic nation will be in the millennium and eternally. Its ministry is to the nations.

The word goyim means nations.

They're the Jews and then there are the nations. So as he goes to the nations as an apostle, the redeemed nation will go to the nations as a nation of priests and the light unto the world.

Got the picture? Do you understand those things?

This is the most basic framework of the understanding of the cosmic purposes of God in the mystery of Israel and the Church.

Where does the Church come in?

The Church comes in by being Israel's salvific agent in its last days extremity and suffering. For if you will not and not extend mercy and see to the least of these his brethren who are naked, thirsty, hungry, and in prison, there will be no Jewish survival at all. If you'll extend yourself to Jews at that time, when they're globally universally hated, beat up, marred, and you're caught at it, identified with them, you put yourself in peril and the Jews will know it.

And they'll say, what are you doing?

You're threatening your own security, that of your children and family to help us? We're so globally despised and you're wanting to help us at risk? They'll be moved to jealousy because they have never seen a demonstration like this from men out of their philanthropy, goodwill, good deeds, or anything like that that is only humanistic or religious. This transcends all categories. There's only one way to explain this kind of benevolence to Jews in their distress at the risk of to the life of Gentiles.

It's God. They'll see it and know it.

That's why Paul answering the question of the Roman Church, is God finished with the Jews? Have they had their opportunity and blown it and now we take over, we become the Israel of God?

He says, God forbid. The strongest language in Greek that I don't know but they say there's no stronger statement than God forbid that you should think that. God's not finished with them, Paul says. They've stumbled. They doesn't use the word fall.

They've stumbled but through their fall, that momentary displacement, salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to move them to jealousy. You'll never be the church until you take that statement to heart and fulfill it.

But by what means? Can you do it now?

Is there enough spiritual reality in this room and authentic worship and transcendent personality and character of God that Jews stumbling upon the church would see it evidently and be moved to desire whatever it was that brings you to this place as Gentiles?

The answer is clear. No, not yet. But how did I get saved?

You need to read Ben Israel, ex-Marxist Jewish atheist, uprooted from California not by persecution but by moral collapse of a failed marriage to a German and other kinds of exigencies that shattered my humanistic confidence and assumption. And so I couldn't go on teaching because this is something about us Jews. We cannot go on to raise questions for students that we ourselves are not able to answer. I was acutely aware of my moral predicament for which my Marxist ideology and humanistic assumptions were inadequate.

And so what do you do in a case like that? You quit teaching.

You put a pack on your back and you go footloose through the world, the Western world, where we Jews have had such history and you look for some unturned philosophical stone that will begin to give you explanation and understanding that you can go on.

You don't look for God. No atheist looks for God.

He doesn't know there's a God to be found. But unbeknownst to him, there was a middle-class roly-poly woman who was the mother of one of my students and she and her daughter were praying for me every day for 14 months of that travel and that trip. That when I came back months later as saved and gave my first testimony, I didn't know what a testimony was, this lady came up and said, Brother Cats.

Imagine how strange that sounds to Jewish ears, Brother Cats. You don't know me, she said. You had my daughter in your history class.

She knew you were an atheist and a radical and she came home every day from school weeping over you. Since that day she said, both my daughter and I have been praying for you. When she said that, the Lord gave me a dig in my ribs with his elbow and said, she's the one whose prayers have entered you into the kingdom of heaven. Listen dear saints, you need to read that book. Jewish atheists picked up off the side of the road, menacing figure.

I mean even now he's dangerous.

Then you should have seen, I was a man whose the world had and its Gods had failed me. I was angry by the side of road, especially standing by the side of road two, three hours in the drizzle and the rain and cars whizzing by as if I didn't exist.

Not looking, they don't want to see.

Who's going to pick up these Jews with the least of these his brethren if they will whizz by and not see.

But there were people who stopped.

Invariably born-again Christians, who else would stop for a piece of questionable humanity like that and take the risks of it. And every time there was a conversation, every time there was something shared, my heart was strangely warmed, prepared for the day in which the New Testament would come into my hands for the first time. Never having ever read the New Testament or even the Old Testament.

Jewish atheist.

The very first reading, pow, out of the mouth of this Jesus, let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Something went through me like a knife sword I was cut in two.

I knew that I knew that that's beyond any human wisdom.

That's a divine utterance and it's coming out of the mouth of this Jesus, who's forgiving Jews their sins and exercising the prerogatives of God.

Can you understand the astonishment, the shaking, the revelation? And my first cry was not Eureka. My first cry was, what's your mother going to say about this, Katz? And she did. Did she ever.

Slammed the door in my face in her Brooklyn apartment house where she lived at that time and cried out, he's gone mad, he's gone mad, he's gone mad. But 40 years later, 10 days before her death in her 96th year, 3 o'clock in the morning, having had a dream of hell that drove her to frenzy and panic, they called me, I was ready up to come to my mother's side because we had kidnapped her from Florida, lock stock and barrel and moved to the Minnesota in January. In the winter, we could have been sued, imprisoned, but I knew it was my only opportunity to do that because I had other commitments and she was balked but we finally got out of Minnesota, built her a little place next to mine and so when the crisis moment came I could come down instantly, took my hand and out of my mouth poured one prophetic prophecy after another, oh Bethlehem of Freyda, though thou be least of the cities of beauty, yet out of it, out of thee shall he come forth who is to be ruler in all Israel, whose goings forth are from old and from everlasting.

I didn't know I knew that many. She was just like a flood of Scripture, just washed.

She was washed by the word of the word and within 20 minutes, willing to take my hand and follow me in a prayer to receive the Lord, my mother could never speak the name of Jesus peaceably, only as a curse, only as a blasphemous, the same thing that I used to do, but for the first time she could call on the name of the Lord. It wasn't easy but she passed from death to life and the moment after she prayed she prayed again, God she said if I've done anything wrong please forgive me. That's how instinctive is this antipathy toward Jesus as if we're joining us in foreign cult when he's our Messiah and our God.

Well guess what?

She's looking down tonight from the invisible cloud of witnesses and she's saying to the others up there, that's my boy. This is a massive thing that I'm trying to put before you tonight and your flesh will shrink from its consideration that not the least reason for the final last day's suffering of Israel is the redemptive portent not only for itself but for the nations because kings shall shut their mouths who have not yet presently done so and that which had not been told them shall they see. There's got to be a visible demonstration of Isaiah 53 of a suffering servant marred more than any man having no beauty that any should desire him that they might see what took place 2,000 years ago and cannot again of course be re-performed but they'll see the essence in the sufferings that befall the servant nation even in their unbelief in apostasy and make the application that what they were seeing in this people is what their Messiah and Lord performed 2,000 years ago so they shall they shall consider what they had not heard and I don't think I'm just speaking about pagan Islamic Hindu nations I think I'm speaking also about nominal Christian nations who have not understood and deeply appropriated the cross they need another demonstration they need another powerful statement of the suffering of the Lord the Messiah that somehow we have robbed of its significance and and sentimentalized and the last analysis trivialized even with the Gibson film of the excruciating sufferings I left that theater disappointed there was a no end of blood and gore but there wasn't a width of explanation as to as to why it was being shed there was no redemptive note in that film it was a Catholic sentimental bash to wallow in the pity and sentimental preoccupation with a suffering man without explaining the reason for the suffering got the understand that in a word the age must conclude with one more and final reiteration of the cross why because the cross is the nexus of reality the cross is the central episode it's the divine intrusion into time and history and place because the cross is the ultimate revelation of God as God and his triune makeup you reject that you miss that you miss the glory of God and you'll have a truncated religion even though you use the vocabulary it will not have the the the vibrancy and reality that the true apprehension of the cross communicates and makes available we can all use another shot of this we can all use a fresh appropriation of the setting forth of the cross as was experienced by Jesus and the fulfillment of this classic prophetic text Israel needs to see it the nations need to see it and the slack shallow nations of Christendom need a renewed opportunity to understand what is central even to their own faith let's look at the text itself first of all begins in 13 my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high that's certainly a description of Jesus why is he at the throne now because he was abased at the cross before God will extol a suffering servant and so also will he extol the nation you know that Israel will be the foremost nation among all nations you know that Deuteronomy 32 8 says that when God established the number of the nations he did so with regard to the number of the nations Israel is in relationship to nations they will no longer be the tail they'll be the head Zion Jerusalem will not to be their capital but the global capital the throne of God will be in their Zion the law will go forth out of Zion the word of God out of Jerusalem to all nations how do you know that art Isaiah chapter 2 Micah 4 1 well that's just poetry art that's you know figure Zion oh yeah well then how come they're going to turn their their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and study war no more could there be anything more graphic and tangible that something has happened in world government that nation ceased from war and there's only one place where that government will issue out of Zion not New York Geneva but that holy hill that pimple why that's what God chooses what why do you think we're here look at us and in this place he chooses the foolish and weak thing invariably in fact he said of Israel I've not chosen you because you're great and mighty I chose you because you're the least of nations Zion is the least but it's just God has this kind of preference but we need to understand it and submit to and agree with what he has chosen because the God who chooses is God I am who I am I will be whom I will be I will elect what I will elect I'll have mercy upon whom I'll have mercy eat your heart out you thought Australia was the better candidate Sydney especially beautiful harbor like where you can see the World Global Center rising up on the horizon sorry about that not only must you submit to and recognize what he has chosen but you need to agree with it and annually at the Feast of Tabernacle send your representation to honor the nation that he has extolled and made very high just as their Lord before them not because they deserve it it has not a thing to do with deserving it has everything to do with choosing I am who I am I will be who I book and I'm going to show that by the kinds of choices that I will make that will be contrary to everything that and anything you would have chosen and if there's a vestige of conceit in your Gentile heart and anti-Jewish propensity they don't deserve and you deserve more it will flush it out it will be revealed and and you're going to act on that God said you'll be cursed no rain you refuse to come up okay no rain for you that indicates that he has to make a threat because there's still a residue of anti-Jewish sentiment among the goyim that even though they see that he has extolled the nation he has restored them established his Zion and he rules from it as the son of David from the throne of David they still shrink from coming up and acknowledging and bowing to this people whom he has extolled how proud are you guys anyway that he's got to threaten you with curse because you're unwilling you drag your feet which is so self-defeating because his genius has established the tent of Shem as the place in which Japheth should dwell you'll always be Japheth they'll always be that European Anglo-Saxon brittle technical personality that's great as factories and and production and economy but lacks a spiritual quotient you'll never develop that of yourself independently of them you have to dwell in the tent of Shem there is a dimension that waits for your completion or else you'll inflict yourself upon the world again World War one World War two was not enough there'll be other expressions of your Japheth ability that can turn blessing into economy but also can turn danger and even destruction of civilization unless you're tempered where will you find that tempering the place where God has reserved it their tent tent of Shem and you can't walk in erect with all of your full dignity you've got a bow to enter see the genius of God the only hang up is Israel itself is not in its own place it's not yet that tent in fact Israel today the Jews are more are more Japheth than Japheth full of economy and finance and stocks and bonds and and production and all these kinds of things then Japheth himself we've we're missing our own calling but we will be brought into it through suffering we have to be over be no tent for you to enter what will it take art it's going to take this a reiteration of the suffering of Jesus as a servant people called to servanthood to be a priestly people which means our ability not just to go to the Gentiles with reluctance and find a way to dig them which I used to do in my early years as a believer the Lord dealt with me there was something residual in my Jewish nature that especially a prophetic man has opportunity to put the knife in but to turn the hilt and enjoy it the Lord had to deal with me and other Jewish believers and he will deal with them there cannot be any mischief like that when they come to the nations they've got to be as self-serving as as self self less as Paul himself and the believers knew it when they said goodbye to Paul and wept when they when he said you'll see my face no more they loved the man he was a father to them he was a mother he was a nursing mother he wept over them he has there ever been an instance where a Jew has ever had such relationship with Gentiles that transcends every cultural racial ethnic consideration where did he obtain that he obtained it in Acts 13 in Antioch separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the work into I've called them because I perceive now they have come to a place of separation even from their intrinsic Jewish disposition against Gentiles because they're in a congregation with black white Romans and and every variety of mankind and they're found now worshipping God together separate for me men who've been separated from ambition from racial ethnic identity now I want this brought into the world to bless it's a picture of Israel's future Saints you've got to appreciate this God's cosmic intention for the blessing of creation through a restored priestly nation who will be to the nations what Paul was to the Gentile Church they will be extolled and very high but art wouldn't that make them proud not when you've been through the cruncher not when you've been battered and bruised and been brought very low not when your face is marked more than any man and you'll and you have no beauty that any should desire you not when you go through a time of Jacob's trouble for three and a half years even though he'll save you out of it you will never forget the depths to which you were brought and the suffering that you bore and its analogy to the suffering which he bought that will be a permanent disposition in your priestly character because of a lesser priest is barefoot he's not a priest at all you don't come with your feet enclosed you're on the earth with those to whom you minister you see why suffering is necessary if you're getting any measure of blessing from me and you don't have to hear the story of it or the details you know there's a private history that has to do with suffering with anguish of soul with the dealings of God the breakings of God or he would not lose me on Gentile audiences I'd be dangerous so he tempers his servants and he'll temper his servant nation by the things to which they are required to pass so when I read this though it's perfectly a description of the sufferings of Jesus now I'm going to read it as if it's a description of a future suffering soon to take place for Jews worldwide though Jesus was a tent to plant out of a dry ground he had no form no commas neither will they they will have no form no commas and when people shall see them there's no beauty that any should desire them they'll be despised and rejected of men they will be a people of sorrow isn't that what said sorrow and and mourning will will flee they will be acquainted with grief you can believe it and because of it they will come to a fresh reappraisal of the Jesus whom we have historically rejected as just a guy who ran afoul of Roman authorities and suffered the penalty now we will understand his sufferings out of the mutuality of our own and we'll be saying we hit it as it were our faces from him he was despised we didn't esteem him surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken even prefer him smitten of God and afflicted but now we recognize he was wounded for our transgressions there's nothing like suffering to reveal truth particularly truth of this kind he was bruised for our iniquities they didn't know they had iniquities until they're on the road and being rejected and cast out and and the consciousness that this is not arbitrary that there's a judgment that we're fulfilling you know that Jesus was judged did you know that the cross was judgment the wrath of God fell upon him for sin and so judgment is the revelation of wrath for sin and Jews who are experiencing it will for the first time consider their own transgressions which consciousness is virtually absent from all modern Jews today it's a strange condition we have no sin consciousness but when we are stricken and recognize that this devastation that has beset us as a nation is no mere anti-semitic episode or accident very God has inflicted us and reveals by that affliction in judgment sin because sin will never reveal itself as sin it always disguises itself how then is sin known when we see the judgments required to expiate it they will begin to be conscious of their transgressions and in that consciousness and in the similarity of the suffering of Jesus who preceded them they will say surely he bore our griefs carried our sorrows he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities we didn't even know that we had iniquities my God you don't know you've got 2,000 years you've got four or five thousand years of apostasy idolatry golden calves whoredoms false Gods right into the house of God you brought your idols you made the provision for the the what's that woman the Goddess of the pagans and and you brought your children through the fire for Moloch you you've done the most hideous things in your history that any nation has ever done before God and you were called of God you had the advantage of Sinai and Moses you had the prophets you had the law so for you this is heinous this is more hideous you suffer you're suffering double for your transgressions this this is what needs to impact us where is the Jew that has any awareness of our historic past and the controversy that we yet have with God that we have not acknowledged let alone met one of my sufferings in New York was to attend a lecture by a hot shot businessman who thinks he's spiritual to explain what is the root cause of anti-semitism I went running you know what his explanation was it's our virtue the world hates our virtue we're too ethical we're too moral and that's what has excited the anti-semitism again tomorrow hey have you read the Bible lately have you seen the controversy have you heard the cry of the prophets have you seen how in before God's very face we've blasphemed his name in all nations they have not understood saints and you haven't told them you're too nice you don't want to irritate you don't want to offend you want to make nice and love them cop-outs if they'll not hear it from you from whom shall they hear it and when you meet them in this condition you're not only going to mop their brow and wipe the blood out of their eyes but you're going to explain to them why they're suffering their present affliction you yourself will be priestly and prophetic so much at art what makes you think that even they go through this expulsion and sifting through the nations and and are restored to Zion that they'll not be another future expulsion that's been the history of Israel judgment sin expulsion why do you say this is the last well the scriptures indicate but more than that in this expulsion rather than any previous time they're going to find not only to be succored and aided and receive palpable mercy of a material kind but also a spiritual kind they will be told they will be informed they will be instructed believe us now this am I just banging my guns in vain you realize what an advantage for you this is saving you from yourselves being apostate because Paul says one of the signs of the last days is a great falling away and more than any reason that I suspect will be the disappointment of shallow Christians for the failure of the net of Israel to succeed as a nation and for the uprooting of Jews worldwide again within a generation and a suffering that will eclipse even the Nazi time where's God to allow this a second time what about my expectations what about my thought I thought that Israel was the fulfillment of prophecy that this nation would would then improve and go on and and now it's dispersed and Jews everywhere being uprooted are pursued for their lives and and nations can't help them even France has told the Jewish community we can't protect you though it's the largest Jewish community in Europe 500,000 but there are also five to ten million Muslims we can't protect you and the Jewish community is telling its own don't go in the street with a young look on don't wear your star of David don't be visibly Jewish you'll get beat up and furthermore you would do well to learn another language pack your bag and be prepared to move France is no longer safe England is no longer safe Germany is no longer safe and the time will come when America is no longer safe I'm waiting to hear verse 6 this national acknowledgement all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted and unlike us who moan and groan and complain and how come what what we have to suffer he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is done so he opens not his mouth that that's got to be the proof of his messianic call and the fulfillment of Scripture because he had every provocation to break silence on the cross in the excruciating agony of being nailed having been flagellated to nigh unto death to hear the taunt and mock of his own people come down and we'll believe you if you be the Son of God if there's anything in him that wants to get even and say you dumb so-and-so's I'm I'm on this cross for you and you're taunting and mocking and telling me to come down I've had it with you and then he went as a lamb to the slaughter silently under the most extreme duress and provocation because he was an obedient son of God fulfilling the prophetic scriptures to the syllable had he failed in one thing he would have failed in all and Jews now out of their noise and contention striped how come will recognize this through this one who's preceded us and whose suffering was in kin to ours bore it without a sound all he said was father forgive them they know not what they do so he was taken from prison from judgment and who shall declare his generation he was cut off out of the land for the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken now you Bible exegetes know that with that first the voice has changed what began with the narration of the prophet and then the exclamation of the nation has now moved and shifted to another voice very God himself in one chapter you have three different entities expressing and reflecting on this central episode in the history of all creation the the single greatest episode of time and history in place the crucifixion of Jesus for the transgression of my people was he stricken he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief and when you shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of the soul indicates that this one who dies at the cross through this suffering yet will live eternally to see the fruit of his own sacrifice so you have both death and resurrection at the same text he shall see of the travail of the soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge or by the knowledge of him shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I God is still speaking divide him a portion with the great and she and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out a soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors can you understand why this is omitted from synagogues when my mother never heard it she said I'm going to go but I'm going to ask the rabbi when I go back to Florida how come it's omitted she never did it's too evidently Christological and so what what men want to censor and keep from the consideration of Jewish community will one day be open to them out of their own mutuality and experience and when they stop and we take them in and over the kitchen table as we're giving them a cup of tea and wiping their wounds and comforting them comfort you comfort you mighty people for they have suffered double for their transgressions we will then show them in the scriptures what they're bearing it's a great final episode saints it's the restoration of Zion of Israel and the remarkable thing is that not only does the nation learn of the significance of its Messiah through the experience of a like kind but the nations the kings that had not been sprinkled and not been told them they shall see and that which they had not heard they shall consider so it's not only Israel's redemption it's that of the nations how do you like them apples doesn't the Lord know how to do it that with Israel's suffering the church itself even the slack nominal church is compelled to be reacquainted and see the reiteration of the cross as it is explicated in the suffering of this people through all nations no one is going to miss this he's sifting through all nations it's not head it will be before the face of all nations and even nominal Christian nations will have an occasion to see and come to a deepened faith by recognizing in the suffering of the Jew what their Messiah had borne long before them for the recognition of that suffering is salvation that's the conclusion of the age Israel is restored Jesus occupies the throne of David as the son of David comes with his wounds we shall see him whom we have pierced and if we're not brought to salvation already by the mutuality of our experience when we see those wounds where we're gone us if there's any last thing that needs to conclude the depth of our understanding it will be his personal coming and when we shall see him whom we have whom we have pierced we shall mourn for him as one mourns for one's only son and be in bitterness as one for one's firstborn every family apart husbands and wives apart the depth of this repentance the cry the of angry souls for the 2,000 year neglect refusal rejection and blasphemy of our own Messiah whose salvation we we rejected and therefore were open to the colossal enmity of the powers of darkness we had no capora we had no covering that we had to wear those little beanies saves you from nothing his blood saves you and covers you Yom Kippur the day of atonement what is it today go to the synagogue a day of fasting good deeds where does it say that in the Bible the Bible says without the shedding of blood is is no remission for sin we have been 2,000 years without blood without sacrifice without a priesthood and we have paid for that can you imagine the depth of that recognition when it smites you in one fell swoop in a final moment I would want to spare any Jew from having to learn in that moment the whole weight of the past and be crunched in such a way that they cannot even bear to repent in the presence of any human being husbands and wives apart families apart the cry that will rise up out of the earth and the depth of that chagrin has never been known in the history of mankind our nation will die you know travail of that kind repentance of that kind is hardly less than death you you pour your guts out you can't breathe it's suffocating your choke your splutter it's a nigh unto death and that will eventuate in resurrection a nation will come up out of that depth of repentance unlike anything that is presently understood by the name Israel rather the present name should be Jacob but then Israel will emerge new nature new character new new heart new spirit I'll give them a new spirit a new covenant an everlasting covenant why never again be broken not because of their virtue but because of me they'll not again fail I'll write my law in their hearts in the inward parts there'll be another nation and a blessing to every nation because God's promise to Abraham has got to be fulfilled I will I will you will bless all the families of the earth you're living beneath that blessing right now although you're getting a measure of it tonight in these days it ought to be enough to wet your appetite for the much greater fulfillment when the entire nation is restored and not just someone splintered entity in a single man and you need to be laboring for that preparing for that be willing to sacrifice for that because if you will not succor them in this time of travail and devastation when they're marred more than any man there'll be no survival your mercy your love your kindness will move them to jealousy save them out of death and eternal damnation your prophetic ability to explain their distress will be a life-saving provision the redeemed of the Lord will return to Zion because of you and it's for that reason that you're born it's for that reason that you're saved because the nations then will themselves bow every knee will bow every tongue will confess Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father they'll know no longer Islamic tensions who is God there is only one God it's Israel's God who has demonstrated himself again globally through his people shown the significance of his suffering in his blood and calls all nations to bow and to avail themselves of that so great atonement Lord I believe help them my unbelief don't let me look into the face of unbelief can we pray sense on this Passover night they're breaking their monster they're eating their unleavened bread they're not eating lamb they're having turkey or chicken lamb is not eaten in Jewish households but there's a shank bone I'll show you tomorrow on the Seder plate as a memorial for something that they can hardly identify there are three priests of matzah and the middle piece has to be taken out and broken father son and Holy Spirit they don't know why there's a chair for Elijah but where is he who can come and explain that's you so Lord we bless our Jewish people tonight our kinsmen the least of your brethren we're joined with them Lord and we thank you for the privilege that will be ours to beat to them what we must what we ought or where will their survival than their salvation come in that terrible thing that shall befall them and we understand my God more why they must pass through this time of suffering for it will reveal to them who you are what you have already performed 2,000 years ago that has been lost to their consciousness and at the same time nations shall understand that which they had not heard so it's a massive redemptive final stroke in history Lord that only your genius could have conceived and there's not one Christian in 10,000 who even suspects that it's coming but tonight you've given pretty good statement and so my prayer Lord is it'll not fall to the ground just to know what the eschatological conclusion of the age will be and that it's not too distant but at the door and that it's imminent and that it calls for a preparation on our part and a moral stature to bear the suffering that we shall see gives us every reason now to begin to take those steps to be a fitted and prepared people to beat to Israel what we must in their final extremity so we thank you Lord it brings us seriousness to the church that is long overdue levity and lightness fleas when the eschatological awareness of the things that complete the end the conclusion of the age the consummation is made known to us something gear shifts something takes place and it's good so thank you Lord that you have ordained that on this Pesach night Passover when Jews are in their ignorance fulfilling a kind of routine that we ourselves should be stirred to their consciousness of their coming plight and begin to fit ourselves to be to them what we would bless them where they are Lord when they break that middle matzah will your spirit reveal what it means when when they pick up that dry desiccated shank bone will you tell them that this is a symbol of him whom we have not rightly understood and celebrated thank you my God oh bless this Passover Lord and tell them about the lamb who was slain from before the foundations of the world that when his cousin John the Baptist saw him he said behold the lamb of God was come to take away the sins of the world the world needs to understand and see demonstrated before it what it has ignored or set aside and made sentimental or trivialized because this is the epical event for all the earth it is very salvation thank you Lord put it deeply in our hearts and thank you for the privilege of what you have appointed this night in Jesus holy name God's people said amen
