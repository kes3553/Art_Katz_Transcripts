Decade of the Nineties (Abridged) - Art Katz

Good morning Saints.

One of the things for which we have prayed is that because our occasions together are so few that we will enter in directly into a communion of spirit that will not require introduction or becoming acculturated to each other, to my personality, who is this guy, where is he from, what's he saying, but an instant comprehension of what the Lord is saying through me, because the time is short and we need to redeem it. So gird your loins, get serious, this is really earnest as the pastor has expressed, and many of us have heard and read and considered prophetic things and things that shall shortly come to pass, but we haven't really deeply believed that that's so, but I have never been more aware that these things are at the door and that we are at the threshold of entering into the conclusion of the age. This decade of the 90s is going to be an eternally formative time. If we have a mentality that says that one Sunday is like the next and all of our life is nothing more but a succession of services and keeping our heads above water and just going on, we're missing the whole purpose for our being and our calling in God. The church is going to be the most significant factor in the world at the conclusion of the age and through the age to the ages to come, and we're being fitted in these final times and there will be times of trial and stretching to serve the Lord in the character of the Lord himself. So there are reasons why trials and tribulations will come into the earth and not the least of it is to prepare us. So having said that much and caught your attention, I want to pray that the Lord will continue to hold it and continue to bring something through by which we ourselves will be changed and that a new seriousness will come into our lives, iron into our souls, and a resolution of what it means to be a saint and the Church of Jesus Christ in the last days.

So Lord, this is a tall order. Only you can fill it.

You see how the world has sought to cheat us from our faith and the mocking spirit yet remains that says where is the hope of his coming?

All things remain as they were. We are insulated from reality even here in this pivotal city. Things are blurred and dulled and biblical things seem remote. We are not a people living on the apocalyptic edge and we ought to be.

And I ask my God that grace of your spirit that will bring us to that consciousness and fit us and prepare us to stand and to serve. Bless this people Lord and summon your thoughts for them granting us open hearts and an understanding by the Spirit. We thank you and give you the praise for the privilege of being called to live in such an hour as this for your namesake in Jesus name God's people said amen. Well I've never done this before so I am a kind of prophetic personality but I've never been given to predictive things of what the future holds but somehow with the enormous events that have taken place in just the past few months that have shaken kingdoms and powers ideologies iron curtain countries with such devastating effect that we would be fools not to sense first the Lord's hand in that and then to ask what what does it mean and what are the implications for us. So I just want to suggest a few thoughts for your consideration and certain developments that are taking place that are already working in society and in the world but that will deepen and become more evident as we go on. So when I heard about the I've been in East Germany many times Yugoslavia I have not been in Poland I've been in Russia Czechoslovakia when I heard that the wall came down and that these regimes toppled and that the whole Marxist communist socialist system was in the process of dissolution and that was happening like that overnight I was immediately aware that this is not merely a sociological phenomenon happening of itself but God himself is the author of it. We need to be prepared for suddenness and as suddenly as these vast changes have taken place more in three months than in the 30 years or 50 years that preceded it so also will the Lord come in suddenness and so also can we anticipate other changes in suddenness and we need to be a church that is alerted and prepared and anticipates the things that shall come to pass and not be taken by surprise when they take place or astonishment or get knocked off of our pins and and be bewildered or be made insecure.

We of all people should have a handle on things more so than those in the world itself.

So what do I understand by these kingdoms toppling this whole communist socialist thing coming down and the doors opening up these great shakings first of all it provides the church with a great opportunity to evangelize in nations that have been very much closed but more than that for the first time in modern history a basis has been laid for a total world economy a major world economic and political system a global unification of the nations no longer divided along ideological lines.

This to me is the most pregnant or impressive thing that has come out of the shaking.

The communism that was the heart of the Cold War and the split between East and West has taken such a nosedive that I don't think it will ever come again to be a factor in the world that has been for now.

In a word the things have been removed that have prevented a global unification of the nations. You say what's wrong with that isn't that something to be desired?

Well if God is the author of it yes but if man is that is the very system which the scriptures have told us to despise it's called Antichrist beast system and you can be assured that the two words of our decade of the 90s will be peace and unity and who will not be suckered in by that who will not be seduced because our hearts crave for both peace and unity in a world that seems to be fragmented and unkempt and coming apart at the seams except those who have the anticipation of his coming and his kingdom that is the true peace and the true unity will be suckers and and be kept to be swept up into the false and I want to say that as we're moving toward a economic and political unity of the nations where ideology is no longer the divisive factor the very same thing is and will be happening in the religious world where doctrine is no longer the divisive matter where the doctrine that has separated major religious bodies the issues of the faith between Protestant and Protestantism and Catholicism will be sublimated and put to the side in the name of ecumenical unity anyone who has been a student of charismatic Christianity for these last decades has already seen this at play I've been on those platforms myself where men thought that by a bear hug and a backslap we were going to achieve unity with Catholic and other Episcopal and major religious bodies whose with whose doctrines we were invariants what's going to happen to that people who don't go along who seem to be an irritating obstruction to the wonderful movement toward peace and unity both economically politically and religiously you're going to be more than an irritant you're going to be an eyesore you're going to be an obstruction where we might even come to a place where men will kill us and claim they are doing God a service in a word I'm anticipating that we're going to see in this decade the alignment of the religious forces that will prevail till the end of the age the age may end by the year 2000 but if it goes on a little before that a little longer than that be assured that what happens between now and that time this 10 year period will cast the base the major and basic formation of the thing that will prevail until the coming of the Lord you're going to be required to choose and you're choosing even now though you know not conscious of it where you're going to end up in terms of the church as the great centrifugal and polarizing forces are going to move us into one camp or the other we're going to be radicalized and there's not going to be any neutral ground for those of us who don't have a stomach for that who just want to be quote ordinary Christians just get along just be a Sunday pews that are mind your business not irritate anyone and just go on I want to tell you that that option will not be to be ordained to be an ordinary Christian in this decade and at the end of the age will be to be apostate and God has never called us to be ordinary he's called us to be extraordinary he's called us to be apostolic whether you know what that word means now or not just let it register in your spirit and ask the Lord to reveal its very rich and cogent meaning I'll tell you this it's a beyond charismatic it's ultimate and was always God's intention for his church from the beginning how much more than at the end a church of apostolic glory of apostolic power of apostolic integrity of apostolic character of apostolic service these are they that turned the world upside down but these are also candidates for persecution and for martyrdom and we who have clucked our tongues at the reports of martyrdom that have come to us from distant places and iron curtain countries in Africa need to brace ourselves and to know that that's not a phenomenon confined to distant places it's a phenomenon that will always take place wherever God's people break in to a transcendent and real place with God that the world cannot tolerate and abide if we have gotten away with it it's a testimony to our shame it's the scandal of Western Christianity that it has been so timid so inoffensive so going on with its own Sunday business that the world has not been required to take note let alone to oppose it but I want to tell you that in a world that is coming to its consummation in a system that is opposed to God in its very character and nature that is anti-Christ that those who will stand for Christ and refuse to take the mark of the beast will find themselves candidates for martyrdom and if we cannot buy and sell how then shall we subsist I think that we should now begin to consider these things and God is speaking these things now so as to prepare us and to fit us for the realities that shall shortly come to pass and are already working I'm not saying thus saith the Lord but I have a suspicion that the issue of the mark of the beast or the name of the Lord in our foreheads is not a designation that is going to come to us in some final hour where we get stamped but is even now being formed day by day and moment by moment in the transactions to which we give ourselves for convenience for luxury for security in a system that is increasingly hostile and opposed to God how much attenuated to luxury are we how much do we need our security and how much are we willing to go along with it as one who has possessed an American Express card for about 20 years and paid my bills regularly never paid the 18 and a half percent exorbitant interest if you allow the debt to go beyond a month I have finally broken it up and destroyed it just felt constrained by the Lord to give it up that there is something about it that has a valence a spiritual weight a moral implication of a dependency not upon God but upon a system established by men I want to tell you it's a very naked feeling not to have that card in your wallet Gar and I have just come from overseas and we were forced down so to speak in Nairobi Africa which was only supposed to have been a plane change in route to Johannesburg from Cairo but the crummy Kenya Airlines always late four to five hours late was so again to the point where we missed our connecting flight and we had to stay overnight in a city where we had not thought to be it cost us a hundred bucks for one night and I'm not belaboring the expense God can afford it but what if we didn't have the cash it took us ten bucks to get out of the airport in a one-day visa it took us $20 each to get back in with a departure tax it took 26 bucks to get into town with a taxi cab it took the balance to get the most modest hotel we could find and what if we didn't have the cash wouldn't it be convenient to have a plastic card that is globally accepted and you can feel the warm glow of it in your back pocket and know that no matter what untoward and unexpected thing happens you have a security but I'll tell you what not to have it throws you more ruthlessly upon God and you know I've offered even my own children and my wife who have enough plastic cards to probably decorate a wall I said if you give it up I'll pay you off the balance of the debts that remain that you cannot clear you know what they're not jumping at the offer and my dear wife said well you never know when it's going to come in handy and that's exactly the point there's a whole intricate complex system that has been raised up in the world to which we have mindlessly subscribed and I suspect in my prophetic intuition that every time we give into that we condescend to it we go along with it we buy and sell in it we establish our security that we find our comfort in it something is being embossed on our forehead or on our hand and the day of the Lord will reveal what number we bear you know what's the past date about their past a church it still continues to speak the vocabulary of the faith it will still continue to use the terminology it will still call Lord Lord but the reality and the power will have long before dissipated and not only that it will be offended with that minority of the spirit that does not go along and call them heretical I'm expecting that the world is going to become increasingly vile in fact even now we ought to be vexed our souls ought to be vexed at the filth the muck the horror the sensuality the lust the brutality the power and the violence that permeates our entire culture and civilization and is lauded as good I caught a glimpse of a known whose TV set of one of these the things where they bring these monster cars together and they they have collisions and people come and pay money to see that and the guy was boasting on how terrific the crashes will be more violent more colossal more spectacular than ever before and in fact they are compelled to find something more colossal and more spectacular than ever before because there's a certain boredom in human nature we become deadened we become insensate what was at first the novelty then becomes a yawn and then they have to find increasingly cunning and new forms to titillate our senses and to engage us at the box office or to get us to turn the knob to their station these are relentless and inexorable forces working that make the world increasingly filthy and vile and its target is principally our children who constitute one of the great mass markets in modern civilization I read where a mother took two of her children rock concert and didn't get out without first paying 135 bucks the tickets themselves were enormously exorbitant but try and deny your kids and tell me can't go I'll tell you you'll have rebellion on your hands or worse and of course once they're there there's the t-shirts there's the sweatshirts there's the pins the buttons that do that's the gimmicks and the souvenirs 135 bucks listen those guys are not fools they know suckers when they see them and there's a whole mass market out there that could be manipulated and jerked by strings and parents that are too weak and too sappy to say no I wish I had a I shouldn't say which I had a buck I can't tell you how frequently that in my travels having to stay in ministerial homes usually in the bedrooms of their children do I see the rock posters that the things that are doing the walls of the children of ministers are these glitzy idols of the punkiest kind who are foul in their whole lifestyles and vocabularies so panic in their minds that's full of demonic inspiration full of luster and their eyes full of lustings and of murder and these are the idols of our generation I'll tell you what you don't have to be too clever to package any one of them you can take any jerk and turn up the amplifier and teach him a few chords and let his hair grow long and and give him a few flashy things and tight pants and a routine and you've got a mass market that the technology of culture has risen through such a crescendo that only those who are deepest in the Spirit of God and who are on guard against it can be inured to it otherwise it will be so overwhelmingly powerful and compelling who can resist it I'm thinking of the statement in Revelation who can make war with the beast who can resist the system so enormous is its power and when I think of our kids coming to Sunday school or to a church service who have been exposed to the power of that kind of culture in all of its electronic ability to listen to a man in an unaided way sharing from the Word of God you wonder how their attention can even be held and in fact it's not in many cases in most cases we need to be alerted of what is going on in the world and what we can increasingly expect and seek the Lord for the fortitude and the courage to stand against it the issue of our children may well become the issue of the cross in the terms of our obedience to the Lord and to the faith to resist the blandishments and the seductive power of this culture and civilization by saying no to our children I'm expecting an increase in violence which is already endemic it's a plague but violence of a peculiar kind senseless mindless out of proportion to the thing that provokes it that for for someone looking at you cross-eyed or beating them out on the freeway or getting a jump on them from the red from when the light changes will be enough to provoke an irrational outburst onto the onto the cruelest kind of violence there are forces working that is that are making the world increasingly impatient short fuse easy to be exploded easy to be provoked there were being encouraged to gratification and lust and and to have this now and and if we had somehow to be required to wait if our desires had to be denied if there had to be a delay of our gratification if we have to compete for space for places to live place to work how patiently will we bear that and I don't think that we're going to see patience we're going to see impatience frustration vexation exploding into anger and into violence in such a scale globally that it will threaten the order of the world it will be a kind of anarchy that will require an imposition of force that is called totalitarianism we're going to see a kind of world system that imposes order so desperate will the conditions become I'm not saying these things to scare or to panic but to prepare and to alert we need to know what time it is and that it's the Lord's very mercy to speak to us in such a way as to align ourselves with things as they in fact are and I'm not saying anything that none of us don't know but I'm putting it together by the grace of God in such a way that we might get the sense of the totality of this the all inclusiveness of this and the direction toward which it's going you know that many of us are Christians but we're really humanists at heart that if we're scratched deeply enough we believe in inevitable progress that we think that things will improve or science has the answer that is not the eschatological and apocalyptic sense of things as given in the scripture what the scriptures indicate is a winding down and a coming to the conclusion of an age that is helpless leak and incorrectly corrupt and reaches the place with that it is so vile and so beyond any hope of redemption that the only thing that can come in the protection of God's own creation is judgment how come we don't understand that how come we don't expect that because it's not pleasant to live with such thoughts our craven cowardly hearts want secretly to believe somehow it will get better we need to wise up and to know that scripturally speaking that's not what the word of God suggests are we fitted for the disintegration of the age which is not something to bring us to a forlorn condition but one of hope you see how do you mean how can you hope when you see things like that happening well doesn't the scripture say and out of the mouth of very Jesus himself when you begin to see these things look up for your redemption draweth my these are the convulsive final death gasps of the age of man coming to its conclusion but I'll tell you that something is birth being birth at the very time as this is going through its last proxies of death it is God's global peace and God's order it's called the kingdom of God and it comes with the King whom we should be expecting with deep longings for his coming is nigh look up for your salvation your redemption draweth night are you looking up I'll tell you if you're not look up you look down and that's where men's hearts will fail them for fear when they see the things that are coming upon the earth those that dwell in the earth I'm going to be raising some questions in our short days together as for example where do you dwell where do you have your citizenship are you looking up or looking down no accident that the first martyr who is a pattern for all subsequent martyrdom was looking up even as he was being stoned to death and so the heavens opened and Jesus at the right hand of God and saw the glory of God that's not a last moment's reflection it was the habitual posture of Stephen and it needs to be ours the only other alternative is to look down and our hearts will faint with fear when we see what is coming upon the earth we need now to adjust our gaze we need now to expect the things that are eternal we need not to take into consideration the things that shall shortly come to pass how much more they will be God's instruments in the fulfillment so I didn't answer my question and I didn't say this to the first service but I'll say it to you if we cannot for conscience sake and for Christ's sake submit to a beast system that requires our compromise and will not take that mark upon us how shall we live if we cannot by no sell and I think we need to begin to seek together the Lord for alternatives for sustenance and for life and not the least of these is one in which the Lord has already inducted me for these past 10 or more years namely an agriculturally based community of believers in a position to grow food to provide shelter and to sustain life and I know that many of us have shrunk from community we heard about Jim Jones and stuff like that and with one such reference we're off the hook community is a demanding and intense quality of relationship between God's people I think we're going to need that quality of relationship in order to be sustained in a world where iniquity abounds and the love of many shall grow cold Mia Sunday services punctuated by a midweek Bible study will not be enough we're going to have to again be apostolic go from house to house breaking bread we need each other in a frequency and intimacy and depth that the world has taught us to fear and so long as we're going to be that close maybe we ought to be it in places where we can grow food raised chickens and and other kinds of things that will sustain life not only for ourselves but refugees from the system who will be cast out of it and will need to be taken in and to be suffered I would much rather see a church not talk about its building programs and it's glass the feet rules but begin to take its funds and look for some kind of rural property at the perimeter of the cities where they are and begin to take the first steps in learning how to live together because it will be a provision both for sanctity as well as for life how do you like them apples I had the interesting experience of spending a day with a Jewish brother on the farm when we first went up there we were stringing Bob wire imagine a Jewish nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn stringing Bob wire never had done it before and I we came back at the end of that day filthy splattered with blood sweat exhausted torn you know this brother said to me as we turned in he said I already said I've known you for years at conferences and and conventions and meetings and Christian service and I've never known you so well as I do on this one day working together I want to tell you this things that there are realms of joy and meaning available to us in fellowship that we need to find that goes far beyond the sitting of alongside each other in pews and because we have not voluntarily sought this apostolic mode of life God is going to turn up the heat and compel us out of circumstance to find it because we'll not be able to enjoy a continued privatistic lifestyle of individual households and cars and insurance and all of the kinds of things that make us enslaved to the system but need to find ways to simplify our lives and to extricate ourselves and find an alternative modes of living that might prove not only our sustenance and survival but for others just a suggestion not of us say if the Lord you know if we go on like that to become that serious our light is going to shine and it's not presently shining we're nice we're polite where we've got it together to a degree but there's a radiance of God that I believe is going to characterize the remnant Church of God at the end of the age in extreme contradiction to the increasing darkness and gloom that pervades the earth which of us does not want a radiant face shining with God and I'll tell you what the ones that really have it I'm not even an aware are aware that they look like that they just simply have it and in fact if we were self-conscious about that spirituality it would not be a true life it's the statement of our greater intimacy and truer knowledge of the Lord that does not come cheaply nor easily and I'll tell you what though it might be a blessing it's also going to be an invitation perhaps for our destruction by those who cannot tolerate the light I anticipate persecution and martyrdom even before this decade is out and it will not take place in remote and distant places but very close to home wherever the light of God shines so profoundly that the dark world cannot abide to tolerate it and to see it I shared with the first service that even as a young believer newly saved former Jewish atheist and ex-Marxist radical returning to the high school in California where as a history teacher to take up my place with colleagues all of whom rejected me on my first night back because of my conversion and sitting down one day in the teachers cafeteria having lunch with a Jewish woman to whom I had been witnessing who was having an affair with another man seeing a psychiatrist and popping pills and this time the Lord had me silent I wasn't saying over just quietly eating my lunch totally inoffensive and I can feel waves of anger and hatred billowing out of this woman taught me it was crackling and I looked up at her she was almost foaming at the mouth and finally she couldn't contain herself she slapped her fork down she said even when you're silent she said you're a living accusation that's going to be a statement of our witness to a world that is Christ rejecting if we ourselves have been ruthlessly and radically separated from its values and its lifestyle and its mode of being that means a more searching and radical quality of separation than anything we before would have considered and there's no word for it other than painful it's going to be the issue of the cross it's going to be the issue of submitting our priorities to God it's going to be the issue that though we have the bucks in our wallet does not automatically endorse what we think we can do with it as legitimate I just want to tell you what kind of a foolish guy I am just because I got a few bucks in my pocket does not mean I can go in and indulge myself for a Whopper hamburger or a this or a that though my flesh would like it I really have to submit the question to God it's not what I'm able to do it's what he's willing that I should we need to bring ourselves into a greater discipline in things that we think now are harmless and what difference does it make if you indulge yourself a little more after all don't you have it coming haven't you worked hard don't you deserve a break and it is that very mentality that explains the scandal of the Jimmy Bakers and the other and Jimmy Swaggart's who think they've got it coming and therefore they can put their feet up and enjoy their gold-plated bathroom fixtures and their $250,000 fences around the 1.5 million dollar palatial residences because they have it coming I want to tell you we have nothing coming I want to tell you that we've been brought with a price I want to tell you that we have been brought back from the dead to live no longer unto ourselves but unto him we need to disabuse ourselves and rid ourselves of these filthy mucky worldly generalizations and self justifications and make us candidates for apostasy in this decade into which we're moving there's a radicalizing place process taking place and mark my words we'll find ourselves either a apostate or apostolic and there'll be no neutral ground in between so Christian community of a creative productive food producing shelter providing and life-sustaining kind however much dreaded by many till now will prove one of the few if only viable alternatives to being enslaved to the system we need to find the creative and Holy Ghost alternatives for a people who are willing to launch out and give up their securities and dependencies in the world by the very gracious and gentle process of God for the just shall live by their faith if the bottom falls out now would you come unglued would you panic who is presently providing now your support is it some corporation or agency of the federal government or is that only an instrumentality which God is presently using but when he doesn't use that he can use Ravens just as well how do you see how do you perceive the issues of your life in your security does it come from man and from institutions from the world or from God that is your faith in him can you live by the quality of faith you have and if your faith is only shallow superficial charismatic as it were are you willing from this day and from these days to be moved increasingly to an apostolic and radical faith in God that will be the issue not only of your survival but your witness knowing that it ain't going to be easy but why should it be easy isn't the cross the symbol of our faith isn't it the place of suffering and pain and shame and public opposition my God what has happened to subvert that at the torpedo that that the cross has only become a harmless little decoration around our neck around our walls we need to be restored to the faith once and for all given the Saints because it will determine not only how we're going to end up in this age but how we're going to end eternally and that church that does not take eternity into consideration will surely collapse under the pressures of the immediacy of this temple world order only those who see the things that are invisible and eternal will count their afflictions momentary in light in the view of the invisible weight of glory that awaits them eternally you have that sense of reward I wouldn't expect it you would I don't know that I have it but I'll tell you what the scriptures speak of it we need to expect it and it needs to be so compelling for us that it eclipses the kinds of seductive things that are vying for our attention and our loyalty and our worship even now excuse the language I get fancy once in a while the genius of apostolicity I know what if I don't do anything else for you may you love that word apostolic may you drool over it may you not know exactly what it means but you know it's where the action is and everything that's true about the faith once and for all given the Saints centers in that word and that if we are not an apostolic and prophetic people in our very constituency and character what are we but a bunch of apostate pews that is who are going along with the world and don't want to be inconvenienced but the genius of apostolicity is its eschatological that's a Greek root that means sense of the things pertaining to the end and end time people who know that we are at the end of the age and called for such a timelessness and not be mourning I'll say how come me why could I have been a Christian in an easier time the privilege of finishing this age to his honor and to his glory as even now we are encircled about by a cloud of invisible witnesses who are not complete without us do you have that sense do you see yourself an unbroken continuum with the historic past of the faith and the glorious future for which the Saints have always looked I think some of you may need to get saved again today or converted the genius of this apostolicity is its eschatological and apocalyptic expectancy not apocalyptic means a sudden intrusion of God a climactic end in a collision of kingdoms in sparks and fury and violence and out of it the coming of the Lord to vindicate his faithful Saints who have patiently endured until the end those that are dead in Christ and they didn't die of old age will rise first and those who remain that is who have survived a time of severe tribulation will rise with them I don't know how that squares with your theology but I just want to announce that's only fair for you to know and you can hear it I have never subscribed to a pre tribulation rapture yes the church is going to meet him in the air but when and in what condition so those who endure to the end do so in the hope of eternal reward henceforth Paul says in 2nd Timothy 4 8 and I'll conclude with this there is laid up for me the victors crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me and recompense me on that great day I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that that phrase is not in your vocabulary that you never speak about the day of the Lord the day of his judgment the day of his appearing and yet the scriptures are prolific with that reference in every apostolic writer the day of the Lord the day is at hand the day the day the day why don't we think that way why don't we expect it in the day on that great day and not to me only but also to all those who have loved and yearned and welcomed his appearing some state recently said I'm not ready that he should come I just got my new hi-fi I just got promoted I want to enjoy my new home I've got a vacation I'm not ready you know delay but I tell you what every day that he delays how many more abortions how many more molestations how many more freakings out how many more murders how many acts of violence how many vile filthy and degrading things how many more abductions of our children right off the street we're going to yearn for and look for the day of his appearing and seeing these things what manner of men ought we to be hasting the day of the Lord's appearing this is not some fixed chronological thing that we can lean on our haunches and go about and do our thing and play with our games and the Lord will come when it's all chronologically scheduled it's waiting on something a prepared end time remnant people who will rule and reign with the soon-coming King and right now we can't even blow our own noses rule and reign over his creation in the character of the lamb himself when will we be fitted for that if not now in the real issues of the church that are more than should we change the carpet or invite a speaker paint the building are you judging the church are you judging that those that are in sin are you willing for the enormous strain and demand of being to church which is our school for eternity I will welcome his appearing because when he comes our persecution ends although he allows the enemy to be drunk with the blood of the prophets the Apostles and the Saints I'll tell you that's more than a little sip and I would be foolish to deny that there's they've got to be just by any rational reckoning people in this audience right now who are intended in that modest fulfillment you may not understand this I don't know if I'll talk about it again it's more than just the mindless loss of the life of the Saints something is performed in the sacrifice of the precious lives of his Saints that he allows that works of works works of work and makes a demonstration and the principalities to the principalities and the powers of the air that ousts them and compels them to vacate the places that you have they have usurped and by which they have horrendously maligned and worked against the purposes of God and the earth and releases creation from their terrible bondage that comes with the demonstration of the character of God through his people in severity and suffering you can understand why I'm not a popular charismatic speaker but I believe I'm doing God's service to speak to things that we have every reasonable right to expect and that are shortly to come to pass and I'll tell you what if we have been prepared for more of them and it should not be required what have we lost but that we have gained an epistolic character a stature a determination a purity and quality of life that will serve us in good stead throughout the ages to come the issue of modernism is not some last moment sucking of our breath and finding some hope for courage it's the sum total and the logic of all the moments that have preceded it by which we had always lived as those whose lives are not their own who do not hold their lives as dear unto themselves how many of you this morning would say Lord whatever it takes but artists describing that remnant people that brilliant last day's witness and even are required not only to suffer but to give their blood I want to be part of that save me from the eternal scandal and shame that I should find myself Christ denying and be in the great multitude of the apostate who scorn and oppose this true church whatever it takes my God to fit me to stand I open myself and ask come on teach me the disciplines of the faith tighten the screws break my dependencies and my habits my lusts and my desires for like Easter that I would think that I'm going to die if I don't have it open to me the issues of eternity as being more real than the things that are seen break my eyeballs away from the earth in my ears from all of their filthy electronic devices simplify and purify I want to be an unbroken continuum with the invisible cloud of witnesses and have a crown and eternal reward waiting me is that your prayer stand up if it is I didn't do this this morning and I'm not doing it now God is and I'll tell you what your standing will affect everything in all the days to come and even these days we're going to hear something deeper from God he's now free to give us without restraint what he would otherwise have been denied if you saw that we were too cowardly and did not want the full measure this is an enormous standing for anybody's having second thoughts you would be better to sit than this and to stand mindlessly because there's a crowd doing it this standing means you welcome from the Lord whatever is required to establish you as a true saint to the end of the age one who will endure overcome and not fall precious God in Jesus name I myself I'm surprised by the way you've expressed yourself to this second congregation but you know my God every single soul you know the end from the beginning you know what's before us my God you know where we presently are you know what we need I've never heard you talk more earnestly more seriously more unsparingly to your saints as if we are already true sons and daughters you're not babying us anymore you've allowed us to go through that baby stage it's time now to grow up and come of age and Lord I ask you to seal by name every single soul that has stood that they should not murmur they should not complain and not think of a strange thing for the fiery trials that shall come that you'll remind them didn't you stand didn't you invite this that your faith might come out as pure as gold refined by the fire why now are you complaining because you have marital stress or where you lost your job or your security or this happened in your body you invited me in my wisdom and love to meet out what was needful to fit you to stand and I'm going to do it and not only for you individually but corporately this church this body this expression of the Lord is going to be a palpable real and significant statement of God in this community and beyond that and Lord we pray those things and we thank you for the high calling in Christ Jesus change our cowardly hearts give us apostolic courage by your spirit teach us my God to tap the grace of God grace upon grace for we know that we cannot in our own strength my God do these things help us from where we presently are to bring us I bless these children I bless this congregation in the name of Jesus and ask your continuing blessing with us in these days till you will have left such a deposit that will reverberate to the day of eternity seal this now seal this transaction prepare our hearts to hear and to
