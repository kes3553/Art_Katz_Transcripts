The Church and the Synagogue 1 of 4 - Art Katz

Lord, we bless You, precious God.

We tremble even while we're confident that You are the Lord over all, that we have come to an historic moment in the unfolding history of the Church, Your glory, Your body, Your bride, that there's something, my God, that is to issue from You from this moment for which our previous moments were preparation, that is an on-time thing of a kind beyond our own ability to assess.

How shall we proceed, Lord?

You've made us so exceedingly conscious of our frailty, and yet You've charged us with such enormous participation, responsibility. It's a contradiction, my God, of an uttermost kind, the paradox, that out of our earthen lips Your words, my God, should issue.

So let it come and let it flow forth, my God, and grant us open ears, open hearts to hear, to consider what has never before been set before the Church to my knowledge that is now on time. And we will hold every syllable that issues from Your heart, from the throne of Heaven, my God, with such respect, such reverence.

We'll not be quick to condemn, to judge, to critique. We'll just hold it. We'll let it richly dwell in our hearts. We'll let it speak to us and form us and change us.

So come, precious God, we cherish Your Word.

It's what You, Yourself, are in Yourself. You are the Word.

So grant us the present truth as it now is in Christ Jesus, and we'll be careful to not allow a syllable to fall to the floor. Thank You for this privileged time, Lord.

Again, I confess before Your people and before You, as You know best, I don't even know how to proceed.

So come and unfold Your great heart by Your own power, and we might give You all praise and honor and glory and acknowledgement, for it will be visible and clear that very God is the one who is expressing and bringing forth. Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Lord. In Jesus' name, Amen. Well, the hour has struck.

I have before me a remarkable theological work by a Jewish scholar, Mark Nanos, N-A-N-O-S, called The Mystery of Romans. And there's such a volume of commentary on Romans. Just last, yesterday evening, I took out of my own shelves five different commentaries just to check how other responsible theologians handled one single verse out of Romans 15, where it speaks about the sacrifice of the Gentiles, very unusual phrase, not anywhere else expressed in all Scripture and in all of the writings of Paul, and disappointed to find that maybe three or four out of the commentaries completely omit any reference to it, which is not unusual even among the best of God's scholars, where they just don't know, they just pass it by. And that's true also of the whole remarkable thing with which we began, namely Noah and his sons and the episode of Noah's Drunkenness has very little commentary to be found by Christian scholars. Of course, Jewish Talmudists have a lot to say of a very highly imaginative kind, very speculative, that you have to receive without understanding, but rich. So, this man's thesis is stunning and utterly radical. The remarkable thing, I believe, is that this book won for him the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish-Christian Relations. Isn't that a remarkable commendation? And having given him that award, I suspect that they themselves did not understand the magnitude and the depth of what this brother was touching. Chapter 13 of Romans has always been, 13 through 15, 13 especially, a conundrum for Christian scholars that how could Paul commend to the Church a submission to the authorities that be? After all, Rome was a pagan civilization, Nero, its emperor, was one of the worst persecutors of the Church, and Paul is commending submission to those authorities? This author, as I hope I have occasion to quote and show, says that that is one of the most tragic misunderstandings of Paul that have caused a dark blot over the history of modern times, because when it comes to the Hitler period, the German Church sanctions or approves or submits to the authority of the Nazi regime validating that by what Paul has expressed in Romans 13, that somehow we ought to submit to the authorities that are above us, and that the Nazi regime is that authority because all government is of God and instituted for our welfare, and that this was a mistake of the most colossal proportions. Had the Nazi regime been opposed, especially by the Church, and especially in its first instances of repression against the Jew, the annihilation of the six million Jews might have never taken place. There are other reasons why I would say that it had to take place. Nevertheless, the question is a valid one. So then what is Paul alluding to? To what authority is he commending the Gentile believers in Rome to submit? This is a great question for us because Rome is not just another location. Rome is the New York City of the diasporic world. Diaspora is Jews in exile, Jews who have been propelled out from the land and that Rome has become the nexus and the seat of urbane city, life, and existence which Jews so much enjoy and wish they had so much figured throughout modern times that today's Rome would be New York City as an enclave of Jewish life, power, and influence in publishing, in commerce, in finance, in culture, newspapers, publications, editing, publishing, films, and in religion. So one of the questions we need to consider once we understand what this commentator says Paul is getting at, what is the application for today? The fact that I'm in New York now, for those of you who don't know it, I'm here on leave. The call that I now have that came about six months ago in a dramatic and utterly supernatural way right here at Ben Israel in the morning prayer time was to cease from my activity to the church and to move to New York and to make myself available to the Jewish community there. We felt that that was an historic moment for us and that it was the fulfillment or the beginning fulfillment of a vision that had come to us in a dream 25 or 30 years before that ended with my coming into New York City, that began with my first, the dream opens up on the top of a mountain walking with a brother whose face is somehow obscured to me, maybe symbolic of all brothers with whom I have been walking and we're following a figure some hundreds of yards in front of us in a sensitive having to watch carefully how he moves because if you miss him for a moment you might go off the way and that somehow we just catch him at a final moment when he seems to turn down and we then make that descent and by such a process come to the bottom of that mountain and stand at its base and there the base itself are like great granite stones not sculpted by hands, natural but yet somehow remarkably squared and moss covered indicating antiquity. We were at the very foundation of the mount which is the kingdom of God and following the Lord, that figure, all through the years down to that mountain we have come now to its base and by that time I was alone, I don't know what happened to the brother with whom I commenced that journey or the brothers with whom I have been walking but they were outside the picture as I'm looking up to the heights from which I have come which by the way were not peaked but domed because a domed mountain is a more ancient mountain than a peaked mountain, did you know that? So this is the ancient of days himself somehow over what we have been traversing all through the years in obscurity and hiddenness, many people who remember me as the Jewish hot shot of the early full gospel charismatic days who faded from view as God brought us to Nowheresville in Minnesota has all to do that obscurity and hiddenness is part of the following of the Lord where so ever he shall lead us and so I'm looking up at the top from where I have come and great boulders begin to come off the top and upon me and I'm looking up like innocently and they are just falling harmlessly about me, great massive stones calculated for my destruction and then there is one last stone and as they say in our contemporary culture it had my name on it or my number on it I was a goner, I looked up I knew I was finished and at that last moment I hear a voice, watch out and I took one small step and the thing missed me you can consider in your spirits whether that boulder has yet come, I hope so or it has yet to come or it's just a symbol of the kinds of dangers that are appropriate to the call and from that point on, on that plateau there was a moving escalator and I found myself on it and I'm moving toward a building where I know I am to receive a shower I never do see that scene but I know that I have to pass through that building and I'm on the escalator, there are here and there are some others on it, I'm not quite alone but I'm the only one required to take off all my clothing, talk about nakedness and fold it neatly, which is not like me, ask anger and to put it down before me and put an object on top of it which I assumed is a bible the next scene is I'm coming out of that building, never having seen the shower but knowing that I had received it, a cleansing of some necessary kind and I'm in New York City, clearly, unmistakably, New York and I'm in the thick of a crowd, which New York is, they say it's a city that never sleeps it's always bumper to bumper traffic and there are a number of Jews with Van Dyke beards they are evidently orthodox but they're not their common orthodox as we say in New York, they're not a schlach, probably is an equivalent German word for this orthodox, they're not your common yellow stained beard type but men, nicely trimmed, a sense not only of deep spirituality but deep intellectuality and somehow I find myself in conversation with these men and they're offering me a lift and the next scene is I'm in their limousine and we're going through the streets of New York and we pass, I think, the Greyhound bus terminal I say, weren't you going to drop me off here like I'd rendezvous with the brother with whom the dream commenced oh, we'll bring you back there another time, Art and somehow that satisfies me and I never do stop the next scene is Brooklyn, New York, the place of my birth streets that are familiar to me and I'm sitting on the sidewalk with these Jewish people it's like turning the clock back to the depression years because we're sitting on those simple folded wooden chairs and kibitzing, you know, as Jews do sitting on the stoop, sitting on chairs, schmoozing, kibitzing and there's a sense of being so accepted by them that there's nothing about me that in any way alienates them there's almost an instant cordiality and acceptance and we're just talking and I'm telling them I think I need a haircut, you know, the one who would give a haircut oh yes, the Rebbetzin gives haircuts, the rabbi's wife the next thing I know, I don't see this in the dream, I have received a haircut the final scene, the next conclusion of the dream I'm in a candy store, the typical Brooklyn corner candy store the only thing that is untypical is that every fixture has been removed including the light fixtures and I'm sitting on the barren floor knowing that it had been a candy store without a case, without a counter, without stools with the children of this Jewish community and we're sitting and playing and carrying on with them in the dark but sufficient illumination to see each other and one of the kids gives me his father's card who is a rabbi, a black card and the letters are in pale yellow the same pale yellow in which the Jews had to wear a star on their clothing to identify them as Jews in the ghettos and in the concentration camps and it had the address of the synagogue, I knew the location and I know that there's no synagogue at that location so I don't know what that means and then the final scene is, I'm back together with this little community of Orthodox Jews we're crossing the street, Avenue U where I was lost as a kid and found in a police station when my mother was in the girdle store and I didn't have patience to wait so I know this neighborhood and one of these Jewish men turns to me as we're crossing the street and he said, from where are you now coming? and I said to him, in fact I had just come back from Africa on a trip and I was just going to turn to him and tell him, well I've just returned from Africa and I couldn't even mouth another word as if someone had pulled the plug out from the wall I lost the power even to communicate a simple piece of information and it's so frightening that I walked from my dream and then it was prayer time at Ben Israel and it ended just in time to get ready to go down to the prayer meeting and as I'm walking I'm saying, Lord, is this something for me personally or is this something to be shared with the whole Ben Israel community? and he impressed me to share it we spent the entire morning interpreting the dream one of the brothers interpreted the haircut as God giving me a new framework of understanding that had to do with the mind and a grasping and an understanding of things especially as it pertained to a law that would enable me to communicate the Jews within their own context and yet to bring an application of it in a way they would never have conceived so that was the symbolic meaning of haircut but one thing was clear, however we interpret the various things the issue was New York that the day would come when that would be the focal point of our entire life and being and that day has come with the call that came six months ago at Ben Israel in the prayer meeting when I brought down my introduction to a booklet that you'll find on the table called Chosen for What a brother, Mike Snyder, who has just been miraculously healed from cancer being given only three months to live and would not submit himself to any operation if God would heal him fine, if not he was ready to be taken he was healed and Mike called or wrote and said I have a burden from the Lord that a booklet should be composed for Jewish readers in New York and that you're the ones to do it and I'll finance the entire project including the thousands of dollars necessary to advertise it in the New York Times and so we looked to the Lord and I began to write an introduction and that particular morning I put the introduction down to the prayer meeting to begin to read it and share it and get some feedback and pray for this project, this significant project I was hardly into the first or second paragraph of that introduction when I found myself sobbing and weeping convulsively and in the same moment it seemed like the whole atmosphere thickened with the presence of God and I don't know quite how to describe it when such a visitation from God comes I would say probably the most prominent visitation in our whole almost 30 year history in this place the Lord filled the room with his presence and people also began to weep and come out of their seats in prayer and in prophecy and before that glorious smoke cleared the Lord made the statement you are to cease from your activity to the Church I just come back from Macedonia and Bulgaria and ten cities of the Ukraine, Russia, Wales and England and before that I've been in Chile and Brazil and before that here in Albania and places and places and places you are to cease from your activity to the Church and the world you know what that's like saying? you are to cease your existence, your reason for being and move to New York and make yourself available to the Jewish community there, no strategy, no program, no how to, just be present and so that's where we are so the Jews in New York, or the Jews per se are not just another ethnic group they are the chosen people of God whose destiny is not yet fulfilled and if the Church is not aware of that destiny the powers of darkness are and want to blot out any possible fulfillment that they should return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord releasing the King and the Kingdom as we have spoken already in these days so they have become again now the central object of God's concern and of course the Church is that agency in the earth created by Him for the purposes that pertain to their redemption but a Church of what kind? Church of an ultimate kind for they represent the most ultimate challenge that can come to the Church and that history is not in our favor the pogroms, the expulsions, the forced exiles, the forced conversions the wholesale slaughter and death and sometimes the entire Jewish community's death at their own hand if you know anything about medieval history and the Crusades you know that even in my favorite town in Germany Esslingen near Stuttgart if anyone knows that geography where today the Church in Esslingen stands was at one time in the 12th century the synagogue of the Jewish community because since 70 A.D. and the destruction of Rome and the expulsion of Jews into the Holy Roman Empire numbers of them were brought into what is today's Germany and had a 2,000 year existence in that land and so when the Crusaders came they financed their journey to the Holy Land by looting the Jewish communities pillaging, raping, looting, threatening and so Jews knowing of that threat locked themselves up in their own synagogue which was put to the torch and the entire community went up in flames some four, eight centuries before the flames of Dachau and Auschwitz and other places Jews took the lives of their own children cut their throats and their wives and then each other so that when the doors finally burst down with the Crusaders with their crosses on their chest coming in to have their loot and their rape they found the entire community dead and steeped in their own blood there's a Hebrew phrase that is translated sanctifying the name of the Lord Kiddush Hashem they felt that the taking of their own lives which of course is murder the German word Selbstmord self-murder indicates that this is not something that we can perform at will it's as much in God's sight a crime against his creation as if we were taking the life of another but in this case to avoid forced conversion because it was either converting or dying they chose to die but they died in fact for his name because what did that conversion represent? but the vacating and the forsaking of their ancient faith to adopt the religion of these hounds that were baying for their death as our brother described the other day dogs forming at the mouth bound to chains waiting to break and to release it to have their victims they should convert to that religion so that's the history we have and don't think that my Rabbi Bumenfield for whom I ask your prayer and if you want to see his dear face it's on this table here this precious man whom God has given me in my stay in New York I meet with him every Wednesday you can pray from 2 p.m. till 6 or 7 where we have remarkable encounters together there's not a time when he doesn't remind me that I've joined myself to a heretical sect that is pagan and Greek in its origin that is totally un-Hebraic and that in the name of whose founder Jews have suffered unbelievable horror I have every week to meet this accusation and to try to find somewhere to answer it but even as we've had a preliminary time here before you came it was made clear to us that I cannot say to him, well dear Rabbi, I do not identify with those were not Christians these were unregenerate Gentiles the fact that they wore a cross on their tunics does not establish the reality of what they were about they were religionists at best or just Gentiles who were a soldier becomes when you're recruited you're enlisted into a religion it could have been anything that was called Christianity and Jews were its victims but that doesn't cut water with him that doesn't impress him that I cannot disassociate myself that I see myself coming out of another Christian tradition more Anabaptist than conventional but I'm identified and that's one of the great stigmas that bar communication between us so that's only one of the many things I went to my Saturday morning session in Brooklyn at the Lubavitcher headquarters in Crown Heights Brooklyn you may have heard of their Rabbi whose name is Schneerson who died in 91 and whose resurrection is being awaited by a great number of them because they believe that he himself is the Messiah because he exhibited such extraordinary gifts of intellectuality and spirituality that could there be another and that his death was an astonishment though it came in his own 90th years and they're awaiting his resurrection well this has become a scandal in Orthodox Judaism and a Rabbi who is also a professor of history at Queen's College has written a book to alert the Jewish community worldwide that the Lubavitcher facetum this Brooklyn community awaiting the resurrection of their Rabbi as Messiah are treading a dangerous ground that virtually they are on Christian grounds because they believe that an earthly man could be the Messiah and even very deity and God and that we can await his resurrection because his earthly ministry is not yet fulfilled is almost a page out of Christian doctrinal understanding and that all that needs happen now is for Jewish consideration to be turned from Schneerson to Jesus and so this Rabbi professor is alerting the Jewish community of this dangerous new line of thinking that has taken place with the death of this notable Rabbi so here I am in the midst of this ferment going on within Jewish orthodoxy itself and I was attending a Saturday morning teaching session if you can imagine a man with his jaw agape drinking in every word that's a picture of myself at that session and it was reading the commentary of one of the great sages of their movement and his commentary on the Torah selections for the Shabbat week and just rich in all kinds of symbolic and spiritual meanings can you believe that we can receive something from their table? that can be spiritually edifying? one of the scandals of last summer the very last session of last year's convocation is when I came to the session with a text without any explication the text was Jesus at the well in Samaria, the woman at the well and I said I'm going to give you guys an opportunity to enter in to a prophetic dimension by not bringing it to you as something that I have already attained but that if I attain it, I will attain it with you right now as we examine this text for the first time it was altogether a prophetic experience and so the Lord is opening up the implications as for example, we've come full circle Jews had averted Samaria because the Samaritans were a mixed bag they were half Jewish, they were half Gentile it was unclean, it was impure they were considered untouchables they should be avoided for Jesus to come through Samaria and to be found at the well was an astonishment as we know from the statement of the woman how can a Jew ask of me water? because what have you Jews to do with us Samaritans we're unclean in your sight so she was astonished not only at Jesus' presence as a visible Jew but that he was willing to receive of her water and then he makes the remarkable statement if you knew who it was who asks of you water to drink you would ask of him and he would give you such water as you would not again be thirsty how can you draw she said seem that you have no vessel with you and so begins the remarkable dialogue that ends not only with her salvation but that of the entire community and so the Lord was suggesting if we were not too imaginative that now the issue is not a Samaritan woman whom the Jews have been avoiding but the Jew whom the church has been avoiding that we have been circumventing these people who are sort of out of view and they're questionable in what they are about and what they believe but it's time now to come into their Samaria and to come to their well and not only to come to their well but to draw water from their well so what I suggested that there's yet something to be had of a spiritual kind from Jacob's well and it's deep and that in fact I wondered this is the kind of liberty that we prophetic men take I wondered if the waters of life are somehow restricted to us in the exact measure that we are willing to humble ourselves and to receive from the depths of that well and when I made that statement a Jewish sister cried out you've gone too far now this is heresy something like that so what's been happening to me in New York in these six months is I've been drinking from Jacob's well and I can tell you that there's graphs there to be had that we have not imagined that are a vast benefit to us in the faith and if we have a sufficient confidence that we are in the faith we can drink from that well we can relate to these Samaritans without fear of loss of our scriptural doctrinal purity in fact the whole history of Venezuela, my own personal history has been the use of God to touch movements and peoples that have been outside the pale in the traditional evangelical understanding who will one day have a destiny for the fulfillment of the mystery of Israel okay let's take a look at the principal text that we're going to examine that gives us opportunity to see the radical thesis suggested by this Jewish commentator on Romans chapter 13 where he says that Christian scholars because of their lack of identification with Israel and with the Jew have thought that Paul was meaning secular society the society that celebrates the emperor as God what a conundrum, how could Paul the great apostle and the Pharisee of the Pharisees in the Hebrew of the Hebrews commend to Gentile Christians that they should submit to authorities that celebrate a Caesar and an emperor as God and nevertheless what other way is there to understand because in the superficial reading it seems like he's addressing to the authorities of secular society but the thesis of this man is that you have missed it because you have not read and understood Paul in his Jewish context you have required of him and brought to him your own Gentilic framework of understanding so as we read this I'm asking you to consider that Paul is not inviting Gentile Christians in Rome to submit to the secular authorities of Rome but to submit to the religious authorities of the synagogue because the Gentile believers were looked upon by Jews traditional Jews not yet Christ receiving as righteous Gentiles and if they were to embrace the one faith of the God of Israel they would come to it through their relationship in the synagogue and we know from other scriptures that Moses is read every week every Shabbat in the diasporic communities throughout the ancient world and Godly, God-fearing they were either called righteous Gentiles or the God-fearers would come to the synagogue and be accepted and received by Jews that they might have access to the reading of the scriptures and the commentaries of the rabbis and just the precious environment that Jews have known throughout the generations and that exists to this day one of the quandaries that I have to face is now bringing myself to the synagogues and seeing the piety that is not feigned or imagined that is not religious or cultural how do I factor that in? How do I understand that? That they can have a visible seeming proximity to God that are yet outside the pale, are yet not crossed the divide, have not yet come into the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and yet their devotion they're looking to the ark that the Saturday morning when they had brought the Torah out from its ark and parted the curtains and bring it down the central aisle of that synagogue with a thousand men with their talit over their heads and it's an awesome sight and come up on the platform and at one point hold it up everyone to see the open Torah people kissing it as it passes them with their talits I know religion and I've seen religion more in charismatic circles that is more human than Godly but I have to say when I observe that I'm impressed with the depth and the authenticity of it that is not feigned, that is not religious, that is not cultural but seems to give evidence of some real sense of God either it's a mercy of God or as I was sharing with Reggie a week or so ago I found the scripture by accident in Ezekiel 11, I hope I can find it again in which he says I will be a little sanctuary to you in your exile so even in this interim even in this time when your eyes are blinded when the veil is yet over your understanding where the dent of history where Satan has had such sway to poison and corrupt the name of Jesus for your consideration that you cannot conceivably call upon him or even consider him as my Rabbi's wife said when I was brought to their home for the first time she said I cannot even consider as an Orthodox Jewish woman anything to do with this Jesus or this New Testament, I have never read a word in it, I've never considered anything about it, I don't even understand why my husband continues with you he almost had to force her to sit down at the same table with me and be cordial and so I said to her dear lady what shall I tell you, I wasn't even looking for God or for him but what do you do when a book comes into your hands and the central figure of that book says if you see him you see the father I and the father are one and allows a doubting Thomas to touch his wounds and cry out my Lord and my God and he doesn't rebuke him and I went on like that every time I quoted the scripture she was hearing it for the first time I was quoting New Testament scriptures either out and off of Jesus or about Jesus and I watched her visibly jerk with each statement hearing it for the first time because I was in her home because I was seeing her husband weekly because the Lord had opened that door because I was faithful to go to New York at the Lord's behest because I didn't lift the finger to establish the relationship with that man and it cannot be broken the next morning when she had to go to the Hebrew school she's a teacher and say goodbye to me her whole face had changed and she came to say, she looked so much sweeter and I said to Esther, my mother's name Esther be patient the time is not too distant though it seems to you that we are inextricably opposed that the day will come when we will both of us be rejoicing in God together so excuse me for my little biographical details but they are to encourage your heart and I never did finish that I came again to that Lubavitcher center to the Saturday morning teaching before the service in which my jaw was agape and I came with Dan Shield one of our original Ben Israelites whose wife called me and said Dan's birthday is coming up and what he desires more than anything else to visit you in New York and we want to send him as a birthday gift I said send him Dan is Gentile of the Gentiles blonde, blue eyed light complexed I took him with me to this morning's teaching and when it was over the two teachers one is a doctor and the other is a financier with Oppenheimer securities deeply secular men in their professions but deeply Godly men in their spirituality and they were just expositing commentary of this great sage and showing its nuances and going back and forth one to the other something like the interplay between us here and as much as we were the most Dan and I were our mouths open drinking it up when it was over they came up to us and they said we forbid you to come again and to sit at this table so long as you believe in Jesus I said what I said we're not at all promoting any cause we're not seeking to convert we just want to be present and enjoy and receive the benefit of this very rich instruction no so long as you believe in him we forbid you to come because he was the man of lies and he was the man of sin and his miracles like walking in the water on the water he learned from us and used it to turn his own Jewish kismet away from the law in the following of him he was a deceiver and they go down like that I had never heard such poisonous diatribe in my life against Christ and he said and we knew these things and we have them in our Talmud but we were required to remove them because from about the time of Luther when there was a renaissance in the interest of Hebrew Christian scholars could themselves read the Talmud and that's why Luther later on when he became bitter against the Jews called for the burning of the Talmud and the destruction of the synagogues because it was they were promulgating such what's the word anti-Christ sentiment of such a vile kind that he was afraid that as more Christians were coming under rabbinical Jewish influence it would actually blight the Reformation itself but I had never heard this diatribe right in my own teeth so that's where it stands it's remarkable that in Rome and throughout the Roman Empire the only other religious body that Roman authorities acknowledged as valid and did not dispute or disturb was the synagogue isn't that remarkable? everyone else had to bow to their Caesar to their Emperor to worship of man but Jews were allowed to continue not only were they allowed to continue but the synagogue was not only a center of religious practice it was a place of civil administration Jews watched over their own community which has been a fact right till this day that in my first visit to Egypt before I was a believer in the process of becoming a believer in 1963 perhaps yes 1963 I was a representative of a Jewish museum in California to the Jewish communities of Alexandria and Cairo and in both places I came not just to a synagogue I came to a community they had a place for the distribution of clothing they had food for the poor they had medical aid for the aged they had a program for poverty they had education for the children the Hebrew school, the secular school every aspect of life was overseen and performed out of the central bureau that the synagogue was in that community where this is our churches have not this function in America it's hard for us even to imagine this kind of relationship and I think the Romans took advantage of this diasporic reality by which Jews governed Jews and their being in exile in other nations by not only seeing to their religious continuance but also to the other aspects of their civil life so gentiles were welcomed into this framework and so it was not just a rabbi who drones on or chants the portion of the Torah but that the synagogue officials were civil magistrates they had authority, they ruled and one of their victims was Paul himself how many times was he beaten with rods as a penalty for having offended the proprieties and the rules of the synagogue itself and submitted to that judgment not that it was valid in itself but that he recognized the authority from which it came as being valid remember how Paul was stricken when he didn't know he was addressing the high priest and immediately he asked forgiveness so deep was his respect and reverence for Jewish authority that he is commending to the gentile Christians in Rome to submit to it who have been taken into these synagogues as righteous gentiles or fearers of God now that would be a friction because being in the Jewish environment what do they do then about eating what do they do about keeping kosher, what do they do about the whole panoply of Jewish law that regulates diet and life and practice as Christians, as believers in Messiah who has freed them from the law so the gentile believer is in a new kind of friction a new kind of situation to which Paul himself commends them and maybe it has to do even with the preservation of the Christian community because if Judaism was the only valid religious institution acknowledged by Rome if you were outside of it and did not bow to the emperor you were a candidate for death so the preservation of the church was remarkably linked to its relationship with the synagogue and yet in that relationship new kinds of problems were raised that give a special light to chapters 14 and 15 but more than that raised questions for us so maybe I'll let the cat out of the bed right away I believe that there was something salutary for the gentile believers in their synagogue relationship to which they were called by Paul to bow and submit the things that we were talking about before this day to yet unbelieving authority because it is authority has to have a salutary life giving effect on those who can humble themselves to do it when you go in to cover someone or bow to the authority you don't come out the same way you went in what's your text for this I don't have one this is prophetic intuition over which others mocked me last year that something is imputed, something is imparted something is received in humbling just like we receive something if we will take from the depth of Jacob's will and so I believe that the early church received a benefit unknown to us that had everything to do with mediating its geophetic character its gentilic character it brought a dimension to them that had everything to do with the fullness of faith for which Paul says God is waiting for the fullness of the gentiles to be come in so that the deliverer shall come out of Zion God is waiting for something not so much from the Jew as from the church when the fullness of the gentiles be come in so all Israel shall be saved as it is written the deliverer shall come out of Zion take transgression from Jacob according to the covenant that I have made with them as it is written what a statement Paul, where did you get that is given to me as a steward of the mysteries of God that what God is waiting for is not something from the Jew he is waiting for something from the gentile Christian a fullness more than numeric but qualitative something of such proportion that it takes the last vestiges of gentilism away of all that is gentilic and cultural and ethnic and brings into the brings the gentile believer and hebraic fullness by which he is entirely transformed to such an extent that he moves the Jew to jealousy amen but where does he gain that he gains that in the relationship with this people and the submitted relationship with this people where everything that is gentile in his heart would rise up to say who are you to tell me you are not even saved you are yet in darkness the veil is yet over your eyes and you are telling me about this and you are telling them that I can't do this well I am a believer see the church had every natural disposition to be arrogant and as we will read from here this author believes that the key to understanding the book of Romans in these controversial chapters is Paul's jealousy over the issue of the church's arrogance that they not see themselves as Israel's replacement and that they recognize the sanctity of this people they are called and the love of God for their fathers yes they are enemies of the gospel for our sake but for the father's sake they are beloved of God do you know that and if they are beloved of God what should they be for you while they are yet your enemies they are your beloved enemies and I can't tell you dear saints I wish you could be there on Wednesdays to see me with my Rabbi you can see the picture here as I said to him as he drove me to pick up my car with it broken down some miles away and I got a lift by a Muslim Pakistani to the place where I meet with him and we are driving now after the session he is taking me back to my car I said you know dear man that God has sovereignly established our relationship and no man has loved you in all of your orthodox circles and relationships as I he does there is a depth of affection between the two of us that bears all the weight of difference isn't that remarkable we could be at each other's throats no holds barred that was our game rules from the beginning we would not withhold anything and he is insulting me up one side and down the other he has virtually called me every name in the book and haven't you seen the light by now you still continue in your deception haven't I given you sufficient evidence that all of this is colossal claptrap and full of error and that Jesus is very contempt of the Pharisees is ipso facto evidence in itself that he could not be Messiah because the Pharisee of which I am one when he writes his email letters to me he signs it your beloved Pharisee or your Pharisee friend he thinks Pharisee is an honorific term we see it as derogatory because Jesus identified them as hypocrites well that's how much Jesus is way off base that's why he's the phony because a Pharisee cannot be a hypocrite a Pharisee is the epitome of righteousness don't you know it orthodox Judaism is Pharisaical but not in the contemptuous sense in which we use the word for them a Pharisee is a student scholar my rabbi is a 5th generation Talmudic scholar he is as fluent in Aramaic as he is in Hebrew so here is this boob sitting before him who can barely class out a word in Hebrew and I'll show him a scripture that I got him this time because look what it says in Psalm 22 it says he was nailed in his hands pierced in his hands and his feet let me tell you what it really means in Hebrew I'm going to tell him what it means in Hebrew I've got a Goyish edition a Gentile translation that misses the in Hebrew it says something about the other every time I think I've got a mouth he finds a way to to extricate himself because he has the command of the language and it says something else and you know that the remarkable irony is Hebrew will lend itself to that if you only but change the vowel markings of the consonants you change the entire meaning of the words and vowel markings did not come until the Masoretic texts of the third century something like that up till that time Jews read Hebrew only by its consonants well then how do they understand a particular word whose consonants could mean another word you understand what word it is by reading it in its context so they avoid the Christological implications by giving it another meaning in my opinion out of the context but nevertheless stubborn and insistent and if I make any hint that any liberty has been taken with scripture by Hebrew scribes so as to alter and to avoid the Christological implication that's it the lid goes off and the steam comes out and I've touched them in the sore spot because a Pharisee would never do that it's a whole education dear saints it's a whole other life it's an other reality but the thing is it's the commanding reality of this people and though they be few in number their influence billows out and affects the whole of Jewish life and so if you're engaging a Jew in conversation over the Gospel more likely than not it'll end with the statement well if my Rabbi has not believed I don't have to either or I'll ask my Rabbi the Rabbi is the authority and the source there's a remarkable respect for the Rabbis so this is what we're facing and need to know why? because if we have not gone to them or come to them they'll be coming to us in this uprooting of which we're speaking in these days the time of Jacob's trouble and maybe not the least reason is to bring the unbelieving Jew into the proximity with the believing Christian community out of dire necessity and the urgency of flight from persecution would God go so far? I believe so and that he'll have prepared them for our conversation with them by being stripped into wilderness why was I saved in Jerusalem not California where I was a teacher because I had to be uprooted I had to be lifted up and out and removed from my comfortable context not just physically but ideologically and in the process of traveling through the nations the Lord was taking off layer after layer I was stripped and I was bare though when I heard the voice of the Lord for the first time I could hear it because my own mouth and my own platter were shut we are stripping before receiving when they'll come to us they'll come to us stripped not only in their physical nakedness but their ideological and even their religious nakedness because their categories will have been dashed where is God? What again within the same century we're suffering yet another holocaust the state in which we had hoped is now defunct and destroyed and we're being cast out again to all nations as has been the history of old where is God where is our confidence and so we have already a whole number of Jews who have not survived the first holocaust even their greatest spokesman Elie Wiesel is virtually an acknowledged atheist and he was not only orthodox in his origins he was Talmudic he came out of the deepest traditions but the experience of the holocaust are completely annulled that naive religious faith in God so he's a man without faith without God and you're trying to somehow have something to communicate and say to the Jewish community we're going to see men disabused of their naive and inadequate faith and become terribly despondent and depressed even unto death what hope then if there's no God and in that condition we will face them and have to commend to them our Christ our Messiah but it will be such a test for us to bring that communication that will require uttermost sensitivity and in their reactions which may be very angry and heated because they'll believe that what they're suffering this time is what they suffered last time and is the fault of Christianity itself that anti-Semitism has its nexus and a seat out of New Testament scripture itself in the disparaging things that are said about Jews and so they will blame Christianity and your Christians and now in their distress you're trying to take advantage of their being down to force upon them some religion by which they have suffered historically and presently the cards are stacked in every way against us that means that no amount of human well-meaning intention or ability will suffice nothing less than the very wisdom of God the very love of God and there are times with my Rabbi I go absolutely speechless and I tell him I have nothing to say I have no answer I don't know what to say I'm beyond any knowledge or capacity that I have I ache for your question I ache for your indictment that I can't answer it at this moment but because of the provocation I'm called to a deeper apprehension of my own understanding than I would ordinarily seek because most of us are lazy, slothful content with just our little modicum of correct doctrine we're get by Christians the Jew compels us to be the church and I'll tell you that I wrote him a letter in which I said you know from the last session I felt I came away battered battered and bruised not because the man was malicious or he would intend any injury for me but something exuded from his spirit anti-Christ spirit because he's not just a Rabbi he's an anti-missionary Rabbi that's what has intrigued him and I have with me his manuscript not yet published and he'll not publish it until I have finished expressing myself on different points of what he has written and if we will have time I'll read you certain of his statements he's written on atonement, on Messiah on revelation, on scripture, he's he carries the NIV Bible with him, he's no lightweight although he weighs only 135 pounds so something exuded from that man in that particular session I couldn't get away fast enough in fact I cut short and had to take a walk around the screen just to get my sense together I realized I was battered by such powers of darkness that issued from him so there really was a collision of that which he exudes because it's one thing to be a Christ denying Jew by necessity of your Judaism but it's another thing to be a trained professional anti-missionary and when you give yourself to that spirit consistently you're opening the door for the entrance of the powers of darkness and when it has seen the opposite of you and has opportunity it will express such things as making you feel battered have you ever had an occasion where you feel you've been a run over even in the night when you sleep by a hundred Mack trucks you wake up in the morning crumpled and actually feel the physical of friction and I've had occasions like that so we're not in some panty waste contest this is an issue of powers power of God against the powers of darkness and when you come face to face and the man's soul is at stake those powers are going to exert themselves can you imagine what it would mean for this dear Rabbi to finally receive our Christ the loss of his wife seven children his prestigious place in the Jewish community he's a recognized authority it will be shame and scandal of such a kind such expulsion from the community the loss of the dearest things to his heart and life to say yes to Christ and that's what it may mean not only for himself but for many Jews and it has meant already that for Jews who have come to the Lord in times past I almost sometimes say God if we're that cost for every Gentile Christian we would much more deeply esteem the faith that has come because of its cost yeah it's been much too casual much too easy for us to believe and to confess and to repeat after me and that has shown itself in the whole fabric of our present Christianity and its foundational shallowness okay well maybe we'll take a break and just to dwell on all this thank you Lord precious God I'm so happy that I have ought that I can hear that has come from your hand with such grace with the most privileged relationship with the most precious of brothers who's a brother Lord and with such an affection that is beyond sentiment that you yourself have given not only from my side but from his no by every reckoning I should be enemy and yet he knows that he can't say that and he says to me can you say that my father is the devil art as Jesus said to my Pharisaical fathers your father is the devil can you say that to me God I said no I can't bring myself to say that so Lord we're at such a remarkable impasse such a remarkable historical moment we're at such a juncture something called for from the church that has never before ever been brought to our consideration everything till now has been casual inadvertent we've given to Jews for Jesus and missionary organizations and felt that we have discharged our obligation but now something is being called for from us and it's a something that is everything it's ultimate make such requirement my God that we have to exhibit an aura that all along ought to have been and that when we will come to that gracious and full sainthood you'll be their deliverer out of that sire so we thank you Lord precious God on high employ everything my God bring to memory little words spoken and exchanged the episodes and experiences in New York whatever it is in the seminary and the synagogues and the Jewish community centers and the steam room everything Lord to encourage these saints to believe that if we'll only give ourselves and put ourselves in the place of accessibility to that people you yourself will set in motion what you will we have withheld ourselves we have not wanted to travel through their Samaria or to be found at their will let alone to drink from it and we ask your forgiveness for our pride break it Lord this is the thing that that Paul feared more than anything as the apostle to the church is its arrogance and only our relationship with his people can temper us and bring the appropriate humility that bears your image and makes the church the church so do we bless you Lord for such thoughts such considerations as you're putting before us continue to do so my God we don't know how we thank and give you praise in Yeshua's holy name Amen
