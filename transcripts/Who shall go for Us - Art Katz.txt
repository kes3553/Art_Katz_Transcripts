Who shall go for Us - Art Katz

So, Lord, you know that I don't like to repeat myself. I don't even like to drive back the same way that I came.

But here's the final service, Lord, and if you'll give them even a measure of what you doled out in the first service, they'll have plenty, my God, to chew upon. So come and use the glorious text that you're opening in new dimensions of consideration, that it should pierce our hearts and haunt us. And we will continue to dote upon and dwell upon the remarkable applications of what is condensed in one text in Isaiah chapter 6 of a man who saw the Lord high and lifted up and set in motion a train of events by which even the present condition of the nation, Israel, is yet in bonds. So come, Lord, and give us a second wind to take it up again, and we thank and give you praise in Jesus' name.

Amen.

Virtually all of my devotional readings today somehow convinced me of the things to share in today's Spurgeon Faiths Checkbook, Purity of Heart and Life. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. There's a close connection between the affections and the understanding. If we love evil, we cannot understand that which is good.

If the heart is foul, the eye will be dim.

How can those men see a holy God who love unholy things? Because I was saying to this morning's congregation, your spiritual condition has everything to do with your ability to hear a true word, let alone your ability to respond. And few of us are cognizant of that, that something is required of us in order to have an affinity for the things that are holy. But if we have been careless about our life, our heart, about our discipline, then we'll be dull.

We're incapable of hearing and considering. The eye will be dim.

How can we see holy things that require purity of heart and life? Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God and see the things about God. So what a privilege it is to see God here, a glimpse of him in heaven below. When Isaiah had that privilege, as we will examine in just a few moments, it destroyed him. To see God as he is is not the little icing on the cake, it's a devastation, but it's the foundation for all true seeing. Because it not only reveals God as he is, it reveals us as we are, and that we have not adequately understood nor sought nor considered. Until you have cried out, woe is me, I'm undone, you do not know the truth of your own condition. You do not know what sin is. Sin waits for the revelation of the truth of ourselves seen in the connection with God as he in fact is, high and lifted up. Doesn't mean in some kind of exalted brocaded garment filling the temple.

It means on the cross. It means his majesty in suffering. It means his character revealed in sacrifice.

Nothing reveals God more profoundly than what he suffered on the cross. The most acute statement of God as God is to be found in that place and that place alone.

If you yawn this morning, please cover your mouth. Okay.

So that's what Isaiah saw. And though he was a great prince of the prophets, he cried out, oy vey.

That's the Jewish expression. The same as in German, vey means pain. W-E-H pronounced as vey. Oy means ultimate.

Oh, the unspeakable pain, the excruciating pain. For I have seen the Lord as he in fact is and not as I have thought him to be. I have seen him in his truest majesty as it was revealed in the ultimate extremity of his suffering.

You say, Art, how can that be?

Because Isaiah is seven centuries prior to the advent of the cross. But you silly saps need to be reminded that Jesus was crucified before the foundation of the earth was laid. That event is so cosmic, so beyond time, that it doesn't wait for its actual historic advent.

You understand?

It was conceived in the mind of God, and its enactment and point of time is only a necessity. But the reality itself was available for the gaze of men to whom God would give privilege as he gave to Isaiah seven centuries before the advent itself.

If you can't understand that, you're disqualified. You'll never be sent. Because what have you to communicate?

You have only conventional notions of time and space, and God usually of a sentimentally discolored kind, which will not add anything to anyone if God should send you. To be sent is ultimate, what's the word, ultimate call, ultimate privilege, ultimate statement. And that's why it says in Isaiah six, who shall go for us? There's almost a note of cry between the persons of the Godhead conferring, who shall go for us, as if the who suggests. There are not many, not many candidates. There are many who want to go, who have itch and impulse and ambition, but what will they communicate? They cannot communicate more than what they themselves are in God. And if they don't even have a proper knowledge of God, but a God of their own imagination, even label Jesus, who helps them in the way that they want to go, then what will they communicate?

They'll not be called.

It was not that it was that Isaiah was in the neighborhood when the father and the son were communing over who shall go for us, and he happened to overhear it. It's that having passed through the travail of the great anguish of soul, of seeing the truth of himself in view of the light of the sacrifice of God, that he cried out, I'm undone, that made him a candidate.

Can you understand?

If he was only a little patsy prophet, he would not even so much as have heard the call, let alone been in a place to say send me. It took a devastation of his soul to fit him to be a candidate for going, because God's ventures in the earth are not religious. It's not because he's spinning his thumbs and he has nothing better to do than he's looking for some activity. He's not even riveted by the great needs that are in the world. Those needs are immemorial, timeless. His sendings have to do with his own strategic heart, the genius of his own wisdom and his own will. They have to be on time and sent directly to the point of God's intention, and that what we lack is an appropriate respect for the word sending, which is at the heart of the word apostolic.

Apostolos means sent one.

And who of us have contemplated that?

We went, but we're not sent. Well, how do you know art?

Because in the first apostolic sendings, it says of them, these are they that turned the world upside down. When you are sent by God and not by a committee, you have the authority of God with you and the words that are appointed from the throne of heaven, and that constitutes event when they are spoken in the place to which they are sent, and that turns the world upside down. But not only do you lack the sense of the significance of sending, and that's why the makeshift, shabby, casual knit and composition of our churchianity, but you're not even aware that the world needs to be turned upside down. In fact, you're quite comfortable with it as it in fact is, or maybe it needs a little improvement, a little amelioration, but nothing so radical as to controvert what the world is and what it stands for and to be turned inside out and upside out as if it represents patent evil and malicious lies and altogether is out of the bosom of the wicked one who's the father of lies and in whom the whole world abides.

You don't see the world that way, do you? I know you don't. So how can you be sent?

Because you don't see as God sees. Because you're not chafed by the omnipresent evil that is all the more vile because it purports to be good, and it is so full of charm and unctuous little niceties and amenities of language and style that the whole world swallows with line hook and sinker. I'm the only one who's outraged when I turned the dial watching the World Series game. There was a break and just to see what else is on in my rare occasions before a TV set, I couldn't believe what I was watching. One episode where the teenage girl takes in her surreptitious lover into her bedroom and they're making out like a house of fire. The only thing that prevented the full consummation was that mother came home and right away the young man scoots into the closet and the girl pats her hair and converses with mother like nothing has happened.

Amazing. What's the word for it?

A droid, able, non-plussed, not at all disturbed, able to field the moment and conceal as if it's a long practiced art by a teenage girl. Of course, the mother suspects but is not able to identify and if she did, she could not acquire the ability to do so. But the young man is not able to identify and if she did, she could not accuse because she herself is a divorcee. So there's no moral foundation in that home of which the girl's conduct is but a reflection. That was one of the little episodes as I'm twisting the dial. The other one was a modeling program and young girls tittering with excitement, most of them minority girls wanting to get into the limelight and dressed up like whores and the homosexual director is showing them how to pose alongside the automobile and one of his assistants, God knows what his sexual aberration is, sticks his hand under the posterior of this girl and lifts it up on the fender to show it to greater advantage. I'm puking all over the place and these girls are tittering with excitement. That this may be the key to recognition and success because they have a bosom or a or a buttock. And then at the end was, I made the mistake of turning back again, a final panel and on the panel was the director, the homosexual and some other character and then there was a black man who was wearing feminine apparel but his voice was gruff and masculine and I realized I'm looking at a transvestite and he's on the panel as an authority on fashion and not a soul takes any special note of the fact that he is an aberration and a strange piece of perverse humanity record just received with that wonderful liberality of a society that makes way for everyone.

How come you don't hate that world? How is it you're not chafed by it? That's why you're not called.

So the great chapter of Isaiah 6 begins in the year that King Uzziah died. What is God doing giving us a little chronological setting so that we know it's around that period of time or is there something of significance that has to do with this leprous king's passing and the revelation that comes to the prophet? You can't be prophetic and not imagine that this death is more than just a chronological event that marks a period of time but that there's something to do with the prophet something had to die in the in Uzziah's passing that permitted the greater revelation of God. I'm just talking off the top of my head but maybe there was something symbiotic in the relationship the admiration of the prophet for one of Israel's better kings in fact he was so good and so impressive that he presumed to do the work of priests and became leprous on the spot and died a leper but maybe there was an admiration for the man by the prophet as kind of exaltation for an earthly king that kept him from the proper viewing of the heavenly king which ought to raise the question for us what Uzziah is there for us whose death we would lament and wish to deny because there's something serving our purpose of identification with that someone it need not be a man it could be a ministry could be an admired pastor it could be a marriage it could be a marriage it could be your own ambition something that is being adulated and held in a place of esteem that blocks the more complete revelation of God as God I don't think that that would be doing injustice to the text that the death of Uzziah is more than circumstantial it was the key to the revelation of the Lord high and lifted up because the Lord as king was being kept in an inferior place so long as that earthly thing was commanding the affection the attention and the admiration of the prophet you need to ask what earthly thing what is your Uzziah that keeps you from the fuller revelation of God whose passing you would regret but this passing when it comes is not just to be tacitly acknowledged like okay if you say so Lord but you've got to join the chorus of angels and say about the death of this painful loss holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory you've got to celebrate the death celebrate the loss not as mere happenstance that you have to suffer and hold your breath and hold your breath but that you agree with God in the removal of this obstruction to your fuller seeing of himself and you rejoice for it even though it's the death of something or someone that has been very dear to you for a long time but you agree with the sovereignty of God in its removal either it dies or he dies and is taken away or you die to it one way or the other there's got to be a death and you've got to rejoice in that death of saying holy holy holy because if you don't see as the angelic seraphim see what in fact are you going to communicate if you're sent what the world needs is angelic divine seeing the perspective of God and that one especially that not just condescends to approve the divine sovereignty but rejoices for it even when it's painful i know i'm way over your head well you'll hear the tape a few times but what if for example if your usiah is Israel itself the state of Israel for which you have long waited for its success and don't the jews have it coming and have it they deserved and how long without a motherland and blah blah blah blah and though they're going through a present time of trouble it'll straighten out and Israel will be what we had long waited and hoped for what if the nation of Israel should perish together with sharon what if every hope that you have had for it goes up like a puff what if you realize that all you were doing was sentimentalizing and projecting humanistically upon the hope of the success of a state whose intent in God is more than success but his glory and that his glory is never achieved except through a resurrection preceded by death that your desire for their success rather than his glory was a statement of how diminished and limited you were in your own christianity in your own view and that what you desired for Israel you desire for yourself that success had a higher premium than glory therefore you you had you lost you had not even the foundational prophetic rule of reckoning and of seeing and that's why God has to take it from you that Israel has to die which i believe is inevitable and must come and is already in progress not just the state but that Israel that has proliferated through the nations that smug humanism that self-assurance that we jews have has got to be brought down or did you think that we could be a priestly nation with it hey i mean just how bad is your condition is what i'm asking how little do you understand what priestlyness is if you think jews in their present constituency can be a nation of priests and the light unto the world you don't know from beans if you don't recognize that that kind of priestlyness before and behalf of God behalf of men before God and before God with men requires a whole new nature that has to pass through death and resurrection in order to bless all the families of the earth how come you didn't know that how come you you entertained facile and shallow notions of Israel's success that you zaya has got to die and you should have heard me when i preached this in dallas texas to christian zionists preceded by such artful worship of a hebraic kind that was almost sacrilegious for God like me to get up and speak after that they were having a blast they were already dancing the horror and all of the celebrated hebraic zionistic kinds of enjoyment as if Israel had already passed through death to life and then i came with that message that this you zaya has to die and they're already embarked upon sending jews to Israel and thinking that they're doing God's service not knowing that they're sending them from the frying pan into the fire but so anxious to do and be at the cutting edge of God's work by facilitating the movement of jews to Israel at a time when it is least appropriate following me that's when you act when you're not sent that's when you initiate that's when you've out of your well-meaning intention you perform and and conduct things that clot up the works and actually impede and obstruct the true work of God because it is a satisfaction for you you want to be saved from the predictability of christian services and the monotony of our present christendom and how what more exciting thing than to help jews to get to Israel is that what God wants ultimately but not presently and the year the king you zaya died i saw also the lord high and lifted up now listen you guys tune into this this will take incredible divine facility what isaiah saw and the lord high and lifted up is the unspeakable terror of sin he saw the nature the nature of evil he saw what was inherently in all men and all men that he would cry out woe is me i am undone i'm a man of unclean lips and he could have just left off the last part all he had to say was i'm a man i've seen the lord and now i see and the magnitude of that sacrifice for sin what must be the essential character of man everywhere including prophetic man and i'm undone i now understand the exceedingly sinful sinfulness of sin if there's one out of a hundred in this room that has this knowledge now i would be astonished we are all defective in the knowledge of the exceeding sinfulness of sin oh we may occasionally mouth the word but our lack of deep contrition or repentance of the kind which i preached last night and which tape you need to get is not in our experience we are very much satisfied with ourselves as we are and do not see ourselves as somehow inheriting some adamic curse in our essential humanity of a depraved kind that cannot be rectified or improved we don't see ourselves as undone therefore we're not candidates to be sent because we do not have an adequate sense of sin and of evil we have bought the world's ameliorative and humanistic notions of well we're not all that bad and we're nice guys basically we do not agree with God and that isaiah's cry was approved of God he did not discourage the prophet and say don't get carried away you're the prince of prophets look what you've already spoken for five chapters but he sent an angel bearing a coal from off the altar to purge the unclean lips God is in perfect agreement that that cry woe is me i'm undone is totally valid and not only is it valid he's waiting for it before he releases that purging because there'll be no purging until until there's a depth of acknowledgement of what needs to be purged that is eradicable deep intrinsic intuitive built in to what we are as men that we need to agree with God about the total depravity of man that where sin is being saved by the grace of God and not nice guys who have only boo-booed you see what you need to do like me is subscribe to the new york times every day and have a pair of scissors at hand and clip out the articles from every section whether it's the sports section or fashion it's in the fashion section that i learned that what's his name trump donald trump leads the male fashion world there's a donald trump addition a whole wardrobe of suits and ties and shirts and suspenders and socks and underwear with his name well hilfiger did pretty good every time i see that name on a belt or a shirt or just the insignia on a christian i want to rip it off how dare we exhibit on our bodies any other name and be walking advertisements for commerce that plays upon the celebrity of name and prestige of men you see what you're succumbing to what you're part of as a system and you're not even conscious of it as an evil how then can you be sent in the shortest time donald trump has eclipsed every long-standing fashion house what do i know about it why because his name is synonymous with success with prestige with power with influence and there are men that are weak and want to wear it if they can only put it on that's the world you guys that's what drives it when you get to the financial section and read what the ceos are into next unbelievable corruption and scandal that they're not ashamed whatsoever of bilking their own corporations knowing that they're about to go bankrupt but before they do they're going to stuff their pockets with 75 million dollars worth of separation retirement and other kinds of amenities that the guy who had been the head of the stock market got 194 million dollars in payout separation fees when he decided to leave there's not a man on earth that's worth 194 million dollars let alone some punk who calls together the sessions of wall street but what about our athletes and what they are receiving for catching and throwing don't you understand it's grotesque in a world that's dying for poverty and want that we have this distortion of value am i the only one that goes back to the depression years and remembers how we held a five cent bottle of pepsi cola like it was going on a business and had to share it with my brother and my mother because for one person to drink the whole bottle himself would have been considered excessive there's no sense of value once you allow men like that with their millions and billions well the last thing i want that i prayed lord don't let me sound like some old kaja rattling out from his cultural bias that he doesn't like long hair because in his generation it was not known and so when he objects to it now he's speaking out of a personal antipathy you know that we have to humor not at all no long hair is vile script itself tells us that nature itself considers it to be an abomination for men to have long hair and anything that disguises the gender distinctions that God established in creation is already a step in the enemy's camp earrings and all that they can note but what is yet worse are those who sport those things as christians with the assumption that their spirituality is of such a kind that for others it might indicate some area of moral compromise but they are so superior to that that that's not true with them that presumption is worse than those who don't see it so don't think i'm just rattling off what's the word misanthropic you know a sour view of mankind by an older generation who's taking umbrage against these present phenomena but i know this to the degree that we have allowed the present phenomena into the church and made it comfortable and not an issue because who are we to point out after all it's just an external thing it's the inward thing that really counts that spiritual what a bunch of baloney the external thing is the statement of the internal thing and it is not without significance and you allow it into your house to permeate the lump and to bring the whole association that goes with that demeanor but we don't want to offend anybody and we're a church for all nations well we're what are we we're a potluck assemblage of every kind of thing that ought more to be scrutinized and ought not to be as comfortable in an environment that is holy and separated unto God and despises the world and loves righteousness and hates iniquity that's that's a description of a son so after i finished last night pouring my soul out you've got to get the tape i go out into the hallway first with some brittle women like you wondered were they at that meeting with their questions that had no relationship to what i had poured my soul out and then this guy with long hair standing there telling me how much he enjoyed the message oh i said then are you going to the barbershop tomorrow if you enjoyed the message and approved it does that mean that you will now act on its basis for righteousness sake and if there's any question of whether or not the removal of this hairstyle down to your shoulders is righteous err on the side of believing for it you'll not offend God and when the when the scissors come you'll tremble because there's a valence and a power in that style that you have not been able to recognize until it's that threat of being removed don't tell me that these fashions are just little overt superficial things and that's that's not a man's real spirituality oh yeah try removing it try touching it try raising even a question about it but the love of righteousness does not wait to be proved righteousness itself would compel us for God's sake not to err on anything that resembles that which is in the world that is approved of men and has become its style you want to shun and and move in the opposite direction instead we're only too eagerly embracing it condoning it and making it even normative for the church how then shall we be called where's the holy ghost who would say separate unto me Paul and bonibus for the work where unto i have called them he's waiting for an anti-arch that has not yet come because the true church is a place of separation not a place of condoning those things that are offensive to God because we're afraid to offend men and meanwhile the world is dying waiting for that one thing alone that has any prospect for its salvation a sent man with a sent word from the throne of heaven of the kind that i brought in africa only some months ago as i told the earlier session that when i arrived and came into that speaking hall and looked at these hundreds of black faces and felt like the white cork bobbing in the black sea the anomaly you feel so strange you're so american so white so culturally identifiable and you know that you're not that but they don't know it and what they want from you is american they want a glib formula for church success and advance of numbers and and all the other kinds of things that we americans have so happily and cleverly devised that we could help them buttress their careers and have greater numbers so after we rearranged the room for the better acoustics my first statement was and i can't even now mimic it it sounded like a blast like an infernal door had burst open to men who were half asleep under the mid-date heat and listening to other of the speakers droning on when i said i am a sent man from the throne of heaven with a sent word from God boom it wasn't the soul that yawned or slumbered after that they jerked and came alive in their seats their jaws dropped their eyes bulged they never heard a man with the awful voice of the never heard a man with the effrontery and the arrogance to make such an announcement and whose subsequent speaking that went on for hours in every way confirmed it that's what it means to be sent who shall go for us is God's continuing plaintiff cry and anyone who has seen the lord and his sin and the condition of what iniquity sin and evil is has something that needs to be conveyed to the world if we do not know sin in this extremity we do not know God we do not have a place of reality this is the foundation of reality is the knowledge of sin the issue of iniquity and of evil its prevalence its sweeping dominance its intrinsic aspect in the very nature of men and that we see even in those forms of it of human culture that purport to put man at his best foot forward the vilest expression of it all the more because it purports to be good but is so patently evil only a man who has seen that is qualified to be sent because in seeing that he has seen God in fact if he had not seen God he had not seen that it is in seeing God not seen that it is in seeing God and the sacrifice for the expiation of sin that the revelation of what sin is as sin is alone conveyed oh did you get that only the recognition of what is required by the wisdom and love of God to expiate sin namely the death of his son excruciatingly is itself the revelation of the iniquity of sin to miss the cross is to miss the issue to sentimentalize the cross is to disguise the issue to trivialize the cross is to trivialize God how then shall you be sent what's your message it's not what you speak and being sent only is what you are in yourself through and through so when when isaiah said send me the lord said go he didn't tell him go to what or where or what you're going to perform because isaiah didn't ask him if you ask you're already disqualified if you need to know in advance what it will mean and where you're going and what the assurances will be and the prospect of succeeding you're already disqualified the one who goes has no criterion for himself no factum of any kind that pertains to his future his life his success his death he hears the cry of God who and this is here am i and God says go but when you read the text what do you get go and speak to this people Israel and say to them in your speaking their ears are going to go deaf their eyes will go blind their hearts will become numb their minds cannot understand to be saved or to be healed your word to them before when you spoke you only charge them with warning now when you speak as one being sent you condemn them to a condition of judgment into which they presently suffer to this very historic moment all Israel is under that judgment except for the peripheral jew who squeaks in like me but the nation itself per se is under the judgment that came with the sending of a prophet speak for your speaking is not going to encourage it's not going to give them future hope it's going to condemn them and fix them in utterness of judgment so much so that the prophet says lord how long because if he's profiting he knows God he knows that judgment is not God's final word it's his ultimate word the final word is mercy but it's only mercy because it issues out from judgment and nullifies judgment and that's where you come in here's what i'm thinking saints for the first time i can't say thus saith the lord although i do have a bit of authority and the things pertaining to the kingdom but i suspect in the divine logic of God that the same requirement that brought the judgment that is of a prophet sent will be the same means by which the judgment will be lifted that we're coming to the age of the end where the until is now about to be fulfilled where cities will be laid waste and without inhabitant and many will be rooted up and expelled into other places and wholesale devastations to come into the land but at that time i believe that God will complete the circuit and nullify the judgment that came from a prophetic sending by another prophetic sending that when you speak prophetically and in the authority of God as one sent their eyes will be opened their ears will be unstoppable their hearts will be yielded they'll believe and be saved by a word of a prophetic kind that issues only by those who can go because they're commanded and are sent if that's true then the whole destiny of Israel for the last days waits upon a church that will come to the same prophetic efficacy and reality that isaiah himself knew and how will you come to it will you come to it in a way different than other but then but by which he obtained it or will you come to it by exactly the same means your usiah has got to die is it this church your movement this pastor this ministry your ambition there's a death for which God waits for your not uh reluctant agreement but your your seraphic and angelic rejoicing holy holy holy is the lord of hosts for the whole earth is full of his glory lord where do we see that now the whole earth is full of mischief and mayhem and sin but the angelic view is so all-encompassing seeing all time including the future that's the kind of seeing that needs to come into those who are desolate and desperate angelic vision God's own perspective because it rests upon being able to say holy to a condition of death that our humanity would would avoid somehow this is not something that will come in course of time and you just sit and wait for it i believe it requires an active renunciation of something to do with flesh something to do with that which has filled in for God maybe even in the name of God that which you're so occupied in his behalf has taken such a vested interest and role that until that thing perishes or you die to it you can never come into the full revelation of the lord himself as he in fact is and you'll still fall short of the cry woe is me and you'll fall short of this of the call who shall go for us send me so i want to pray for such a church that rejoices with the seraphim at the total sovereignty of God even if he brings down the house brings down the ministry brings down the movement brings down the denomination brings down our hopes for the future our own ambition whatever it is that stands in the way of that fuller revelation of himself which few of us have had because we do not yet adequately hate iniquity and love righteousness we have sentimentalized we have shallowly honored we have even trivialized the cross and the one who bore it and the rest suffers and God is waiting for those who have come into such a place of seeing and perfect agreement with himself that of necessity requires death i can't say it any other way so lord may we not buck may we not be chafed and squirm and try to extricate and find another way to justify you zaya he's been around so long we've enjoyed what he represents and even emulate and imitate and want to be like him forgetting that he died as a presumptuous leper and something left of a leprotic is that the word form of leprosy has infiltrated the church there's something corrupt and defiling in the church because we're admiring the presumption of a man who became a leper by assuming for himself a function that God never intended and how many false apostles are there false prophets now guilty of exactly that presumption whose leprosy is yet to visibly break out but the corruption of it is already being circulated through those who admire them and want to be part of that team and be franchised to represent it in this place and in that because of ambition so lord i don't even know how to pray there's a cry there's a need for sent ones who can speak the word that this time does not condemn and judge but liberates and opens because they go in the authority of the sender having waited exclusively for his commission and having fulfilled the conditions alone by which they could even hear the cry who shall go for us my God if this is a word for the church let it not fall on deaf ears given understanding those children that are taken up with the world its fashions its styles that that has to die for them to have a greater sense of the of God that has eluded them and condemns them to shallowness come my God have the prophetic authentic thing in this earth that you can send and know that it will perform the thing intended for there's a world dying for the want of it and in Israel dying for the want of it whose judgment can only be upturned by another word that comes to it in the same prophetic authority and efficacy as the judgment came at the first by that one or even that corporate prophetic people who are sent that there be a determination in this congregation today whatever it takes to be found in that company whatever death whatever separation from whatever dear thing is required we're willing to make it transact with this people lord and bring forth such a pure and prophetic speaking in the earth that would be life-giving and life-saving to your people Israel in yoshua's name we pray God's people said amen
