Definition of an Apostolic Church - Art Katz

Holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, while you're yet in the earth, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession. Consider what is apostolic and what is priestly, and bring that into your deepest consideration, for the church that is not apostolic and not priestly forfeits any part in God's end-time purpose. So the great word that we need to understand, to apprehend and to apprehend it by, is the word apostolic or apostle. And these two great words, apostle and prophet, are under the severest attack now, not directly, but subtly, by men who presume to use these titles, whom God has never sent, who have no priestly distinction nor understanding, and are not ashamed to call themselves and be called by these great titles.

So we need to be jealous for the great words.

If we lose these words and their meaning, we lose the whole genius of the church.

So may the word find lodging in your heart.

Apostle, prophet. We have a black lady living behind my house in Minnesota, because 14 years ago I spoke in Mobile, Alabama, and when I spoke the word apostle or apostolic, she said the word went directly into my heart. I didn't know what it meant, but I knew one day I would be with this man over that subject, and she is with this man, my age, 75, 76, living in the arctic region of North America, Minnesota, going on for her ninth year, because she heard one word.

But what a word.

Lord, great high priest and apostle of our confession, can anyone be more jealous over this word than you?

You are the very personification of it.

And the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

You subsume in yourself these two great titles. So impart to us an understanding. And send the word into our heart as you did into that black lady. And we will be so jealous for its meaning.

So watchful over these words, that we will be able to discern those who say they are apostles and are not, and equally recognize the sent ones who come to us, who indeed are sent.

So we thank you.

Grant us grace, Lord, and this concluding word, that of all of the subjects that could yet be touched, you have appointed this as the final omega word of these days.

So speak again. Your servants are hearing.

We thank and give you praise in Jesus' name.

Now you'll be surprised to learn where we're going to begin.

The book of Exodus, chapter 25.

You say, how could that possibly have anything to do with the New Testament word of Russell? And the answer is everything.

In chapter 25 of Exodus, God gives Moses, who himself is an essential apostle, because God said to him out of the burning bush, I have heard the cries of my people, I have seen their oppression, their cry has come up to me from the earth, therefore I send you to confront Pharaoh, to bring my people out from Egypt, and into the land of milk and honey. So in Moses we have the essential elements of the cold man, that begins with a confrontation of God, in a form in which he does not show himself to many, God in the burning bush, God in the fire of judgment, and he waited to see what Moses would do, would he pass by and avoid looking, sensing that this is something unusual, and that it would be safe for me not to consider it.

Any man who considers what is safe for him is disqualified immediately, but he turned aside to see.

When God saw that he turned aside, and when God saw that he turned aside, he called Moses, Moses, take off your shoes, for the ground upon which you stand is holy. An apostle is one who will not turn away, but look into the fire, for whatever frightening thing that implies, not out of just mere curiosity, but he wanted to know why the tree burned, but was not extinguished. He wants to get to the root of the matter, and understand the ultimate nature of this mystery, whatever the cost to himself, because the rabbis say, on one of the rare occasions when they are right, that if a man turns aside to see something as potentially terrifying as that, he can never turn back again. That one turning, that one seeing, changes everything, affects all seeing and all consideration, and you're ruined for God.

Do you have such a heart in you?

Because the apostles are the foundation of the Church.

What then is the superstructure that is raised up upon it? Exactly the same character as the foundation itself.

So I pray that you're disposed to turn so as to see, to examine so as to understand, and if you hear your name called twice, you know that this is going to be a dangerous calling. But you say, here am I, on the holy ground, my shoes are off, send me. It was to this Moses, who is the father of our faith, the prototype of the great apostolic figure, one who was sent, who feels disqualified, who am I that I should speak for you?

I'm not a man of easy speech. Moses's disqualification qualified him. Because if you think you're able, and you can perform this on the basis of your competence, you're disqualified. That's a contradiction.

An apostle is extremely conscious of his infirmity.

Who am I that you should send me? And God did not argue with him. But I will be with you.

That's what distinguishes an apostle and an apostolic church. God will be with you because he has called you, because he sends you, because beyond your own ability, he will be with you. My priest and the apostle of our confession.

Well, you'll have to read my book, Apostolic Foundations, which has been translated into Spanish, but not yet published. And we're leaving tomorrow for Panama to meet the brother who has done the translation. A convict who was saved in jail had been a drug peddler. And after his conversion, he found my book in English on the website and was enormously moved by it and has translated the entire book into Spanish. What a classic volume. There's an entire chapter devoted to the word eternity.

Apostolic character, apostolic proclamation, the principalities and powers of the air, priestliness.

Who knows anything about that?

But Jesus is the high priest and the apostle, which indicates that if you're not a priest, neither can you be an apostle. The priestliness precedes the calling. Whatever this priestliness means, it needs to be discovered afresh and be incorporated into the walk if we're to be an apostolic body. In Exodus chapter 25, God gives Moses the pattern on the mount, how to build the tabernacle that will house God's presence and accompany Israel through its wilderness wandering and come finally into the land the center of Zion.

So this is more than just little quaint details.

The details and specifications of God are full of meaning. So you shall make an ark in verse 10 because the ark will contain the tablets of the law and the word of Aaron and the pot of manna and the everlasting significance of the history of Israel. So it's made out of humble wood of the kind that grows in the wilderness that is warped and twisted or somehow has to be worked into a chest and be overlaid with gold and here the length is given and the depth and the height In verse 11 you overlay it with pure gold inside and outside because gold is the symbol of deity of God. Wood is the symbol of humanity ordinary wood but clothed with gold on the inside and the outside. What a picture of a true saint whose humanity is overlaid with God not only on the outside but also on the inside. Because we also are arks we also carry a treasure We have this treasure in our earthly vessels not the tablets of the law the Lord give it himself but the arks of God bearing a heavenly treasure which we need to live and give expression and worship him. God does not despise our humanity no matter how humble but he provides himself the gold of God both outside and inside to uncover it. And then verse 17 after telling us in 16 you shall put into the ark a testimony that which I shall give you and you shall make a mercy seat that's God's own terminology there's nothing here that issues from man this is the pattern of God from heaven the heavenly pattern and make it of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length and a half the breadth you shall make two cherubim of gold of beaten work you shall make them in the two ends of the mercy seat one cherub on the one side one on the other side and they shall make them of the two ends and these angelic things shall stretch forth their wings and touch each other with their wings and their faces shall look one to another toward the mercy seat shall the faces of cherubims be and you shall put this mercy seat above the ark and in the ark you shall put the testimony that which I shall give you ten commandments and there I will meet with you and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat and between the two cherubims which upon the ark of the testimony of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel I wish we had all night just to consider this because this is God's appointed place not just then but now where He will meet with us in the place of mercy where the two cherubim face each other formed out of the same gold formed out of the same gold with their wings touching looking at each other in the face and at the same time down and through they are to the testimony of the Lord of the righteous requirement of God God says there I will meet with you that's where my presence will be and there only I will meet with you in the place of tension and conflict between opposites male and female gringo and mexican jew and gentile prophet and teacher wherever there are opposites by their very nature by their very calling that will always give place for tension and conflict in the place of that tension if you'll not turn away from each other but look each other in the face as a jew and as a palestinian that's where I'll meet with you and there I will commune with you and give you instruction and understanding I will be present there above the mercy seat between the wings of the cherubim that's the place we want to run from because we don't like tension we don't like conflict we would rather look the other way than look into the face of that one who seems to oppose us and not oppose us in trifles but oppose us by their very nature of being opposite one to the other they are opposite one to the other God knew that God made that the symbolic angels on opposite ends representing opposite things but compelled to look each other in the face and not turn away and whatever the issues between you whatever the background and violence and misunderstanding injustice and oppression look down through the mercy seat where the blood of the lamb will be sprinkled and see the tablets of the Lord below I'm not asking you to take shortcuts or forget the issues let bygones be bygones smooth it over in the Latin way no the issues must be faced or they must be faced in righteousness but they must be seen through the place of mercy and that's where I'll meet with you and that's where I'll meet with you when you come to that place in priestly attitude I will not shrink from it there and only there I will meet with you commune with you from above the mercy seat between the cherubim and we'll give you all things the commandments to the children of Israel somewhere last night or early this morning I was too tired to get up and turn the light on I was too tired to get up and turn the light on I should have written it down I should have written it down the phrase came to me that this place where God will meet and commune with us is the nexus of apostolic authority and power is the nexus of apostolic authority and power I know what I've just said is completely over your head I know what I've just said is completely over your head but don't panic you'll have the tape and you'll need to hear all of this several times the nexus the heart the crossroads where a reality of a certain kind is to be found where a reality of a certain kind is to be found uniquely needed in a troubled world on earth and in the church especially apostolic authority the apostolic power the signs of the apostle is where God is who himself is the high priest and the apostle of our profession and will impart to us himself if we meet him in the place of opposition in the place of tension in the place of conflict black and white Indian Mexican Indian and Spanish descendant white aristocracy where one has been the victim of the other where one has been the victim of the other over long centuries of exploitation that don't even want to look at each other that don't even want to look at each other as we experienced yesterday the day before we made a trip to Salitas Salito and Saltillo just to see this ancient city and its plaza just to see this ancient city and its plaza under whose surface Jews who were burned at the stake are believed to be buried you need to know your own history Jews have been tortured and burned alive in your Mexico for being Jews by what is called Christianity by what is called Christianity little wonder that they are so resistant they remember the historic past of which you yourself are ignorant of which you yourself are ignorant and we walked around the plaza and two or three times we passed peons the simple people of the earth the simple people of the earth dark, complected obviously poor clearly uneducated and they could not even lift up their eyes to look at me and they could not even lift up their eyes to look at me but enough to see the familiar complexion but enough to see the familiar complexion and all that it symbolizes and to look away with a hard look that has ages old in history I don't think Mexico will ever be a glory to God I don't think Mexico will ever be a glory to God until there is a reconciliation of all its peoples until there is a reconciliation of all its peoples in the one place that God has established in the one place that God has established where the opposites need to meet and not look away but look each other in the face which some of your children are unable to do to us here which some of your children are unable to do to us here they come to shake our hands but they don't look at us where did they learn that? it's something instinctive but it's not kingdom but it's not kingdom they should look us full in the face why are they shaking our hands?

for formality?

to look into each other's faces is to see the face of God to look into each other's faces is to see the face of God this is not just an answer for the church this is not just an answer for the church it's an answer for the world for the Jews, the Israelis and the Palestinians for the Jews, the Israelis and the Palestinians violence and bloodshed and violence and torture how will that ever be reconciled?

how will group peace ever be reconciled?

only in the place where God is only in the place where God is if we look at each other face to face and see at the same time the mercy of God and the righteousness of God and the righteousness of God because there he will meet with us there he will give us instruction there he will give us an answer in what seems to us an irreconcilable problem in the ages old brother in the ages old brother you don't get over this overnight and these prejudices are deep and they exist even in the church that glosses over and doesn't want to look at it where there are classes and some are not willing to look at others and that itself reflects the culture of Mexico and that itself reflects the culture of Mexico and is more disposed to recognize and to esteem what is white than what is dark where they are willing to see so I want to take you from this so I want to take you from this to the book of Acts to the first apostolic sending to the first apostolic sending chapter 13 the church at Antioch the church at Antioch this is the beginning not Jerusalem Antioch because the church at Jerusalem was totally Jewish because the church at Jerusalem was totally Jewish but the church at Antioch was diverse in its racial and cultural nature it's interesting it required this kind of a nexus for an apostolic sending it required this kind of a nexus to require diversity and opposites because we read in chapter 13 there were in the church at Antioch not at the church, in the church not at the church, in the church certain prophets and teachers and you know the difference between a prophet and a teacher? there's nothing more offensive to a teacher than a prophet because the teacher is systematic because the teacher is systematic he divides the word of God carefully, and only the word but a prophet he's going through the wall he talks from the label on a ketchup bottle he talks from the label on a ketchup bottle he has visions he's too impatient to be restricted merely to the narrow word to be restricted merely to the narrow word that's the nature of his calling to be a sweeping visionary but the teacher is exactly the opposite but the teacher is exactly the opposite he is suspicious about these visionaries he is suspicious about these visionaries where did you get that?

where does the bible say that? where do you take the liberty to interpret that?

I'm speaking out of experience I've had to live with this for many years I've had to live with this for many years the attention the prophetic impatience with the teacher can't you see?

can't you see the larger thing? why is it so narrow?

a conflict of oppositions which God himself has created which God himself has created male and female like that talk about opposites talk about differences so what does God do with the Jewish prophet?

so what does God do with the Jewish prophet?

he has him to marry a gentile from Denmark he has him to marry a gentile from Denmark Jewish prophet, the man of the tent and the altar Jewish prophet, the man of the tent and the altar the visionary moving through the nations with a gentile wife who wants a little white house with a picket fence who wants a little white house with a picket fence and the husband that goes out at nine and comes home at five and the husband that goes out at nine and comes home at five and security not the unknown where is the man?

what is he doing?

who embarrasses me humiliates me publicly people are offended at him for the way he speaks and she just wants to make nice make nice it's called the cross it's called the cross both for her and for me and we want to run in opposite directions and I should find a Jewish woman who is a believer and I should find a Jewish woman who is a believer with long black hair Hebrew with the Hebrews my kind God says no the genius of what I am about is not compatibility is not compatibility or human happiness but my glory which is revealed in reconciliation and those things which are opposed and those things which are opposed and those things which are opposed so if you have received any benefit through me in these days bless my wife it's her fault thank you Lord thank you Lord so look at the details that were given here not only prophets and teachers Barnabas and Simeon was called Niger Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen which had been brought up with Herod and Saul which had been brought up with Herod and Saul what a bag of motley differences what a bag of motley differences if a man is called Niger black is from Africa and the other guy is from Cyrene a Mediterranean race and someone descended from Rome and one is a gentile and the other is a Jew but when they were found worshiping the Lord together the Holy Ghost said then the Holy Spirit said prepare me for the work which I have called you for the work which I have called you and that's the beginning of apostolic sending and that's the beginning of apostolic sending Paul was a teacher in the body the other brother was a prophet in the body but when they were sent out from the body but when they were sent out from the body apostolic sending body we have the first apostles we have the first apostles turned the world upside down because they went out with power and authority because in the place of tension and conflict that was centuries old of jealousy and opposition and fear, prejudice between Jew and gentile and black and white and Roman and Hebrew they worked something through that they could worship the Lord together not singing choruses from an overhead projector not singing choruses from an overhead projector but the place of worship is the place of truth the place of true worship is the place of truth not the place of musicality not the place of musicality they did not so much as have a single electrical appliance they did not so much as have a single electrical appliance but they worshiped God but they worshiped God in spirit and truth which would not have been possible if there had been an unresolved difference a secret fear a secret prejudice a distrust because you're not like me you're not a Jew, you're a gentile and you guys have always been opposed I don't know if I can ever trust you black and white evidently Antioch was more than a church of services evidently Antioch was more than a church of services see how discreet the Lord is see how discreet the Lord is he doesn't give us the details he doesn't tell us how they arrived at this condition but when they arrived but when they arrived it was reflected in their worship not to alongside each other but to get together and then the Holy Spirit said separate from me a piece of this reality I want to send this into the world where men are cutting each other's throats where men are cutting each other's throats with his racial prejudice and dread and terror and misunderstanding I want to send a piece of this reality that you have perfected at Antioch to bring healing and answer to the world and power to bring healing and answer to the world and power and I will be with you and I will be your authority and you'll turn the world upside down and you'll turn the world upside down because the world is all wrong in its false systems in its phoniness, in its deceit in its makes believe in its advertising in its movies, in its TV programs in its phony romance stories it's a lie, lie, lie, lie and it's destroying personalities and it's destroying personalities who need to be brought to reality by men who come to them in reality sent once apostles who have met each other face to face who have met each other face to face in Romans chapter 10 In Romans chapter 10 in Romans chapter 10 and Romans 9 through 11 is the heart of the Apostle Paul is the heart of the Apostle Paul that deserves our most serious study is the heart of the Apostle Paul that deserves our most serious study and then he takes up the mystery of Israel and the church which is so central to the church which is so central to the church that the church that ignores this mystery that the church that ignores this mystery that the church that ignores this mystery and that he takes away his obligation to the Jew and that he takes away his obligation to the Jew loses any possibility of being apostolic the issue of being apostolic is the issue of Israel rightly understood and received in chapter 10 talking about his Jewish people and reminding us in verse 11 and reminding us in verse 11 whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but how shall they call on him but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be saved and how shall they preach except they be saved as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace Lord give me grace Lord give me grace don't let us sink here this is where the issue now really counts this is where the issue now really counts how shall Jews call upon him how shall Jews call upon him of whom they have not really heard of whom they have not really heard I lived in a Christian country for 34 years who remembered to pray I'm not at liberty to tell you now but one of these rabbis the oldest whom I have known for 30 years and have seen in every trip I've made to Monterrey something happened to him he was able to call able to pray calling on the name of the Lord because I was a sent one who could preach and bring the knowledge of him and the reality that this Jewish man was able to recognize and receive and receive the issue of apostolic preaching is apostolic sending because the word itself means sent one because the word itself means sent one because the word itself means sent one God's intention for you is that you would be the Antioch of Monterrey is that you would be the Antioch of Monterrey the Antioch of Mexico the Antioch of Latin America and out of the reality that you perfect because you will not turn away your faces because you will not turn away your faces because you will see issues through in righteousness, through mercy through righteousness, through mercy where God will meet with you you will come to a reality of a kind of true worship that when the Lord sees it this one, that one that they might be sent the issue of what is truly apostolic the issue of what is truly apostolic is the issue of salvation for the Jew is the issue of life or death is the issue of life or death when we find men of this kind who are sent out by the Holy Ghost because after the call came at Antioch because after the call came at Antioch the believers fasted and prayed and they laid their hands on Saul and Barnabas and they laid their hands on Saul and Barnabas and the scripture says so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went the scripture equates the laying on of the hands of ordinary men and women in the body the scripture equates the laying on of the hands of ordinary men and women in the body as being sent by the Holy Ghost because when you lay hands on someone because when you lay hands on someone you are communicating and conferring the truth and the reality of God in your own life in whatever degree you have it in whatever degree you have it that's why Paul was full of authority full of power he was reflecting a corporate reality he was reflecting a corporate reality by the laying on of clean hands hands that he could trust hands that he could trust because he knew these men and women because they were more than Sunday Christians they were more than sitting behind somebody's head because they were in daily intensive personal relationships he knew their lives, he knew their character they would test it and prove they could receive their hands and not suffer loss but have an impartation that he would then carry both out the Jew and Gentile and turning the world upside down and turning the world upside down are your hands to be trusted?

are they clean? have you diddled with the TV set? have you diddled with the TV set?

or scraped a coupon hoping to win a... or scraped a coupon hoping to win a... or scraped a coupon hoping to win a... is your life open and clear?

is your life open and clear?

and visible and correctable one with another and visible and correctable one with another this is what God is waiting for this is what God is waiting for if you want to be ascending body for the earth is crying out for the earth is crying out for true apostles who are sent in the authority of God who speak the word that brings the knowledge of the name and faith by hearing that creates faith where it didn't exist before that the person can call for whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved not men who are self-appointed not men who are self-appointed have a little following in a little religious system where one sends the other and the other sends the other where it seems that a certain man has some measure of authority and is impressive personally but is not himself a sent one sends himself self-appointed by some prophet who prophesied that he is an apostle where one confirms the other in some kind of a religious system that plays upon the great words but itself is not great and threatens and opposes those things that are truly apostolic are the realities that prevail today are the realities that prevail today we need to come back to the holy place where God meets with us face to face so let me conclude by reading you the comments on this subject by a great theologian the comments on this subject by a great theologian first time in the history of the church at Monterrey that a great theologian has been introduced to the general church and it's about time for these men are giants they are God's gift to the church and we need to receive their benefit to labor in the word and study in the original languages and to probe and open the great doctrines of God is not contrary to the faith nor the spirit but Pentecostals have been suspicious but Pentecostals have been suspicious if something requires mind and intelligence it's considered suspicious it's considered suspicious and contrary to the spirit but listen to this he raises the question how shall they call upon him and confess him as Lord if they have not believed in him how shall they hear without a preacher because preaching is a holy vocation it's not a profession it's not a skill you learn in school the man himself is the message his character and his life is caught up with his speaking is caught up with his speaking because preaching is holy it's not because the man has a certain gift of gab there's no higher vocation than to preach and he has to preach in such a way with such a message that it reaches and smites home to them in such a way as they cannot elude or escape it there's truth and truth there's truth in a doctrinal form there's truth in a doctrinal form in which we're saying the correct words and terms in which we're saying the correct words and terms but it doesn't register as truth it's hollow and it's shallow it's hollow and it's shallow because we have not internalized because we have not internalized we don't know its full reality and measure and though we speak it technically and though we speak it technically it falls to the ground it does not return to the Lord because he did not send it but the word that is sent but the word that is sent through a prepared glass that has been called and sent by God from a body who knows the man and laid hands upon him and sent him and continued to uphold him in prayer and continued to uphold him in prayer when he goes to four countries in Africa and mainland China what he speaks in those places is an event of the kind that you have been hearing and receiving in these days more precious than you presently know more precious than you presently know when we meet preachers like that when we meet preachers like that we cannot escape from his word because it penetrates and perforates because God is with them and in them and I will meet with them I will give you instructions I will be present I will be the nexus of your apostolic authority and power your word will not be an entertainment your word will be a requirement because whenever God speaks he does not speak to entertain he speaks to require it's a call those who hear the word and receive it, come up unto me and be there such men have to be sent this is a mission this is the backbone the heart of proclamation the word is more than just information the word is more than just information it becomes a point of encounter it's revelation it pierces and men who up to that time like my Jewish kinsmen who can discuss any subject and never get ruffled very cordial until they hear the gospel in the power of God apostolically expressed in power and the mask of civility comes off and the teeth are bare that gnash upon us one will either fall before the man who brings such a word and say men and brethren what must we do to be saved or they will gnash upon us and seek to destroy us that's why the apostles are almost always the martyrs they are a saver of life unto life unto son they are a saver of life unto life unto son they are a saver of life unto life unto son and a saver of death unto death unto others and a saver of death unto death unto others they represent God and they bear God they have that treasure in their earthen vessels they are wood and humanity that is gnarled and twisted with their history but they are encased in gold within and without imagine a whole church like that in Monterrey in Mexico imagine a church like that in Latin America and Jews will be passing through it how will they not be saved in the reality that they will see and the word they will hear that they cannot regainsay nor rebuke, repudiate it's a word of authority it's a sent word and the sender himself is in it we ourselves were modeling today my brothers and I we were talking about you we are men of broad experience and travel but I said where have we met a congregation like this where the speaker can speak for an hour and 45 minutes never losing the attention of the audience and the pastor gets up and himself speaks for 20-30 minutes and they hear and receive the entire thing so there's resurrection power in that speaking the same life of God that raised Jesus from the dead is the life, the animation of power in the speaking of those who are sent they are eminently the men of the resurrection their word and their persons are in full resurrection power they are already in the resurrection already in the eternal place Paul says I have my citizenship in heaven I have my citizenship in heaven yes I'm a Hebrew of the Hebrews but the things that constitute the truth of me are not drawn from the earth but from heaven and it's this heaven that I commend to men and to make touch the sense of it now and in this life unless it comes to them too late on the day of eternity when it will be too late to call on him who they have not really heard because no one had really preached and they have not heard because no one had really preached because no one had really been sent we have watched souls pass from death to life even this dear rabbi which I'm asking you to keep quietly to yourself we mustn't go out and boast about this the man is still alive with an oxygen tube in his nose maybe he has only days to live but he knows now where he's going and he has the peace that passes all understanding what is apostolic is real what is real is authentic what is authentic is God the apostle is the missionary of reality things as they in fact are things as they in fact are things as they in fact are things as they in fact are things as they in fact are as God sees them and as we have meant to know them in a world that lies in deception in a world that lies in deception it's a wicked one who's a liar from the beginning and needs to be confronted and the truth needs to be revealed because the true apostle not only speaks the message he is the message in himself he is the thing in himself and his character in his life through and through what then would such a church be but a glory to God forever but a glory to God forever so these men bear the power of the word because they bear the Lord himself because they bear the Lord himself they are encased in gold in the character of God which is beaten out of gold which is beaten out of gold they haven't learned this they haven't learned this in the school of convenience they learned it in hardship in heartache heartache struggle in opposition and if they can't find such opposition anywhere else in the world God will give it to them and their wives or they'll have it in the church or in their own family tension, conflict is the shaping factor beating something out of gold which should become itself and joy where God will meet with them and be with them as they are sent so do you desire this? or you just want to be a Pentecostal body nice services good biblical teaching good worship there's something more something higher there's a word that God wants to revive and the reality of that word apostle, apostolic sent the thing in itself having the character of God seeking nothing for itself knowing that it will either be received or opposed I will either cry out what must we do to be saved or seek to cast us over the hill and it's all the same we don't fear and we were just as content to remain at Antioch in worship as to be sent we have no itch to be ministers no ambition to be seen and heard we have no career to promote we are just as content to remain hidden and obscure in the place of worship together as in the place of sending separate unto me men who are already separated from their religious ambitions their racial and ethnic origins I'm more lightly complected than you I'm more Spanish you're more Indian these men have been separated from the deepest things that govern men and dominate men and lead from fear and tension to opposition they're liberated they bring the message of heaven they transcend their culture transcend their nationality they are the messengers of a heavenly way the reality of God and where do they learn it when do they come to it in Antioch in the church that was in Antioch made up of black and white and Jew and Gentile in all of the raw natural ingredients the church of diverse differences there in truth and in love in openness and humility in confession, communion they rose above, they transcended they were separated from the earthly things that poison and corrupt men and therefore could be sent the issue of Paul is the issue of Antioch he's not some magical thing in himself and if I have had any value for you in these days thank my wife the opposition, the tension, the difficulty thank my fellowship and my community the opposition, the differences everyone with his own thought and opinion with scriptures to prove it you want to spit your guts out it seems irreconcilable but you hold steady and you remain and you continue on face to face and you don't turn away and in that place God meets you and you will never have imagined and the brother that you thought was your worst enemy he becomes your deepest friend and ally because we continue to look in each other's faces and wouldn't turn away and so the issue of righteousness through the place of mercy I want to dedicate you as the Antioch of God for this city perhaps this nation we're not here by accident nobody else wanted us you took us in and have received the benefit we have an authority to preach and to teach but also to bless preach and to bless to bless to bless to bless to bless to bless priestly authority to confer blessing which is more than just a nice feeling but a conferring of something palpable and real that was not there before until it came through a sent one because the blessing is the Lord himself his prayer his desire receive it Lord in Jesus name a day of new beginnings not that we are in any way making little what has taken place till this moment from this pastor everything was given of God it was a preparation for now for the Cairo's time that has come the set time to favor Zion this Zion has come it's time for an apostolic reality in the nation of Mexico and in Latin America that can send forth preachers whose word creates faith and they hear it that they might be saved that perform the works of God that confront the authorities of the world and the things that are false and don't serve them so Lord in Yeshua's holy name I preach the apostle of all confession in your name in your name I bless this people let something come down to them from heaven from above to settle upon their souls to find its way into the very root and foundation of their corporate life a depth of understanding and of desire and appreciation and appreciation for that which is apostolic not just to admire it but to become it bless this Antioch Lord and make it a sending body and make it a sending body that this nation will receive the benefit the real thing the real thing that reveals the counterfeit simply by being the thing in itself a people who are able to discern that which is sent of God and that which is sent of man who are able to identify those who say they are apostles and do not and do not because they themselves are living in apostolic reality and instantly can sense that which is false and presumptuous religious and human and are jealous of the truth and the reality of God of such a great word because they have a heavenly calling and they consider the High Priest and the Apostle of their confession even Jesus Christ in whose name we pray seal this Lord Amen
