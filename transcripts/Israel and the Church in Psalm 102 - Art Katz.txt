Israel and the Church in Psalm 102 - Art Katz

Well, you can turn with me to Psalm 102.

We are going to go into a lengthy, detailed exegesis of one psalm, or most of it, because it is a remarkable, apocalyptic, and eschatological psalm.

Sorry about that.

I'm not saying that to say, look, my no hands aren't those two Greek words, but to say that we all have obligation to know those two Greek words and what they stand for. The things that are eschatological, the eschaton is the coming of the Lord Himself, the end, the glorious end, the consummation. Eschatology is the study of those things that pertain to the end, but the end is also apocalyptic. That is to say, it is accompanied and takes place in judgment, in fire, in great upheaval, in cosmic dislocations, in the movement of peoples, in judgment.

And so that's how the age concludes.

And the church that is the church, both at its inception and at its conclusion, especially now, is both eschatologically minded and apocalyptically expectant. If you miss those two foundational dispositions, you lose the very dynamic of church as church. And part of the process and purpose of God is to restore those dimensions to the church today.

Remarkably, they both have to do with the Jew and with Israel.

And it may well be for that reason it has been lost to the church, to the degree for one reason or another that we have excluded or divorced ourselves from the things pertaining to Israel and the Jew. By that same degree, we have lost the eschatological and apocalyptic content and dynamic of the faith. Those dimensions bring an urgency to the church, a sense of expectancy, of high seriousness for which nothing else can be a substitute. And for the want of them, we see a church compelled to design programs and think of spurious kinds of activities that will fill the void. But there's no substitute for the authentic thing that God and His great wisdom has given and intends. So may we become alive and aware and come into these great apostolic consciousnesses.

And Psalm 102 will serve as a very great introduction.

I don't know how much time we can give to the first part of the psalm, but I want you to hear this and read this as if we're hearing the description of a man in a concentration camp.

He sounds very much like the kind of recent victims of the Nazi time, and yet the psalm speaks of the future. It's eschatological.

And I suspect that God, by His Spirit, inspiring the psalmist, has given us a statement of that which is future. And I'm reminded of this, that in my own visit to Auschwitz, and I am assuming everybody knows what that word refers to, although I should be cautious because I was a high school teacher, and I stood before a generation of students that didn't even know that there was a World War II or that there was a systematic annihilation of six million Jews, which was the most significant and impactful element in my own consciousness growing up through that time to become a teacher and to find that the generation before whom I stand have never had obtained any awareness of that recent history. And it's remarkable how quickly it is swept under the carpet or forgotten when it needs all the more to be cherished, remembered, and understood.

Well, I visited Auschwitz.

In fact, I think I've seen just about every place of annihilation in Germany, Poland, and Europe.

Every time I travel, if I'm near one, I'll go out of my way to visit it.

And Auschwitz is the name of the original Polish army camp that was commandeered by the Nazis and made the first kind of place of systematic annihilation. But it was too old and limited in its possibilities, so three kilometers away, at a place called Birkenau, they put up the last word in systematic annihilation with a sea of barracks, gas chamber, and crematoria, with a railroad track going right up through the arch that said in German, Arbeit macht, how does it say, life's sweet.

Work makes life sweet, but it wasn't sweet, it was death.

And as the Jews came in these freight trains, they were met at the very platform.

Children were taken or babes out of their arms, thrown into the troughs.

A bird of gasoline and a doctor and an official would determine right on this spot who was to go immediately into the gas extermination and who would be put into the barracks while they could extract some labor for them. All that remains now is the husk and the ruins of the gas chamber and the crematoria.

The Nazis destroyed it as the Russians were coming in.

And all that remains are the foundations of these hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of barracks put up in keeping with German efficiency in an architectural pattern that made for this systematic annihilation that only the Germans seem to have the national genius to perform, aided and inspired, of course, by Satan.

And we looked out on that sea and found it was a perfect scenario. It was a gray, windy, melancholy day. It just gave you a chill to see this place in that kind of grayness.

And the brother who was with me said, Art, if you believe that there's yet a future Holocaust to come and that Jesus warned of it in his statement in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 when he was asked by his disciples, what are the signs of the end and of your coming? And among the things that he spoke he said, there's coming a time of trouble for the nation such as it has never before experienced nor ever will again. And except that that time be cut short, no flesh shall survive.

But for the elect's sake that time will be cut short.

And he makes it clear that it's going to have its inception in Jerusalem, flee to the hills of Judah and pray it doesn't come on the Shabbat, on the Sabbath. So we know that he's speaking of something yet future and yet it has to eclipse every past trouble known by the nation including the Nazi Holocaust.

And I believe that we can anticipate that.

That if the Nazi Holocaust took six million lives, this will take a yet greater number. We know that when the Lord comes, Israel is already so devastated, he comes as a deliverer for the nations that have come up against Jerusalem to destroy it, that two-thirds have already perished and one-third will pass through the fire and come to know him as Lord. And if that's the ratio of Jewish annihilation, not only in Israel but outside of it, we can say then of the 15 million Jews that are in the world, 10 million will expire in a coming Holocaust. So this brother said to me, how can that take place in a period of time shorter than that which processed this annihilation in the Nazi time, which was about ten years, 1938, seven years, 1938 to 1945, when we expect that the time of Jacob's trouble, this time of tribulation, we're led to assume is three and a half years. He said, how can such an extensive annihilation take place in so short a time with Jews globally not just confined to Germany or Europe, except that there be camps of this kind in many places of the earth where centers of Jewish population are?

I said I had never thought about that.

But it's a serious thought and a responsible thought, and Psalm 102 gives a suggestion of a victim in that camp at that time, and yet we can tell from the context that it's future because the victim comes to a kind of an awareness and consciousness that what he is suffering is not some arbitrary and inexplicable thing that has come at the hands of men, but comes directly from the hand of God as judgment. That kind of awareness had never come to the Jewish community in the Nazi Holocaust, but it will and must come in the future Holocaust to be, and it's in this Psalm.

So let's read it quickly. Hear my prayer, O Lord. Let my cry come to you. Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. There will be such a day. Answer me speedily in the day when I call.

So already we are on a kind of new ground because it was a rare Jew who had the disposition or the history with God that would call upon him even in distress. One of the things that perplex orthodox Jews and those of the Jewish community have sought to analyze because of the Holocaust are troubled by the thought that of all the Jews who expired, most of them were from Poland and were the orthodox, but the secular Jews particularly in America and the West were spared. Why is it that God took the most pious to be found among the Jewish community and brought them through a process of annihilation and spared Jews who are secular and not disposed toward God at all?

Well, if you read my Holocaust book, I try to answer that question.

At the end of the book is an addendum called Answers to a Critic, and a critic is one of the most well-known Jewish philosophers who states reasons why the Holocaust could not have been the work of God. It took a million and a half infants as victims and took not the most secular but the most religious, and so I attempt to answer his questions, and in doing so the Lord gives an incisive statement about the nature of judgment itself, that it must necessarily affect the innocent and raises the question of whether God is impressed with Jewish piety or not.

But here is a man crying out in the day of his distress. Incline your ear to me. There's a God, he believes, who is there to hear and answer me speedily in the day when I call, for my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. My heart is stricken and withered like grass. I'm too wasted to eat my bread. Because of my loud groaning, my bones cling to my skin. I'm like an owl in the wilderness, and like a little owl of the waste places. I lie awake. I am like a lonely bird on the housetop. All day long my enemies taunt me. Those who deride me use my name for a curse, for I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink. Well, this sounds like something that exceeds even the Nazi time.

As cruel as they were, there was not the kind of mocking taunt of Jews that we can more readily expect now in view of Islamic vindictiveness and hatred. There's something endemic and intrinsic to the Islamic personality that is not satisfied with mere cruelty or bringing its enemies into a place of subjugation, but requires their extreme humiliation and will taunt and mock them. And so that he makes that statement, all day long my enemies taunt me and those who deride me use my name for a curse, awakens for me a suggestion of something future and that will likely be fulfilled by the kinds of enemies to be found among those who subscribe to Islam not only in the Middle East but everywhere now in the world where Islam has its very strong footholds, including the Western world, Canada, North America, United States.

But here's the unusual thing in verse 10. Because of your indignation and anger, for you have lifted me up and thrown me aside. My days are like an evening shadow, I wither away like grass. But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever, your name endures to all generations.

I think God will wait for one thing to come from Jews in their hour of affliction and distress and acknowledgement that what they are suffering is not some arbitrary thing that falls upon them again without explanation. But in this calamity, as in all our calamities, God himself is the author and that what we are experiencing is a rod of chastisement that might come from the hands of men whether they are Muslims or Nazis but that the author of our distress is God himself and that he in his righteousness is required to bring these judgments upon us for our sins warrant them and God waits for that acknowledgement in order to bring out of this distress a redeemed remnant that will represent him rightly to the nations of the earth. Because of your indignation and anger and it's a righteous indignation and a just anger, and we Jews are ourselves the cause of it for as we are told in Jeremiah 30 and 31 in the classic statement of the time of Jacob's trouble, your sins will exceed that of your fathers. And every day now we're seeing Israel on a path towards sin that was inconceivable in less than a half century ago that Jews would use torture with suspected terrorists in order to extract information and other kinds of uses of violence that are totally unbecoming to Jews. And we thought that we were going to establish a nation that will be a model to the world of a unique Jewish kind, but alack and alas, in less than half a century by the force of circumstances we're compelled to act and conduct ourselves in such a way that it is a disappointment to us and an embarrassment to us and yet we're in such a grip that in order to sustain our life and to preserve the state we're required to employ such things as we would never have thought conceivable. That's why when I preach this more extensively I say to those Christian Zionists who want so much to see the present state to succeed that the intention of God in giving it was not its success but its necessary failure. And that we Jews who have turned a deaf ear to the word of God that says there's no man good, no not one, if God were to mark iniquity who can stand and that we call that Christian doctrine of the depravity of man is a Christian doctrine because we Jews are so intrinsically and powerfully humanistic and celebrate man. And that's why we celebrated Germany because it was the ultimate of human civilization and thought that it in fact was the model of a messianic conclusion to the age that would not come supernaturally by someone sent from heaven but would be the work of men to establish justice through civility and ethics and morality of which the Germans at that time were a supreme example. But alack and alas the very nation that we had trusted and so admired became the most inhumane. You see how this opens such a window on the ironic judgments of God that that which we had celebrated comes not only to haunt us but to destroy us. And that which we had elevated as being the most celebrated statement of humanity becomes the most inhumane. That it was not enough just to systematically kill us but to deprive us of identity to shear our hair to take the fillings out of our teeth to mark us with numbers and to degrade us until we were like the living dead. It was more cruel than what animals could perform and it came from the nation whose civilization we most admired. It's a sober lesson for all mankind as Israel itself is intended to be. That when we put our trust in man it will betray us and our greatest hope will become our greatest source of despair. And maybe we Jews will one day forgive Germany for the atrocity and the systematic annihilation of six million of our kind but will we ever forgive them for the disappointed failed expectancy that they raised in our Jewish hearts as to what Messianic civilization should be? And if we'll not take example from them must we not experience in ourselves a comparable failure? Because what could issue from man that would be an everlasting testimony to God more than a political state and a fulfillment of prophetic expectancy out of which all the nations of the earth shall be blessed?

Can we perform that? Can we establish that without God and say, well, look, no hands.

We Jews have such sufficiency and such capability that we can be fresh out of the concentration camps and still marked with their tattoo and within half a century we can resuscitate the dead language and establish a high tech civilization and be one of the great military powers of the world. Well, we've done all that but what is the character of the nation that we have established? And even if the violence were to end today with our Palestinian dissidents and the Arab nations round about us if some miraculous thing would happen by which the conflict would be ended we have already gone beyond a point of no return. We have already acted in such ways and allowed ourselves such conduct and thought such thoughts and spoken such words as to make our original intention irretrievable.

You cannot go back.

The moral character of the nation has been cast and it cannot therefore be the fulfillment of what God prophetically intended and will yet have.

But somehow the failure has to proceed the establishment of what can only issue from him. We have to learn the insufficiency of man.

That's what happened to me 38 years ago and must necessarily happen to this nation.

Why this nation? Because this nation is the epitome of man. This nation is the statement of human self-sufficiency.

This nation is the object of the admiration even of the church for its hit squad ability and its remarkable ingenuity and energy and the kinds of things that Jews succeed in against all odds cannot be the basis by which all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

It might impress but it cannot bless.

In fact the only thing that can bless is the life of God and that life can only issue out of a resurrection and that resurrection must require a death that precedes it and it's toward that death that this nation is now in progress. And when I say the nation not only the political state but the Jacob people throughout the world. So God has a pain evidently in this psalm an acknowledgement that was never forthcoming from those who suffered the Nazi holocaust but hopefully will issue from those who will suffer the holocaust to come because of your indignation and anger.

You have lifted me up and thrown me aside.

But you, O Lord, notice now the frequency of the word you reference to God.

You, O Lord, are enthroned forever.

Imagine a Jew saying that and if you're enthroned forever that means not only the future and not only the present moment in which I find myself with my skin hanging on my bones and I'm like a charred piece of humanity who cannot even eat his bread and is mocked and taunted but the forever includes the past.

That means that you were there in the Nazi holocaust.

You were there in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. You were there in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. You were there in the pogroms of Russia and Poland and the Ukraine and all of the persecutions and calamities that we have historically suffered all our history long.

You were enthroned in the heavens.

You cannot begin to estimate what this statement acknowledges and for which God waits and somehow it's only calamity that evokes an awareness of that. And if previous calamities have not sufficed to obtain it God will yet bring another and bring it with such an intensity and such a magnitude as that this cry will finally issue from the people for whom God waits for it to be expressed.

You are enthroned forever. It's a moot question to ask whether the church believes that. Really believes it.

Forever includes not only our happy times and our successes but also our own failures, our own calamities, our own disappointments, our own judgments. This is the all-inclusive acknowledgement of God in His great sovereignty that presides over history. And He will invest Himself in history and perform in time those things that must issue from Him.

And because we believe that there's a basis for hope. The Lord will come and He will save you.

We read in Isaiah 35, someone saying to Jews in a wilderness place whose hands are limp and whose hearts are faint and without hope, your God will come.

He will save you.

And when they hear that the eyes of the blind are opened and the deaf ears are unstopped and those that were lame and holed, leap for joy for a word has come to them in the place of ultimate strickenness and distress that gives them a basis for hope before there's ever any apparent indication that God will come. Because someone who is with them in the place of distress, who knows God and speaks with prophetic authority, is saying something more than a little humane pat on the back. He's saying prophetically, your God will come and He will save you.

I believe that that someone is the church of the last days.

Who knows that God will come prophetically more than doctrinally because they themselves have been submitted by God to those kinds of conditions where in their distress and in moments of seeming despair, He has come. What distinguishes a prophetic word from a teaching word is that the prophet is required to live his message. That the word has got to be not just a doctrinally correct word, but a word that comes up out of his gut, out of the inward being and experience of a man who in some measure has experienced that to which he is required to speak to others. And it's for that reason that we were expelled from our own property in Minnesota 15 years ago without explanation, a successful community after 10 years of struggle as community, summarily and suddenly required to abdicate the entire property and leave it to the vandals and to the northern Minnesota elements without explanation.

And the one brother, one of the three elders who refused to go because he would not receive my prophetic understanding of that requirement, was stubbornly going to remain and was then living in my house. I had already left. The Lord said to him, if you'll not leave, I'll kill you. And he left.

So we have experienced what expulsion and exile means, not in the measure to which it will be the experience of Jews worldwide and soon, but in a measure sufficiently to experience both expulsion and exile and return and restoration.

Why?

Because we have to speak both of these things to a Jewish people who must hear a prophetic word that will give them a basis for hope when there's no visible evidence for hope or they will expire. Anyone who's made any study of the Holocaust knows that the survivors were not necessarily the physically strongest, but those that had some measure of hope for whatever reason. Okay, so God has given us a little clue in what he is waiting for from his Jewish people. Only their acknowledgement that their plight, both presently and historically, is the result of God's anger, which is just and righteous and indignation that is deserved, and that he, you have lifted us up and thrown us aside.

But because you have done that and because you're enthroned, we can hope that you who have thrown us aside will also restore us. But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever. Your name endures to all generations.

I'll tell you, dear saints, the saliva begins to form in my mouth when I read statements like that, that my Jewish kinsmen are going to say to the Lord, you, your, to see him as not an abstraction or a category or a theoretical prospect of God as concept, but a God who hears, a you who can be addressed, a God who has been implicit in our history and in our destiny, and to say also, your name endures to all generations, because the depth of what is found in the Psalms and what is at the heart of what is Davidic and Hebraic is an acknowledgement of God of exactly this kind, that not only does he endure and enthrone forever, but his name endures to all generations.

It's not his moniker.

It's not a signification of verbalization of a name. Your name, what your name implies, what is intrinsic to your name, your character, your holiness, your truth, your sovereignty, your power, the beauty of your holiness, that endures forever.

This is acknowledgement of the deepest kind.

Is the Jew becoming a Jew, in fact, or to say, to become Hebraic, because the word Jewish is suspect. It comes out of our ghetto, exile experience, and that's why I do not encourage the Church to find its Jewish roots, but to find its Hebrew roots, for Jewish is culture, but Hebrew is spiritual.

And of course, it's easier to find that which is cultural than to find that which is spiritual.

But until the Church finds it and obtains it and is marked by this character that is Hebraic and Davidic, how shall the fullness of the Gentiles be come in? And the mystery is that it will not find it independent of its relationship with this people. This people will make an ultimate demand of us to be prophetic, to be able to say to them in their wilderness, wandering, and exile, and hopelessness and futility, your God will come. In fact, it will enable us to say to them, your bones will live, because when it's time for those bones to be addressed, when they will acknowledge that they are cut off and without hope, and our dry bones, so dry that there's no prospect even of the Son of Man believing that those bones can live, that's how God will so reduce world Jewry, because it is the epitome of human self-sufficiency and human self-confidence without God.

It is the celebration of man, and that's why we have to be such a textbook. That's why we have to be dealt with so ruthlessly.

We are a statement for all the nations and all the world, for they emulate and admire us in the very thing that God wants to reduce and to bring down.

So we've got to know that there's something more than our success. There's something more than our accomplishment.

There's something more than the great names that we have given to mankind like Einstein and Freud and Karl Marx and Steven Spielberg and all of the significant Jews who influence civilization. There's a name that exceeds all those names, and it's the one name for which we live and whose glory we desire, for when we come to that, we have come to our own destiny.

And here's a man crying out of concentration camp conditions. Your name endures to all generations.

When a man in distress as a Jew will say that more important to me than the relief from my distress is that your name should be known and should be exalted forever. When a Jew will come to that, he will have arrived at the destiny of his own calling.

And unless you help him to come to that, he'll not come to that at all. So this is an eschatological psalm.

It speaks of something yet future, but it encourages us to believe for it, and for that reason it's given. And now the Lord turns from this description of a man symbolic of Jews in an ultimate hour of distress as he continues to talk about God, you will rise up.

This even has a hint of resurrection expectancy. You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to favor it. For the appointed time has come, for your servants hold its stones dear and have pity on its dust. You, dear saints, this requires Holy Ghost communication. This requires revelatory power. This is so terse, so compact.

What is said here is so monumental that we are likely to miss it.

What is he saying?

That there's a God who will intervene, whose purposes of judgment will be fulfilled, and that the solution and relief for our distress is not to come from man, but will come from God, and it will come in an appointed time. And in fact it will be a set time that will release the compassion and the mercy of God, which alone is the answer to our predicament, for we deserve no consideration from God at all. If anything comes to us to bring us out of the distress that's described in the early part of the psalm, it's only because something comes to us out of Zion.

A deliverer comes out of Zion. As Paul speaks of it in Romans 11.

And where did he get it, if not from this psalm and other places in Old Testament scripture? That when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, so all Israel shall be saved as it is written. Does not mean necessarily every generic Jew, but those among them who are elect, the Israel that is Israel.

This time we're not cut short, Jesus said.

No flesh would survive, but for the elect's sake, the Israel that is the Israel, those upon whom I will have mercy, not by any qualification of theirs, but by the statement of what I am in myself. The deliverer will come out of Zion and take transgression from Jacob, for this is the covenant that I have made with them as it is written. What kind of a church is it that purports to exalt God and seek his glory and is not jealous for the fulfillment of that very verse? That he has made a covenant with them, unbelieving, apostate, blasphemous Israel, even if they are covenant defaulting, he is not.

I have made, I will keep. It's the issue of God, you dear saints. It's the issue of his name forever. It's the issue of his character.

It's the issue of his power that a covenant that he made, he will keep irrespective of the covenant failure of those with whom he has made it, because it is written. Because I have said it, because it is my word, I must therefore fulfill it, or how else then am I God, whose name will endure forever and whose praise will go up to the ends of the earth if I will not demonstrate and fulfill this with the people least likely to be the object of its success?

That's the drama. That's how the age concludes.

And we're not called to be mere passive observers of this conclusion, but to be prophetic participants. For when it's time to raise those bones, when they themselves will say in Ezekiel 37, verse 11, we are cut off, we are as dry bones, we are without hope, if you know anything about Jews, you'll know that's not a statement that they will make or ever has been made historically, that even the Holocaust could not bring such a statement to pass.

Instead, we have the other statement, never again.

If you go to Auschwitz and to Riesenstadt and Dachau, you'll see in every place, in great letters and in several languages, the word six feet high, never again.

That's a statement of another kind.

That's a statement of supreme human confidence that though you got us the last time, you'll not get us again. We were victims in our ghetto helplessness, but now we have nuclear capability and the world's number one air force and great military power and strategic weapons as we're exhibiting even now. We can knock off these terrorists in their cars, in their beds.

We've got it, never again.

God's waiting for a statement of another kind, not one that puts the premium on human competence and capability, but entire trust and confidence in God that acknowledges it is entirely without resource.

We are cut off. We are without hope. We are as dry bones.

And in that moment, God does not address the bones, but He turns to a son of man and He says to the son of man, I command you, prophesy to those bones.

How would you like to be part of that son of man corporately?

Even today, in your present spiritual condition, are you capable of responding to that command with prophetic authority?

Is there a desire in your heart to see those bones live? Or would you say they got what they have coming and let them lie? They had their chance and they blew it. You see how much rests on the church of the last days?

Not only its place of prophetic authority, which, by the way, does not grow on trees, it requires a history with God and dealings with God and submission to God and siftings with God.

Yes, the Lord has used me as a fine threshing instrument with sharp teeth to reduce hills to chaff and to dust, but what others don't know is, to what degree, cats, have you been reduced yourself? More than you can know and more than I'm able to say. In fact, I'll not allow any man to reduce anyone to chaff who is not himself first reduced and stays reduced. So do you qualify?

If the destiny of Israel, whose return, Paul says, is life from the dead, what a magnanimous statement. Paul is not saying that their return is a restoration and now they'll be privileged to have a real nation and it will endure, they'll not again be plucked out.

He's saying something much more.

If their falling away has been blessing to the Gentiles, what shall their return be but life from the dead? If they had been an influence in the world without God, what shall they be with God?

Much more, Paul says, when they are grafted back into their own tree. Much more.

As a nation of priests and a light to the world, for we are living in a sub-condition that God does not intend for nations. We're living without the activity and presence of a priestly people who teach the nations the difference between the sacred and the profane. How shall Israel fulfill that call when it is itself profane until it shall experience the holiness of God both in judgment, severity, mercy, and goodness? Can you see why they are on such a collision course and why for us to pray for the success of the State of Israel, however well-meaning and humanly desirable such an end is, is not in keeping with the remarkable purpose of God as our brother spoke yesterday. That must be fulfilled if this nation will be a nation of priests and a light unto the world, for that is their gift and their calling and it is without repentance, it's irrevocable, it must be fulfilled, though God is not God.

The issue of Israel's restoration is the issue of God, but he'll not do it sovereignly and independently of you.

You've got to come to one voice and one speaking when he shall command it that those bones can live. And if you lack that authority, if you lack that prophetic character and constituency, if you have shrunk from the conditions by which prophets are formed, which is a school of suffering, you'll be incapable. Not only that, you'll be not only inept, you will not even desire that those bones should live because you would have liked to remain where you were until the hand of the Lord came upon the Son of Man and brought him down and out and into the valley of dry bones.

He would not of himself ever have gone down there.

Who wants to look at that grisly horror of an Israel reduced to death as dry bones? We'd rather stay up at some loftier, charismatic level where we can hope for the success of the state and the other kinds of fancies that we can indulge if we shrink from and keep from seeing things as God himself sees them.

For that you've got to come down and out and into. Well, some of you have a little trouble in the faint beginning that I offered the other day.

How will you come into the grit of the reality itself, brought down by the hand of the Lord and the Spirit of God and into the midst of the dry bones and then commanded to prophesy after having acknowledged when the Lord said, when the Lord said, because this is a faith even beyond that which is understood to be prophetic faith. Its ultimate faith is the faith of the Son of Man himself to a prophet who is in union with the life of that God and its authority and its desire. We've not come to that place yet, but the issue of Israel compels us.

So not only must there be a faith, but a faith that works by love. Don't give the Lord this schmaltzy sentimental stuff. Oh, I think Jews are cute. Oh, I like them. I've always had a feeling. That's nice. But it's not the love by which faith works. The only love by which faith works is God's love, which is unconditional.

And the ironic thing is that our sentiment and disposition that we so enjoy is the very impediment to the receiving of that divine alternative. When we'll clutch the human substitute, sentiment, shallow affection, there's no way that God is going to impose upon us the thing which is divine any more than he can impose upon us a language, an unknown language of tongues if we insist upon keeping our own. And it's remarkable how people are loath to relinquish their sentiment, their emotion, their identification, the things that are familiar and dear. That must all come to death in the church in order for the life of God to replace it by which alone an authority and command that works by love will raise Israel to bless all the families of the earth.

Well, I'm giving you a whole seminar in one session and I haven't even gotten to the heart of this text. You will rise up and have compassion on Zion for it is time to favor it because the appointed time has come.

Not the kronos, the kairos, K-A-I-R-O-S, the Greek word that speaks of not just a time but a set time. And how does the Lord know that it's the set time and that he's free now to move and to bring deliverance to a nation that is totally undeserving?

Because his servants have compassion on her stones and have pity on its dust.

What a remarkable statement that God has restricted his own desire to be Israel's deliverer waiting for something external to Israel itself that will not come from Israel being dead but must come from someone called his servants.

Why didn't the psalmist just come right out and say the church?

Because it's not a language that would have been appropriate in the thousands of years ago in which this psalm was written. But the servants are evidently not Israel for Israel is the one needing the deliverance. The servant is someone outside from Israel and yet has a relationship as a servant's son to God that can only be descriptive of the church.

But a church of what kind? A church that will have compassion on her stones and pity on her dust. The psalmist is not talking about archeology. These are not ancient ruins.

They are the ruins of present-day Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, and every city in the present state of Israel will be reduced to rubble and to ruin. The world will gloat over this when it comes and enjoy celebrating Israel's disaster because all the world is unregenerate and is intrinsically anti-Semitic and hates what God loves and wants to see their demise and the more cruel the better.

They will be gloating but in the earth there's a people of another kind who have compassion on those stones and pity on that dust. Dear saints, this is prophetic language. This is psalmist terminology. This is poetry. This is not just a distant admiration.

This is profound identification with Israel in her judgment and in her distress. A condition which is not ours now and must be ours then for the Lord waits for it and when he sees it and he finds it, he's free to act.

The set time has come. What he has waited for in the church has been obtained.

An identification with the people who are suffering judgment for their despicable sins and while all the world is gloating, there's a people who have such commiseration, such an identification with this sinful people even in their judgment that they identify with them and share with them in their distress. It's not unlike Jesus commencing his messianic ministry by going into the waters of Jordan to be baptized when it was a place only for sinners to repent and that John the Baptist was astonished that Jesus would even enter those waters and the desire to be baptized of him. But Jesus said it's necessary for righteousness' sake for the righteousness is the Son of God who does not remain on the shore and look down at the pitiful sinners who acknowledge their condition and repent but joins them in those waters as if he himself were one with them in their sin. I want you to know that that is God's very nature and that's why the heavens opened over the Son of God emerging out of these waters and the voice of the Father cried out, this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased.

What he has done is indicative of me.

His identification with his nation in their sin is what I am as God. For even those Gentiles whom I will bring into the faith I have loved and I will save them while they are yet in their transgression and in their iniquity.

While they're yet sinners, I will die for them.

I will find a church in the earth that shares my heart and has my nature and my character and will reveal it toward Jews in their last days distress, the end of the age has come. And Israel is ready to be restored at a church who are his servants have come of age.

And I haven't even yet come to the punch line.

But in keeping with what our brother shared with us of the purposes of God that pertain to the nations which is Israel's whole destiny and purpose for being. That's why Jesus overthrew the money changers tables in the courtyard of the Gentiles for you have made my house a house of merchandise. You have disfigured and corrupted it in the very place that is supposed to be a place of prayer for all nations. Instead of attacking the priesthood in their place of sacrifice, he ventilates his anger in the place that is intended and designated for Gentiles for the nations because that is Israel's holy ultimate purpose for being. And they have turned that purpose into merchandise and have become thieves and have robbed the nations of the very place for which God has created Israel by their apostasy and turning into commerce what God intended as holy.

What do we read in verse 15? The nations will fear the name of the Lord. And all the kings of the earth your glory. For the Lord will build up Zion. He will appear in his glory. How does he appear? He appears in his intervention. He appears in his mercy.

He appears in his compassion and his kindness to a people who are totally undeserving of the same. And how is it visible that all nations can see it? The appearance is coming through the conduct of his servant people who are everywhere in the earth and are exhibiting an identification with Israel in her sin in such an evident compassion and mercy that is not to be explained humanly that the nations themselves have got to by that demonstration acknowledge that God is God.

The nations will fear the name of the Lord.

They will have seen such a demonstration that cannot be in any way humanly or religiously explained. That comes from Gentiles who ought to be sharing the world's delight in Israel's distress and instead they're manifesting and exhibiting an identification and a oneness and unity with this people in their distress.

As if those people are their brethren. Ha ha ha. As if the wall has really come down of separation while they are yet sinners God died for them.

And while they're yet sinners when you'll die for them when you'll extend yourself sacrificially and make of your body a living sacrifice and if you're going to be with them in the wilderness place to tell them that their God will come or get caught in any way in helping them in the hour of exile and flight you'll suffer what Corrie Ten Boom suffered and others in the Nazi time and go into their concentration camps and suffer their death. Show me a Gentile willing to do that for another and I'll show you the Church of the last days that has come of age. That has moved with boughs of compassion for a people whom all the world despises but God loves because His love is unconditional and has not to do with what they deserve. And we ourselves are free from these Pharisaical criteria to whom it will be that we will extend ourselves if they deserve it. We are in such union with God that we cannot do anything other than being righteous than to love them and have a compassionate concern for them and extend ourselves to them though it does not bring us any profit and brings us even into peril. When the world sees that they will fear the name of the Lord for there will be no human or religious explanation that will suffice but that this is the very evidence that God is God.

So don't tell me we're majoring in the minors and we're off on a little tangent about Jews because I'm Jewish. It has not a cotton-picking thing to do with the fact that I'm a Jew.

God had to give all this by revelation out of seasons of death as because of my call to the Church and given this understanding to communicate for the Church is the factor by which Israel's redemption will finally be obtained. What a Church of what kind who can make those bones to live because they do not only speak with prophetic authority they speak with divine compassion. It's a love that makes faith work and that love is his for those who are in union with him and this is what you're scared of. You want to retain your own autonomy and your own individuality and your distance if God will only help you and give you this that you might do that but for it to be dissolved into God where you cannot say where the son of man ends and God begins is our own annihilation but a coming into union with him that makes the Church the bride for the bridegroom.

And you'll not come to that independent of this. You can stand on your head. You can do exercises.

You can be spiritual and desire the sanctifying work of God and praise God for it and it will come essentially in the Church and demanding relationships but the final finishing score by which this union is a pain for no other ground will be the means of God's fulfillment except the grounds of union with himself in resurrection, life and power.

And it's not only his power it's his character. It's what he is in himself.

Compassionate and forgiving and loving without qualification and the test of it has always been the test of the Church is the Jew.

Whatever it's going to take, God is going to have it. For the set time must come by which he favors Zion.

And it's not something that will come from an Israel that is inert and done in. It will be from those who called his servants and the indication will be what their attitude and relationship is with this despicable people whose cities are now in ruins and are now expelled and are adrift in exiles in the world and in all nations. Then he will appear in his glory not only in his deliverance but in the character of his people who are like him that even the world must take note of it and fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth your glory for his glory is his mercy. When Moses said we'll not go up except your presence be with us, show me now your glory he hid him in the cleft of the rock and he let his goodness pass before him. He showed Moses his chesed the Hebrew word for tender kindness, for loving mercy. Moses asked for his glory, God showed him his mercy, for God's mercy is his glory and the nations will see God in his glory when they will see his mercy to a people least deserving the people of Israel in the moment of their greatest shame God will deliver them because the set time has come. He will regard the prayer of the destitute and that's not the prayer of Jews, destitute though they are not capable of praying. I think it will be our prayer in the sense of destitution that what we are called to is so beyond any ability in ourselves and everything seems stacked against its success that we ourselves are weak, poverty stricken which is remarkable how often that's the very nature and character of the prophetic men. He may sound like a lot of bravado, he may sound like he's full of confidence in what he's saying but what he is in the truth of his condition is a bundle of tremblings. He's destitute in terms of what he's called to perform and so will we be in that day. I brought my Oswald Chambers today on his selection on the word destitute where he says we have to realize that we cannot earn or win anything from God we must either receive it as a gift or do without it. The greatest blessing spiritually is the knowledge that we are destitute and until we get there our Lord is powerless. He'll not act he'll not convey, he'll not give so long as there's any measure in us that we are able to perform or to obtain it. When you're destitute when you're conscious of your own poverty and your own inability then the Lord is gracious to hear and to answer. We have to enter into his kingdom through the door of destitution and Israel will enter into her kingdom glory through our destitution. As long as we are rich, possessed of anything in the way of pride or independence God cannot do anything for us. The gift of the essential nature of God is made effectual in us by the Holy Spirit. He imparts to us the quickening life of Jesus which puts the beyond within and immediately the beyond has come within it rises up to the above. Isn't it remarkable that at the very end of the age and the consummation of things pertaining to Israel what God waits for in order to act is the destitution of the church the acknowledgement of its own inadequacy, the acknowledgement of its own poverty, the awareness that is called to something beyond anything in itself to perform however charismatic. That if God be not God we are of all men most to be pitied. How shall we call a nation to resurrection unless we ourselves in our destitution have experienced first that provision and many of us have fallen short of it and give only a verbal and doctrinal acknowledgement of resurrection because we have not in fact lived and moved and well and had our being in it. We have not had to because we can perform anything and everything out of our own human excellency until we are brought to a condition of such a kind as Israel will represent that is beyond what we can perform.

Can you see the genius of God? Can you see the mystery of God?

Can you see the awesome thing that will reveal his glory to all nations?

And you think that this is hitting on a minor note? And that this is distracting attention from Jesus? Or is it the very means by which the king comes?

So let this be recorded for a generation to come in verse 18 so the people yet unborn may praise the Lord. This is so in keeping with the conclusion of Romans 11 for of him and through him are all things to whom be glory forever. Paul is saying this thing of Israel's restoration through the church that has come of age in the very process of being to Israel what it must is God's final act in history and when it is complete there will not be another occasion. It's his glory forever but it is affected in time and we are moving toward that set time even now. Let this be recorded for a generation to come because they'll have to look back on this remarkable saga of redemption through a Gentile church to give God the praise and acknowledgement that will reverberate through all generations to come for there will not be another historic occasion in which it will be revealed or performed. That he looked down from his holy height from heaven the Lord looked at the earth to hear the groans of the prisoners.

This is very literal. These Jews will find themselves in captivity. They will be expelled to the farthest corners of the earth. They will be in chains where there is no prospect of human deliverance.

But the Lord himself will come to set free those who are doomed to die so that the name of the Lord may be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem when peoples gather together and kingdoms to worship the Lord.

How do you remain seated? Why are we not on our faces?

Look at the supreme conclusion to which this psalm brings us. Not only Israel's restoration not only the church coming of age in such union and identification with God we can entrust his prophetic authority to them to raise Israel by its own prayer. Not only nations observing the glory of God in such a visible reality before all nations and not only a praise that will reverberate through all ages to come but it will be declared in Zion, in that literal hill and in that city of Jerusalem when his peoples gather together and kingdoms to worship the Lord. The final consequence of all this is all of the earth acknowledging that Jesus Christ is Lord. Every knee bending and every tongue confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord. That the King who is the son of David is seated on the throne of David in a restored nation in a redeemed Zion.

And all the nations will serve him.

They will learn from their idols to serve the living God for something has happened in history a demonstration has come of so notable a kind that all the kings and all the nations must take note that there's a living God and the evidence is not only in the severity of his judgment that has come to his ancient people but also the mercy and goodness that has come in kindness through his church. The church has broken through her own preoccupation with herself as a false center by its final ability to identify compassionately with the fallen Israel and with Christ and his compassion in the same love by which God loved us while we were yet enemies. This coming of age, this replicating God, this being to Israel what God has been to us for which the Lord has waited releases him to be a deliverer to Israel before the face of all nations and causing those nations to fear the name of the Lord and bow to his majesty for the greatest visible demonstration of God which has been long hidden appears in his glory when he restores and builds up Zion. Because he looked down from his holy height because he heard the groans of the prisoners and because he heard the prayers of the destitute so that his name will be revealed what he is in himself and his power will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem and all nations will come up to pay their obeisance their respect and their acknowledgement of what God has done that having abased a nation he now exalts it because they have followed him in a road to Calvary and abasement and humiliation being marred more than any man before all nations now he exalts the nation that has been brought all the way down to be the center of his theocratic rule over all creation out of their Zion. No wonder the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion with everlasting joy upon their heads not only because of the knowledge will not again be plucked up and out but because God has reserved for them a name and an honor and a distinction by which they will be called who acknowledge God is our righteousness. Nations will come up on the Feast of Tabernacles to celebrate the work of God in that nation that he has exalted and to receive of them and through them the priestly ministration that God intended for that nation from the first for all nations.

If this is majoring in minors I don't know what a major is.

If this is some alternative to Christ, if this is not glorifying him who waits to take that throne and can only take it when they shall say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. I don't know a more urgent message that is Christ centered or makes as much requirement of the church and indicates its destiny that it cannot fulfill independent of him and his power and the union with him in his life which is not only his power but his character.

So I want to pray for such a church.
