The Apostolic Heart - Art Katz

Draw out the Lord's heart tonight in what is to be shared from Acts chapter 16, an episode in the life of Paul, that in it we can identify certain essential aspects of what is distinctively the genius of that which is apostolic, all the more because it's performed unconsciously in the same way that Paul's writing goes beyond any thought of himself that it would one day constitute part of the holy writ, and all the more because it's artless and unselfconscious does it more greatly exhibit the genius of what is apostolic. I want to start with verse 5 of Acts 16, and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily, and when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, they would come to Mysia. They assayed or they tried to go into Bithynia, but the spirit suffered them not. A day passing by, Mysia came down to throw us, and a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying, come over into Macedonia and help us, and after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them. Therefore, losing from Traos, we came with a straight course to Samothracion the next day to Neapolis, and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and the colony, and we were in that city abiding certain days, and on the Sabbath day we went out of the city by the riverside, where prayer was wont to be made, and we sat down and spoke unto the women which resorted there, and a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, which worshiped God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened, and she attended under the things which were spoken of Paul, and when she was baptized in her household, she besought us saying, if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there, and she constrained us.

Let's pause there.

There's much to consider already, because this is the advent of the gospel coming for the first time from Asia into Europe, and if it had not come to Europe, it would not have come to you. This is a critical transition time, and Europe was considered barbaric. Asia was the more prominent place of culture and the circulation of Judaism, religion, faith, so this is a critical crossing over, but we ought to note how it takes place. The churches were being established and increased in number daily. Paul and Silas were flourishing in their success, and then abruptly, as they sought to continue in that success, they were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.

Consider that and be staggered by that.

Will the Holy Ghost contradict himself, who said, go into all the world and preach this gospel to every creature? Can he then forbid the preaching of what he himself has proclaimed? It's a paradox, and it makes an ultimate requirement of the men who are bidden to stop in the midst of their success. When God can stop men in the midst of their success, he really has them.

It's a remarkable phenomenon.

How is it that Paul, being the man that he was, did not think that this was the enemy, mocking God, imitating God, and discouraging a further continuation in the place where success was being given? That would have been the logical way to dismiss this as not being God. This is the mocker, this is the imitator, this is the presumer.

We can discard this and continue on. Why am I saying all that?

Because it shows how acute is the spirit of Paul to discern God, despite the tension of what is being considered in that moment, that he did not miss the mind of the Lord.

He might have, unless a saint might have, we would have. We would have said, that could not be God.

How many times have we said, that is not God, and it was God, because it was God acting in a way contrary to our knowledge of him and understanding, coming into a new way that we had not understood had been challenged before.

This is crisis, saints. This could not be missed. This moment could not be missed.

If Paul was not the man that he was, and able to discern rightly that this was the Holy Ghost stopping, because the Holy Ghost is not always a patent green light to go on, the true work of responding to the spirit of God is to be able to stop as well as to go. And to stop in your success shows that the Lord really has the man.

He was not deceived, nor was Abraham.

Take thine only son whom thou lovest, and make of him a sacrifice.

Could that be God? When is God endorsing pagan human sacrifice?

In the most crisis moments in redemptive history, the giants of the faith are faced with challenges of a kind that are ultimate and hinge on knowing God as God, discerning his still small voice, catching the accent at this position that the enemy cannot mock, cannot imitate, because they have a history with that God, because they have been dealt with by that God, they know his voice. He can command them even contrary to logic, even contrary to what God had already said, going into all the world.

Well, how can we go and then you stop? And you know what? God does not need to explain himself.

There's not a word here that Paul asks for further elaboration of clarity. The Holy Spirit said stop, he stopped. They tried to go on again, and they were stopped yet again. The Spirit suffered them not.

The Spirit would not allow.

Sons of God are led by the Spirit of God, not only to go and to do, but to stop from doing when it pleases the Lord, so to curtail them. This is the way this episode begins, and this is what we need to dote upon and dwell upon, because here is the genius of apostolic obedience predicated upon relationship with the Lord.

Who shall go for us? Whom shall I send? Some amateur? Some Johnny-come-lately? Someone wet behind the ears? Some presumer? Some charismatic hotshot? Who shall go for us? Where are the candidates that in going for us, they go for us. They have not an agenda of their own. They have nothing to prove. They have nothing to demonstrate. They have no ministry to perpetrate, no reputation to uphold. They go for us. They're with us. They have no other intent.

They're sons of a father, and their only intention is to glorify him in perfect obedience, even when it contradicts every category of their religious understanding.

Is that where you are tonight? I don't think so. If you were, I would not be speaking this, but it's where you need to be.

Listen, dear saints, this is the foundation of the church as the apostles and the prophets, and we're catching a glimpse of what it means to be apostolic, not just in the setting forth of its abstract principles, but in the demonstration of the actuality and action as they're walking and serving and going and doing. They are explicating and setting forth the quintessential elements that constitute apostolicity without even being conscious of it.

In fact, if you're conscious of it, you're no longer doing it. Your self-consciousness will ruin it.

It's got to be selfless, mindless, perfect obedience, men born by the Spirit that can be stopped. And then a vision comes at night, a Macedonian.

We'll find that later. They never do meet that man. It's women that get saved.

And yet God was pleased to communicate what the new direction is, never before undertaken, to come into Europe for the first time. Macedonia, a man beseeching him, come help us. Here's the beautiful capstone, verse 10. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go. One man saw the vision, but we endeavored to go. Here's the genius of the church. Here's the body of Christ.

Here's submission to authority.

Here's men who are rightly related to the one who was appointed to receive the vision.

And if he receives it, we go.

My wife is still arguing with me 32 years after that we ever had a call to Northern Minnesota.

It never came to her. It only came to me. It cannot come to her. It can only come to the head.

But those who are related to the head and submitted to the head need to submit to the vision that the head has received and not think that they can obtain an independent confirmation of their own.

Supposing they had a dispute. Supposing there would be a debate. Supposing Silas would say, well, can that be true?

Go to Macedonia and leave the field of ministry where we're succeeding and the church is being added to daily.

I don't know about you, Paul. What did you have for supper last night? This may be indigestion. Immediately. Don't you love that word? We assuredly gathered.

Listen, dear saints, that assured gathering and that immediate response is not something predicated in the moment.

It has a history.

And that history took place in Antioch.

Those men were tempered together. They were worshipping the Lord together. They had gone through things together. They knew the character of Paul. They were formed so that when the moment of obedience was required, it didn't have to be haphazard.

There was a history that made it clear that there would be an immediate response.

They would assuredly gather. Is the church in that condition now? We don't even know what submission means. We're independent. We're autonomous. We do our thing.

And therefore, we're falling short of apostolic glory. This is going to culminate in apostolic glory and require this kind of obedience, this kind of immediacy, this kind of assurance that the Lord had assuredly called us. What a union between Paul and his colleagues that was informed in the moment but already had a history and was tested.

Don't come to this by magic. This is no magical wand waved over men to bring them to agreement. There's a dealing. There's a history. There's a relationship.

There are things that have been talked out and worked out between these men that when the moment of God comes, they can assuredly gather. The Lord had called us.

Are you in that kind of relationship? It'll cost you something to be in it.

We are a church of a conglomerate of individualities seated alongside each other but not together, not related, not submitted, not acknowledging authority. There's an independence in us that falls so short of this apostolic pattern and glory. Therefore, we need to behold it, appreciate it, esteem it, and desire it. And so they set forth with a straight course and came to the capital city. And on the Sabbath day, verse 13, we went out of the city. Oh, Paul, if only you had gone to a school of evangelism, you would have learned that on the Shabbat and the Sabbath, you don't go out of the city. That's when the people come into the city, into their synagogues, into the places of worship.

Go out is to lose your opportunity.

And you went out and you went along the riverside and you found some women who were disposed to prayer and there you spent your time and gave your substance to some women.

You missed it, man. Anyone knows the most elementary lessons of evangelism. You go where the action is.

So why did you leave the city on the Sabbath?

Where does it say?

God said, you leave the city and go out by the riverside and there you'll find some women who are disposed to prayer and there you'll preach.

Not a word like that. What moved him? He needed a vision of a Macedonian.

He needed a check of the Spirit and now there's no indication of any operation of the Holy Spirit that says go out of the city.

I think it was a hunch.

I think it was an inward disposition or just a sense of things because he was in communion in the holy place. He took advantage of the new and living way made by the blood of Jesus to come into the holiest place of all where he meets with God to receive instruction, disposition that is so faint that to say that still small voice is to be exaggerating. I don't think Paul had anything more than an intimation.

Somehow the city was not right.

Somehow his disposition was to go out not knowing what he would find and so much rests on an obedience to the faintest intimations of the Spirit as one would to a vision or to the clear call of God by the Spirit that says thus saith the Lord.

The one is as critical as the other.

In fact ultimately more demanding because it's not a still small voice, because it's not loud, because it's not a command. I told you that the times of my weepings have been few but one of the most profound weepings in my early Christian life when I was a young Jewish believer, hot shot, full of intentions for God. I came to hear a speaker at a full gospel breakfast meeting. He said when I was younger, he said, I was so concerned to obey the commandments of God. I said amen brother, amen.

That's me.

But he said as I have gone on with the Lord, I no longer wait for his commandments. I respond to the very intimations of his Spirit. And when I heard that I fell right out of my seat under the table weeping.

I didn't know that there was such a prospect, such a dimension that we don't have to wait to be commanded. To be commanded is manner in the wilderness while you're immature.

But in the land, the Lord has needed only to inflect his disposition.

You sense his heart, his will. What a dimension.

But to know that dimension and respond to that dimension requires such union, such sensitivity, such oneness with God and a man who is free from any design of his own.

Totally free.

That the faintest intimation is enough.

Go out of the city. It confounds your categories. We should be where the action is, where the crowds come. Out of the city. Did God say so? No. He intimated.

And the intimation is as powerful as the saying. If you can hear it, if you're disposed to receive it and to obey it even though it contradicts your categories.

I will not assure your success. All you saints have a long way to go. Long way to go. We all have a long way to go. This is the way.

This is the genius of what is apostolic. It's laid out for us out of the actual experience of flesh and blood men like us unto ourselves. As much desiring to succeed for God as we and yet able to be stopped, able to be redirected by the most subtle emanation of the disposition of God so faint as to be almost indiscernible that can only be picked up by those who are disposed toward him and have no agenda of their own that will block it.

We'll see what reward we get for that obedience.

Well, there was a certain woman named Lydia, God bless her, who worshiped God and heard us whose heart the Lord opened that she attended to things which were spoken of Paul. And when she was baptized in her household, did you read that?

Boom, boom, boom. Her heart was opened.

The Lord gave her the word. And when she was baptized in her household, what a conversion on the spot. She heard the word of God from Paul and it resulted and required an immediate response on her part because Paul and Silas will soon enough leave. But this woman will bear the public stigma and reproach of having been baptized by them before observers.

But it did not in any way impede her obedience.

She really received the word and acted on it when a baptism like that in a pagan society is a death sentence.

She didn't say, well, let me think about this. Where do I find the text? I want to review this subject. Baptism is a radical thing. Can't I just believe and later on maybe decide?

She and her whole household, what an effectual word went forth from Paul that was acted upon immediately without regard to the consequence that she would face after their departure.

That's a convert.

That's why Paul in Thessalonica says, you know, the kind of man that I was among you, that the word that you heard from me was not the word of man, but the word of God that performs a work in them that believe. You turn from your idols to serve the living God and to wait for his son Jesus who comes from heaven and will save you from the day of his wrath. Paul must have brought some message, such power. People compelled to make consecrations when baptism was a death sentence, as in fact it ever and always is. And until it's a death sentence for you, you're not appropriating what God has intended for you to find in those waters. If you only got wet, if you only fulfilled a religious obligation, you never intended to die.

It didn't require your death.

In fact, it was quite a customary thing and you wore a white robe or it was a happy church occasion.

Baptism is a burial, dear saints.

Those who come to the end of their lives, not just the putting away of their evil, their sin and their bad traits and habits, but they're good, they're nice, which is just as evil, perhaps more so because it purports to be good.

There's no thing good in man.

The natural man deserves only a death sentence and Jesus has provided a union with himself in the waters of baptism by which that death can be inflicted. That there might be a resurrection unto newness of life. That's why so many of us are falling short of that glory, because our baptism was only a religious requirement. We had no intention to die. We were not told that we were going into a death. We weren't persuaded that to go under the water was to be buried.

This woman is.

And she was willing because she had passed from death to life. She heard the word of God with her whole household and she will become the formative inception of the church of Philippi, because God always invariably starts with a woman.

She constrained us to abide in her house.

If you have judged me to be faithful in verse 15 to the Lord, come into my house and abide there.

And she constrained us.

Hey, this woman is heaping reproach upon her head. These Jewish upstarts are going to leave soon enough, but she'll remain and be identified as the woman who took in these dangerous radical Jews who are soon enough to turn the world upside down. These men being Jews do disturb our city.

Come into my house and abide there. This Lydia is precious beyond all speaking.

So precious in God's sight that it was worth taking Paul out of the city and bringing him to the distant place where she was that she might hear the word, receive it, be saved, and be baptized. How critical she was to the formation of the church of Philippi, because the Lord knew and foresaw and perceived her precious heart who worshiped God in the measure of knowledge that she had.

How far he will go for one.

It has not to do with numbers, you dear saints. Being in the city may have guaranteed more numbers, but the issue is not numbers.

The issue is the will of God for one. And if you're number oriented, you're apostolically disqualified. If you measure your success by your numbers, you're out of it.

You measure your success by your obedience to the intimation of God that will lead you to the one of his intention. And even if there's not one and you're evidently fruitless, your obedience is more pleasing in his sight than anything that would have been produced by your religious labors and your seeking for numbers.

That number thing is a curse. It's not an apostolic mentality. It's religious.

So it came to pass in verse 16, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masses much gained by soothsaying. Here's a demonic person employed by exploiters using her as a novelty to gain revenue. The same followed Paul in us and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us the way of salvation. And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the Spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.

And he came out the same hour.

And when her master saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul in silence and drew them into the marketplace, unto the rulers, and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. And the multitude rose up together against them. The magistrates rent off their clothes, commanded to beat them. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. Whoever received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks. Well, so much for seeing the vision of a Macedonian come help us. This is the reward, Lord, for obeying the heavenly vision, publicly being disrobed, which is a shameful thing, and being beat to a pulp and laid many stripes upon them.

You guys need to hear the crack of those whips.

You need to know that they have seven or eight or ten, twelve things coming out at the end, each one bound with pieces of glass, sharp rock, bone, the things that cut into the flesh to the bone.

You're more dead than alive when you're finished with this lashing. This isn't a little reproof. This is a death sentence.

All the more if you're going to be cast into a lower dungeon and bound in your feet and unable to move and change your position in the stink of urine and feces and the lack of hygiene and those filthy prisons, you'll have gangrene before the night is over.

You'll be dead in days.

For a woman to deliver her, who mocked them with that haunting in maniacal, these men be the servants of the most high God, and this did she many days, but Paul being grieved, not irritated, Paul being grieved, Paul being compassionate, Paul being stirred by God at a moment of the Lord's own choosing turned and said to the Spirit, come out of her.

Why didn't he do it earlier? Why didn't Jesus upturn the money changer's tables earlier? Weren't they there long enough for him to see and know? There's a moment in God's saints that needs to be waited for. We cannot initiate our own conduct.

Merely because we see something that needs evidently to be touched or handled is not a green light to do so until the moment of God's givingness.

Because the timing is extraordinary. The set time to favor Zion has come. The set time to deliver this woman.

The set time to set in motion the consequence of your public shame and beating and imprisonment has come.

Now turn and command that spirit to come out. You don't do this by the numbers. Did the other use that phrase? You know the old painting sets?

We can paint the Lord's Supper because 15 is green and 12 is blue and that's doing it by the numbers. Hey, this is apostolic.

This is not kid stuff. This is not for amateurs.

This is for men who are sent and are obedient to the detail of God's unfolding and will that does not have to be explained to them. Here she mocked them day after day. Paul had any number of occasions in which he could have turned and cast that disturbing spirit out.

But it wasn't because he was disturbed. It wasn't because he was irritated. It wasn't because he was eventful.

It was because he was grieved for a woman being made a piece of merchandise being exploited in a demonic condition by men who obtained profit from that pathetic display and at a certain moment in God's time he acted.

And what was the consequence?

Being brought into the marketplace where the rulers are.

Now, you dear saints, we have the setting of the last days. This is where the action is.

When you touch the prophet system, when you touch the world, you watch it rise up in great anger and indignation to strip you and to beat you and to imprison you. This isn't some little minor note of a woman that happened to be a piece of traffic, but they touched something by which her masters had made great gain. When the church would get off of its haunches and challenge the world and confront its prophet system and its mentality and its ideologies and its lies and show what is under the surface of the whole system of pretense that makes of an entire generation merchandise, we will find ourselves pulled into the marketplace and stripped and beaten and imprisoned again.

But how come it hasn't happened till now?

Because you have been inoffensive and ineffective and you've not touched the world system.

You have even endorsed it. You have even employed its style. You need to know, saints, there's a war on.

The prince of this world rules the world of merchandise and technology and the false values by which men and women and children are turned into merchandise. Kids choosing their products, they know Sony from this, from that, they know what they want. We have kids that are sophisticated beyond their time and they know what they want. Kids that are sophisticated beyond their time in merchandise and not themselves becoming merchandise. Fascinated, mesmerized, taken up by all of that electronic junk that they don't even know how to read or have any delight in reading. And we're watching it, hating and abetting it, and not understanding how deadly is the world as system.

Touch one of its victims and bring release and see what your reward will be. How vicious was this consequence?

They tore their clothes off, they lashed them. You can hear that they're coming down on the flesh of these men, cutting deep right to the bone because they dared to challenge the premises by which the world lives its lie.

This is not spiritual. We just preach the gospel. We don't touch the world. We don't deal with social issues.

Baloney, not to be concerned for what is made in God's image when it is turned to merchandise and exploited is unGodly and a contradiction of the gospel. We have every right and obligation to be concerned and involved in the issues of life and society in the world and the nation in which we dwell. It's not a contradiction of the gospel, it's the very outworking. It's a lie that it's unspiritual to be concerned for social things and that we're only concerned for the gospel, for salvation. That touch the world that be involved with its issues is worldly, maybe the deepest spirituality. These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city. It's not because they were Jews, it's because they were apostles, had the power to deliver the victim, teaching customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe being Romans. It's interesting to see the justification, the way in which the world excuses and justifies itself in terms of customs, tradition and law when the whole essence of its nature is lawlessness and rebellion against God and they're opposing the servants of God on the basis that their customs are being contradicted. It's hypocrisy, it's a lie.

It needs to be blown to the whistle and you'll only be able to blow it to the degree that you can identify it.

You'll only be able to identify it to the degree that you yourself are not subject to that system, not influenced by its merchandise, not seduced and taken up by its impressiveness. You see it for the evil that it is intrinsically and you oppose it. You want to set the captives free who are bound by it, which is to say virtually all your nation. So when they had laid many stripes, how judicious the Lord is. He doesn't tell us how many, but usually it was 39. Somehow they stopped before 40, but 39 is enough to kill anyone.

The victims are more dead than alive. They're cut right to the bone. They're exposed.

They're bleeding and thrown into an inner dungeon, made their feet fast in the stocks.

What an unhappy conclusion.

Paul must have missed it right from the beginning.

They never should have left Asia. They were successful there. And now where are they in some remote part of the world where they have never before been?

They have no cell phone, no way to call back home and say, pray for us.

This is what's happening. They're alone. They're isolated.

They're suffering and they're ready to receive gangrene and death in some remote, stinking, filthy, dung-filled prison.

That's God. That's obedience to the Holy Spirit and the vision that comes in the night. You can keep it, Lord, if that's going to be the consequence.

But at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God. This has got to be one of the most precious verses in the whole holy writ.

At midnight, the darkest hour, what do you think Satan is doing with these men who are sitting bound?

They can't even change their position and their bleeding and pus and infection and smelling the stink and hearing the moaning of these prisoners in a hopeless, insoluble situation in which they can't even contact colleagues for prayer. Helpless final end of a brilliant apostolic career that if only they had not gone, they could have been safe, could have been successful.

And what do you think the enemy is saying? You really missed it. You should have stayed where you were. You didn't really get a vision from God.

That was your imagination and look what it has got you and now you are finished in your apostolic career and it serves you right.

Have you ever heard that voice? Have you ever heard that voice? To mock you? You know that when he's mocking you, you're probably in the right place.

Because worse than the beating, worse than the lashing, worse than the physical pain is the intimidation, the threat, the discouragement that comes from, you really missed it.

You know why? Because you can really consider that maybe I have. Want to know why I'm standing before you and you're not standing before me?

Because I have been faced with crisis, conditions like that many times over these 42 years and in obedience to the Lord that was insane. It contradicted every category and didn't show any immediate fruit. And I had to believe in my obedience that this was God and seemed to have missed it. And there is not an immediate vindication where the Lord says, that's okay my son, you obeyed me.

You don't have to wait for the visible evidence. Be comforted in your heart. He says nothing. You know God like that?

Willing to speak on eunuch for Christ's sake in a full gospel regional conference? He says, in a full gospel regional conference before 5,000 people and offend everybody?

Eunuch for Christ's sake? And people lining up to see you after that meeting?

Grandparents and parents who wanted grandchildren and are enraged with you as if you have encouraged their children to be abstinent and not have children.

They should be eunuchs. That wasn't your thought at all. You were speaking spiritually.

Because Jesus said there are eunuchs that are born eunuchs.

They're deformed. They can't procreate.

There are eunuchs that are compelled to be eunuchs by men. But there are those who have made themselves eunuchs for Christ's sake.

They've laid the axe to the root.

They've cut themselves off from gratification and the kinds of things that we all take for granted as being our right in order to serve God in an absoluteness that is rare for the last days.

That was the message. Misunderstood?

Inga wept through the whole thing.

Misunderstanding it.

And compelling me to live as a eunuch ever since for the last 20 or 30 years.

How do you like them apples? You pay for your message.

And a guy came up to me.

He said, I'm Jewish. I'm a prophet.

I'm sent of God to tell you that you have missed the mind of the Lord and done incalculable damage to the body of Christ.

And you need to go right back up onto the platform and recant your message. But I've been fasting. I've been fasting for days for this one word.

The Lord gave me this word.

I think he did. Did I miss it? He could be right.

It's like a knife in your heart and it's turned to the hilt.

Listen, you want to be prophetic? This is pain, saints. This is suffering. This is anguish of soul.

Because it may well be right that indeed you have missed God.

And you have to suffer and weigh that on every occasion of obedience.

That no matter what history you have and how much God has vindicated your faithfulness, there may be an instance now in which he's being missed.

Because that possibility always exists that is before you. You live in a terrible anguish of prophetic tension. What do you think? This was a cheapie? This costs.

Paul was anguished, especially when your body is afflicted.

When you're weak and broken and hurt, the suggestions of the enemy are all the more seductive and all the more persuasive.

You really missed the Lord and look what it has got you. That man who was the Jew, the prophet, I didn't go up and recant. But for weeks and months afterwards he would send me telegrams. We had moved to Denmark, Inga's country, and I was up in a little loft above our apartment with my tail between my legs like a dog licking his wounds. Of course I was getting these harassing telegrams.

You need to repent. You need to write to the full gospel businessmen. They need to publish in their organ that you were mistaken. And I'm thinking here he may be right.

But one day reading a Chinese man by the name of Watchman Lee, I believe in his three volumes, The Spiritual Man, he used exactly the same verses that I had cited that night in that message. And he said, if the hearers miss this word and do not receive it spiritually, it could be the greatest offense and misconstruction. And when I read that, the burden was lifted months after bearing it as an anguished night and day.

Are you willing to have a baptism, to be a preacher of the prophetic word like that?

And I can multiply the instances that I'm describing to you, where there's a tension of possibility that indeed however well-meaning your intention, however sincerely you have fasted and sought the Lord in prayer, there's no assurance that you on this instance did not in fact miss God.

Your past history of obedience is no assurance or guarantee of anything.

We have to live with that prospect and that tension and not think that we're going to enjoy a vindication in the moment of our obedience, which we crave.

Why is God so silent at such crisis moments?

Why does he let us languish like that and lick my wounds like a dog in some loft over the apartment in Denmark and wrestle over the possibility that this man might be right?

Why didn't he say, take it easy, you followed me, not a word, silence.

This is the school of the prophet saints. You're welcome to enroll, but at midnight, the darkest hour at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard them.

I'll tell you what, I'm naive enough to believe every single prisoner who heard them, I'll meet them in eternity.

When they can hear men praising God in the midst of their affliction, they're hearing the most profound testimony of a living God, all the more compounded because it issues out of suffering.

To be able to praise God at midnight is no small thing. This is not charismatic fun and games.

This is a man who knows and knows that he knows it's a privilege to suffer the reproaches of the Lord.

It's a privilege to be in the school of his obedience.

It's a privilege to suffer whatever consequence we might, if it furthers the purposes of God. Even if we die as the result of it, there's an eternal reward and all we can do is rejoice even in the midst of our suffering. When you can praise God in your suffering, the church has arrived. It's not the suffering that comes from our stupidity or our sin, it's the suffering that has come through our obedience to the heavenly vision. Suddenly there was a great earthquake. Oh, what a coincidence of all the happy occasions with geophysical disturbance. Or was it that where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. The spirit is nowhere more present than when he's given opportunity to be expressed from the lips of a saint in the midst of his suffering as praise. There was a sudden earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty and the spirit of the Lord is profoundly in the place of praise when it issues out of ultimate suffering and anguish of soul. Because Paul was not a prisoner of circumstance, because bars do not a prison make, because to be free in Christ is to be free indeed even when you're manacled and chained.

Is that true? You know that freedom?

Bars do not a prison make. To be free in Christ is to be free indeed in the midst of seeming confinement. So I've seen the greatest evidence of apostolic reality and stature in the places of confinement. East Germany during the communist regime, I met these men who labor for the Lord under unbelieving Lutheran superintendents who themselves are under the authority of communist officials who are atheists. We Americans were not put up for that for a moment. We would not labor under such restriction and confinement, we would go start our own church. But you don't start your own church in East Germany under communist rule when the wall is up. And yet submitting to that confinement and narrowness, I saw such a depth of apostolic character and stature that somehow to serve God in the place of restriction brings forth a quality of his life than if we had ample freedom and leisure to do our thing being American or Malaysian. There's something about restriction when it's born that somehow has the genius for enlargement more so than seeming freedom itself.

So are you chafed by some restriction?

Your marriage or some circumstance or bodily limitation or age or whatsoever, kiss your manacles, kiss your chains, be blessed by the restriction and let God work out a depth of apostolic character and Godliness in the place of confinement that is more available than if you had expansive freedom in which there would be no issue. And believe that the chains and the restrictions are not arbitrary or accidental but divinely given. They loved the sovereignty of God even if it meant their imprisonment and therefore they could rejoice in it and in the rejoicing there was a great earthquake and everyone's bands were loose. The keeper of the prison in verse 27, awaking out of his sleep, seeing the prison doors open, he drew out a sword, would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had fled but Paul cried out in a loud voice saying, do thyself no harm we're all here.

Why would he kill himself?

Well he's going to lose his retirement, he's going to lose his whatchamacallit, his near retirement. His security is gone now because he failed in his trust. These men must flee if the doors are open.

You think they're going to remain?

He's finished in his career and if his career is over and his security is over, he's a dead man, he might as well end it. What a statement of the world, its mentality.

But Paul said, do yourself no harm, we're still here.

Paul is in the dungeon, the man is outside the prison.

How did Paul know that he was threatening to take his life?

He must have seen it by the eye of the spirit and he cried out sufficiently to save the man from killing himself and denying the salvation that was soon to come to him and to his house.

Do yourself no harm, we're still here. We're not going anywhere.

We're no more imprisoned with the with the feathers off of us than we were when they were on because feathers and bars don't make up a prison. We're not confined, we're free in Christ with or without feathers or buns. We're still here and we'll be here until God tells us to move. The issue is not what men have imposed but what God has required and we're free and to be in the will of God even in a dungeon.

Listen, saints, let that come back to your memory in some future time when you'll be in a dungeon.

You're not always going to enjoy the placid conditions that now prevail in an essentially Islamic nation. The issues are going to become fierce in a future time and we would be well within reason to contemplate that there's hardship, suffering, arrest, confinement, persecution ahead for the believers, for the church and the land. There will be times we will be in prison, we'll be suffering some of these same circumstances. May we remember the example of Paul before us and worship God at midnight. Knowing that it's not man, it's not circumstance, something is being served that will set prison keepers free and prisoners who hear our praise will be transported out from death and hell and into eternity because God has brought us to a place where except that we had been there to sound his praises they would have perished in their unbelief. The purposes of God are past finding out even the persecutions of the church, especially the persecutions, serve his ultimate and last days purposes if we can receive it with grace and rejoicing that we have defeated the powers of the air.

Remember that early message?

What is the wisdom for which God has created all things in order that the church might demonstrate to the principalities and powers of the air the manifold wisdom of God. The manifold wisdom of God that destroys the powers and leaves them helpless, hanging on the ropes and finished is to be able to rejoice in suffering and count it privilege that martyrdom is no some grim final verdict for a few martyrdom is the privilege of all the church. In fact when I first preached after a 14 month silence where God forbade me any speaking at all publicly and I was invited to speak on the misc on Israel and the church in a phone call that came from California, you don't know me brother Katz I'm pastor so and so we have been praying here and believe that God wants you to speak to us a seminar on Israel and the church in the last days the very phrase that had come up in my own heart after my first semester at a Lutheran seminary when God had dissolved our community I had not spoken for 14 months and the Lord didn't tell me why can you be silent when you're a mouthpiece and you live from your mouth and God forbids you to speak publicly and doesn't explain why and 14 is two times seven and seven is the number of completion that somehow the message that was to come was so holy so on time so requiring this kind of preliminary of silence which is a death that I had to submit to it without explanation and came to California 10 days in advance for prayer and fasting and began that night with people with them their tape recorders to catch every jewel and began the first night by saying that I'll call this to move Israel to jealousy and I didn't explain how or why and went on through six messages each one was a thunderclap that the pastor when I finished said these were historic days indeed they were I went to bed the last Saturday night Sunday morning was the seventh and final message and I didn't know what it was you go to bed like that without knowing that within hours you're going to be up and on the spot and complete an entire seminar with the capstone message that will bring everything together and you don't know what that message is this instance true service is a suffering of a moral kind of a spiritual kind that eclipses physical suffering I'd much rather take sickness or wounds than suffer the anxiety and and the anguish of what's to be spoken and if I speak it is it the mind of the Lord what if I miss it can I be in error yes there's a tension in this faith and the definition of what a saint is is one who willingly lives with that tension when we have our Christianity down pat and we know it all and have it all programmed and and conveniently laid out we're out of the faith we're in the faith when we suffer its tensions so three o'clock in the morning not 259 or 301 3 a.m. exactly boom I shot out of bed like a rocket the Lord awakened me with one word martyrdom the message that final Sunday morning the seventh message the church that will move Jews to jealousy is a martyr church whatever martyrdom means that is its character and what it means is not what you bravely bear in a final moment by sucking air and taking a deep breath martyrdom is not a way of dying it's a way of living it's a mode of living in which your life is not your own that it doesn't matter what the final moment is or how it comes in in what form however it comes it's a privilege and the crown we need to anticipate martyrdom as privilege because to count martyrdom privilege is to defeat the powers of the air they think that your whole purpose is to maintain your bodily life what else is it about take care of number one what you're willing to be a victim for Jews you silly sap what did they ever do for you but your willingness to suffer that for another is the very enactment of the nature of God and his wisdom and it defeats the powers because what can they do to you are they going to terrify or they're going to intimidate you or they threaten you when your life is not your own and you've given it up long before what can they do they're finished great mystery is completed in our willingness to receive the call of martyrdom not just for the final moment but for all our moments because the final moment is the sum of all the moments that have preceded it are you living like that moment by moment with that kind of consciousness and understanding that your life is not your own then the Lord can use you to speak about eunuch for Christ's sake and other messages and other obedient says that offend deeply you cannot answer or explain and in which you might well be wrong but you're willing to bear the tension of even being wrong rather than you should suffer the consequence of not being obedient at all this is the apostolic faith saints laid out for us in precious detail and so verse 29 he called for light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas the prison keeper with his authority is bowing before these abject prisoners who are more dead than alive and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved they said believe in the Lord Jesus Christ thou shall be saved in thy house they spoke with him the word of the Lord to all there in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straight away just like Lydia he heard the word baptized he and his whole house straight away where do we see obedience like that to a word of God for a man who is going to pay the price of reproach being baptized as Lydia herself and yet does not hesitate she's seen the demonstration of so awesome a kind of the reality of God by men who were more dead than alive that he could not resist or refuse their message unto salvation this is the church when Paul and Silas leave this is the church Lydia the woman saved out of the demonic demean the maniacal curse the prison keeper in his family these households this is the church at Philippi this motley crew of collection of off scouring of whom the world is not worthy the refuse the off the dung heap constitutes this young assembly birthed by the suffering of Paul and Silas in their obedience so that later on they can write the letter to the Philippians that has inspired generations of believers to this day this is how the church was born out of their suffering out of their obedience out of those whom the Lord called of whom the world was not worthy whole households baptized he and all his straight away and when he brought them out of the house he said meet before them and rejoiced with all his house and then the magistrates sent the sergeants let these men go the keeper of prison said to Paul they have sent to let you go now therefore deport and go in peace Paul said not so quick they have beaten us openly on condemning Romans and have cast us into prisons and now they thrust us out privately no let them come and fetch us out and the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were Romans and they came and sought them and brought them out and desired them to depart the city I don't understand why Paul was requiring this but I'm appreciating it because he's not a piece of merchandise to be dispatched because he's inconvenient to men who have gone too far in beating him he's letting them know that there's a consequence for them in their own civil disobedience and their own protection of their social and business rights that they've gone too far and you're not going to expel us as quickly as you have beaten us we'll go when the Lord says go not when you have us to depart we're not ordered by men and by circumstance or by society we march to a higher beat the Lord himself and so they went out of the prison and entered in the last verse to the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed a beautiful conclusion the brethren should have comforted them but they coming with their backs still in stripes still in suffering and comforted the believers that remain what a father's heart what a love for the church that is newly birthed through their labor and through their sacrifice and so they comforted them and they departed an episode in the life of apostle full of instruction of being led by the spirit in ways that are uncanny and contradict our religious expectation and yet require intuition that will not miss it and then when it backfires into a violence and finding yourself in a prison instead of being discouraged by the enemy and saying you missed it you rejoice at midnight this is this is is there a word for this this is another dimension this is another realm of reality and it's the definitive realm of reality to which we are called we have and of which we have fallen short can we be summoned to such obedience as this outside our own categories to be led out of the city to the riverside when the city would have promised a greater numerical response how we cannot go by our fixed categories and principles that are religious and need to be so eminently led by the spirit and if we are what is the final upshot conflict with the world touching it at its heart and at its system watching the mask of civility come off and then beating us to a pulp and casting us into a prison not just to be interred but to die and gangrene and agony and and unattended wounds because you've touched a system of which the devil is the guardian and the source there's a there's a war on there's a conflict that that world is the world today and it has not been challenged by the church nor have its victims been delivered because we don't even see them as victim because we are so much influenced and have an attitude toward the world that is benign rather than antagonistic we don't see it as being at enmity with God and turning our children into merchandise they're losing their personalities their identity they're just consumers to perpetrate a system and if we will endorse the world in its system how long will it be before our church becomes such and the issue of consumers and putting before them what they want for a sunday service and making nice and making sure that there's an offering so that the world instead of being challenged by the church becomes adopted by the church and transfigures and corrupts the church because we have not stood in opposition to the world that which is at enmity with God and seen it as intrinsically evil and opposed it in the power of God to set its victims free whatever the consequence to ourselves we're a self-contained little entity of a religious kind that constitutes no threat to the world and the greatest mock that ought to shame us are the powers of darkness that prevail over malaysia and say Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you who constitute no threat go on with your fun and games go on with your conferences go on with your activity constitutes nothing for us because our vested interest are not imperiled by anything that you represent say or do to know this that the final lesson is to be that church is to suffer but the suffering becomes a witness that sets captives free who would otherwise have taken their own lives sets prisoners free who hear your praise and can't fathom how you can praise God with your back hanging in stripes of flesh and that you counted a privilege to suffer that in obedience to the lord has got to be a testimony that saves as nothing else will so lord we want to pray for such a church my God is this just a piece of antiquity is this a little piece of history for our amusement or is this a definitive statement of the church of every age and every time and especially at the end because if that's a standard of any kind we don't even begin to approach it and we're asking my God that that we will that you'll prepare us and fit us for apostolic obedience that will lay aside our categories our presumptions that are religious that will hear your still small voice will receive your vision bring us my God to that sensitivity and union with yourself that proximity to your heart that the faintest disposition registers upon us come my God transact with men and women tonight settle something in heaven lord there needs to be a great measure of the cross of death to self to opinion to independence if we are to come into the configuration by which we can be sent into this hostile world let there be a people willing for that suffering in the church and in their service that will affect malaysia affect the nations affect Israel establish your glory in Jesus name we pray
