Israels Predicament - Art Katz

and were unsparing in bringing the proclamation of God's necessary judgment, also became the prophets of restoration.

If we refuse the one, we will not be the candidate for the other.

This is not just an idle matter of historic curiosity, but a profound principle of God, because the church itself is called to be prophetic, and to interpret even for their nations the meaning of its own history, and speak of those things that are future. And not to retract from hard things, because if you retract there, you will not be able to speak the message of comfort. It's Isaiah that speaks, comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, but only after they have received double for their sins, then is their warfare over. Don't comfort them prematurely, don't abort the necessary chastisement and dealings of God, for when they will have fulfilled their purpose, then shall the nation be comforted. Yes, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, when mourning and sighing will have fled away.

First mourning and sighing.

Then everlasting joy upon their heads. It's God's dealing with Israel that instructs us about God. It's the failure to recognize how far God will go with his own nation, that has given us a soft and sentimental view about ourselves.

So Paul speaks about the severity and the goodness of God. So Paul speaks about the severity and the goodness of God. We want to major in the goodness. Paul speaks also about the severity.

For what is the mercy of God, except in the context of judgment? To remove judgment from mercy is to remove mercy.

So we have to eat the entire lamb of God.

That was the first requirement in the first Passover.

Eat the lamb, leave nothing behind. Don't pick and choose that which you like. We need the whole lamb.

The judgments of God as well as his mercies. For if you could understand, his judgments are his mercies.

We need to welcome them. Even for ourselves, as well as for Israel. The world will learn righteousness and not in any other way.

Jesus himself was the object of God's judgment. Christ crucified as the statement of God's judgment against sin. Could we have been instructed without that visible judgment that he was willing himself to bear it is the very nature of God who doesn't dissolve the judgments, but fulfills them even in himself.

Who were disappointed at his crucifixion.

So after his resurrection appearance with the two on the road to Emmaus, whose faces had fallen, they were disappointed and dejected.

Their human and religious hopes had been disappointed.

Their souls and slow of heart not to believe all that the prophets have written.

You selected the good parts, but you left out the hard parts.

Ought not the Messiah to suffer and die before he ascends to his glory?

That is intrinsic to all reality. That is unavoidable. The issue is not success, the issue is glory. And if there's to be a glory, there's to be a suffering. And he can say this to our generation.

That Israel is going to attain to its glory without first suffering. So also must they, for their suffering is proportionate to their glory. They have an ultimate destiny before all nations to be fulfilled from this brokenness.

Are we doing okay up there in the technical department?

So Lord, precious God, instruct our understanding.

We are soft, sentimental, and human, all too human.

All that the prophets have spoken.

We have made the cross a decoration around our necks and in the architecture of our churches. But we also shrink from it. We have no stomach for its pain. And so we have also taken away the glory for which we will be eternally ashamed. Thank you that the history of Israel is for us.

These things are written for us, for whom the ends of the age have come. To the whole counsel of God, to God as judge, righteous judge, with joy, not with reluctance. I guess I have to love His judgment, as we love His mercies. He is the projection of our own humanity and therefore a false God, a false religion, a false church, without any ability to be a witness in the world or to be a saving instrument for Israel. I give you praise in Jesus' name.

Amen.

Well, if we had all kinds of time and could go verse by verse, the text is so full of these things. But in chapter five, after the description of the hard, difficult things about Israel and about Israel, where He stretched out His hand in verse 25, and struck them, and the mountains quaked, and the corpses were like refuse, heaped up in the streets. But for all that, His anger has not turned away as the commentary says at the bottom of the page. The past judgments did not lead to repentance.

So God's anger is still unabated. Nothing has changed. His hand is stretched out still. Except out of a broken and contrite spirit. Not in its present arrogance.

Who do not see the unbroken dealings of God that have not yet obtained what He is after.

So we can rightly expect that these judgments will be ended.

But you say, brother, what about the Nazi holocaust? Your book contends that that was a judgment. A fulfillment of God's word.

Of what would befall Israel in the last days. Have we acknowledged that we have received double for our sins? Have we acknowledged our sins? Or the sins of our fathers or our own? The statement that we have come with at the end of the holocaust is not that we repent, never again. What does that imply?

That this was not a judgment coming from the hand of God.

This is an aberration in history. If Hitler had not lived, we might not have experienced it. If the number one military power in the Middle East the great Air Force nuclear deterrent never again. As if we ourselves can affect our own destiny.

So long as that is our mentality how shall we bless all the families of the earth? So what hinders us from agreeing with the prophets?

I think the key is in what happened in Isaiah's experience himself.

He was given a vision of the king high and lifted up. I wish I could articulate what is in my spirit. I have been touching on this in the previous sessions, but not sufficiently. It's our failure to share with Isaiah his vision of the king that makes us to shrink from his prophetic judgments. Once you glimpse the king and his glory and his throne then you understand, then it follows that in order to achieve that in the earth judgments must come. Because your vantage point is the issue of the king his enthronement, his rule of the creation.

And that brings everything into the correct perspective.

Including Israel and God's purposes through her herself, the purpose of our own salvation. Everything comes into focus when we see the king and the kingdom.

But what did it take for him to see that?

In verse one, in the year that king Isaiah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up.

So what do you think? Is that coincidence? Circumstance? A way of bringing a chronological date?

Or is there a connection between the death of the king and the revelation of the king?

And we are confused because we don't understand the scriptures. We have read them too casually. We have glossed over these significant Holy Ghost details. And here is what I suggest.

The death of king Isaiah was the key to the revelation of the king who is king.

We need to identify who our Isaiah is. And that must be brought to a death. Or we will never agree with God. We will never be ready for the sacrifice, either for Israel or for ourselves if we do not see the king. And if we do not see that, then we only have a small, small kingdom. My ministry, my church, my denomination, my nation. Something had to die for him. Something has to die for us. And I'm not saying that that is a necessarily sinful thing. It may well be an honorable thing. It's not that it's necessarily sinful.

But it has taken a proportion beyond God's intention and has obscured your seeing and filled your contemplation over the lesser things by which you list the greater.

And this afternoon a brother came to me.

He asked me, why should we pray for your kingdom to come on earth?

Won't it come by itself? Does it require our prayer?

You do err, brother, because you know not the Scriptures nor the power of God.

What do you think the kingdom of God is? Some cheap phrase, a little invocation, a little formula? It's ultimate. It's the issue of God's glory.

It's His governance over His own creation in righteousness and in equity by which nations will study war no more. If you only knew what nations are spending for armaments, the smallest of them, who can least afford it, whose people live at the threshold of starvation, who never see a dentist in their lifetime, they have to have F-16 fighter bombs.

Because the Lord allowed me to visit the plant where they're manufactured. I'll never forget the experience. The price tag is unimaginable.

Beyond millions, these technical, these pieces of supreme technology, instruments of death, and I saw the names of the nations painted on these planes ready to go.

Thailand, Indonesia, the most insignificant of nations has to have this piece of equipment. Because the neighbor has one. An issue of prestige, power, authority, threat, intimidation. We cannot know what is being expended. And Israel itself is the second or third largest nation that sells the most weapons in the world. America is number one, Russia is number two. A big, big business. But it means the nations will no longer study war.

In the ethnic pride and arrogance, the Lord will rule over them in equity and justice, from the throne of Zion, or he will not rule over them at all. And where it is about Israel and Zion, that can only be occupied by a son of David, in the city of David, in Jerusalem, in Israel, but not as she is presently constituted, but will become appropriately in view of the kingdom, as a result of the final dealings of God. I don't think that this is a view unique to me. The view that is a novelty is the one that is the Christian Zionist prevalent view. Present Israel will succeed, they will overcome them, the prophetic fulfillment. This is a novel view, shared by David Barron, Adolf Safir, the most eminent Hebrew Christian Old Testament commentators of the century, before the advent of the State of Israel. These Old Testament commentators agreed, there must be a necessary preliminary return, something that will agitate a contention against it, that will result in a friction of expulsion, a final dealing and sifting of God, and a return. And I will restore you, the book of Amos ends with, and you will not again be rooted out.

You will not again be afraid.

All that present Israel is now experiencing, has been prophesied, as will be their final historic experience, culminating in an expulsion from the land, and they will return to Zion, but they didn't leave it in that condition. Something has happened to them in their expulsion, and for fear that I will not have opportunity tomorrow to speak of it, that you need to consult Ezekiel chapter 20 from verse 33, a classic text, I will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations, and there I will contend with you, and you will come into the bund of my covenant, and under the rod of my authority, and that is how the redeemed of the Lord return to Zion.

Something happens as a result of their expulsion and sifting through the nations.

God meets with them in the wilderness of the nations, where the Jews would not go otherwise, because it would not be safer for them to go in such urban cities.

They need to be in the wilderness.

A wilderness is a stripping experience, in which you review all your categories, Los Angeles, now has lost all coherence and meaning.

You are stripped, lost, defenseless, and in flight from persecution.

And God says, in that condition I will meet with you. In flight, uprooted, moving through the nations, not from external persecution, but from an internal collapse of all my categories, the arrogant opinionated man, the vehement atheist, even my values were gone, but also my natural possessions. Moving through the nations as an auto-stopper, totally dependent on the mercy that would come to me from those who would pick me up. That is another view of reality, a truer reality than when we fly first class. That is the deception, as some of my kinsmen have only painfully learned on September 11th.

There is still a small voice, and we Jews have been filled too much with our own opinions.

That we might hear the voice of the God of our fathers and be heard. I was sharing with our pastor here earlier this evening what makes me so convinced of the truth of what I am proclaiming to the church. Though it is a painful view to consider, that just when Israel seems within reach of establishing itself as success, as indeed I was in my 34th year as a professional, as a teacher, then suddenly the bottom falls out and you are thrust out and you are thrust out into the world and into the nation. So that I am speaking not only from a view that I believe is sustained through all the prophets, but also the classical biblical commentators of previous generations, but my own experience of the last 27 years of my believing life.

For we ourselves are living in the wilderness of our nation, nothing I asked for, nothing I desired. Ironically I was living just outside of New York, in a 17-room house with five bathrooms. My wife loved this house.

And the Lord brought me supernaturally to a property where we presently are.

In the wilderness of America, ten miles from the closest town, population 200, and the headquarters of a North American Indian nation, the headquarters of a North American Indian nation.

I must ask you, and you are a Jewish believer, and you call to your own people, and New York is your own birthplace and home city, and you left that to go out into this nowhere place against the shrieks and cries of men who said you were a fool, and you've been there for 27 years, and Charisma Magazine thought you were dead, but now they've just published my statement on the recent catastrophe in New York.

They thought I was dead. They thought I had died in this accident. They knew me and wrote about me. Why?

Because as a speaker in that locality, waiting to go back to my nice home they said, Art, there's a property for sale.

Would you care to see it? Why not? Let's go for a ride. So they take me out in the car to this remote boys' camp that has now gone bankrupt and is for sale. And there's a chain over the road. No trespassing.

So I stepped over it, and when my foot came down, there were the exact words that God spoke to me. Dominion, the name that the property now has borne for many years, what does dominion mean? It means the sovereignty of God, end time teaching center, refuge.

That's all he had to say. My wife has never been persuaded. She didn't want to give up her beautiful Gothic home. It was such a still, small voice.

If I had missed it, as being only a figment of my own imagination, the Lord would have allowed it, and he would not have penalized me.

I would have gone on to be a charismatic success. It didn't mean anything to me.

The Lord spoke, I was obedient, we came, and within a short time we had a community of 55 people, Jesus freaks, that didn't have a penny to their pocket.

No one who ever came to us had anything to bring us back, only to take. And we were poor for 10 years. We lived beneath the poverty level established by the government. It was a fiery furnace of faith. And what's the purpose? From persecution. A hundred miles south of the Canadian border, where I have just visited before coming here, and found out how porous that border is. Just to cross one point of the river and one point of a lake You're in the United States of America. We are in the coldest place of the North American continent. It's been a long history of struggle and suffering. But in the more recent years, the Lord has shown us other places called in the same way. So what is beginning to surface is a linkage of such places of refuge. From Canada to Mexico. I'm finding them in Europe. God will establish them in the world.

Because in prophet Amos it says, I will save you from all nations.

Israel has made a terrible mistake. I have misspent 27 years of my life and suffered almost every struggle. Or we are a pioneer for you.

Which you yourself are called. Brother, I can understand refuge, but why community?

You lose your privacy. And there's so many difficulties with people when you live in that kind of intensity of relationship. Is that necessary? Can't we just continue our private lifestyle and still be to the Jews what we must? You cannot imagine the condition in which they will come to you.

Suddenly uprooted, having lost everything in flight for their lives, watching some of their own children or daughters or sons killed.

To America, a global hatred against the Jews.

A fulfillment of what Jesus himself spoke.

That there's a trouble coming that will exceed anything that the nation has previously known. This is that trouble. And they are unprepared.

And in this condition they will come to you.

And then you will have to extend yourself to them. What if you are caught? You will be accused of being a Jew lover.

And your willingness to take that risk will reveal to them what the church has never yet been able to communicate. That by our mercy they shall receive mercy.

We have never fulfilled what Paul has spoken. We have never moved them to jealousy.

Our last historic opportunity to fulfill the mystery of which Paul speaks. That by our mercy they will receive mercy.

You have mercy to give? It's not the concept of mercy.

It's not a doctrine of mercy to which we mentally subscribe as being true.

It's the actuality of mercy.

So tell me, dear Austrian saints, when have you needed the mercy of God last or anything? I'm speaking to you tonight from the mercy of God.

I was so empty. So lacking in inspiration.

If anything comes, Lord, it's Your mercy.

I'm bringing an unpopular view. My critics and adversaries are increasing. And the awareness of the church is so limited. In a few meetings you have to turn the world upside down for them. And communicate something that will make them patently uncomfortable. The subject of judgment. Last days calamity. Apocalyptic disaster. Jews in flight. There's no way to succeed unless I receive mercy. To communicate the very subject.

And if it takes a mercy to communicate the subject in which everything in us resists, what will it take to fulfill it? I preached this in the church that by our mercy they shall receive mercy.

She cried out of the congregation.

She said, Brother Katz, we don't even have mercy for each other.

How shall we have it for Jews? Exactly. But we would never have been aware of it. And would have lived in indifference to it.

And if it is not about Israel, and what God is requiring from us for them, then the church must first begin with us.

And that will make the church the church.

For a church that is without mercy is not the church.

But Israel and the existence of Israel is because of us. It compels us to be the church. In ways that we would never have chosen. That's why Paul finishes his statement in Romans 11 with his great praise. Oh, the depth of the riches.

Of the wisdom and knowledge of God. Who has given to him and it shall be given again. For of him and through him and to him are offerings. To whom be glory forever. You dear saints, if you are not to be another flash in the pan, another momentary phenomenon, another evangelical success, the jealousy for God's glory must become central.

You will not be willing for the suffering of becoming a community. You will not be willing to suffer to become a community. Unless you're jealous for his glory. Community is a suffering. Humiliation. You can't hide behind your Sunday face. You're with the same saints on Monday.

And they hear you when you come and tell them what a great saint you are.

The door slams behind you.

When you go to the prayer meeting, the founder of the community, the leader, anointed man of God, and they have all heard that.

Because we're living close enough that the truth cannot be concealed. We have to live in the truth, which is a humiliation before it's a glory. Or we'll have no mercy to give. It will take the corporate collective strength of a tested community to be to the Jews what we must. Not no single individual.

However much he is a spiritual virtuoso can be to them in patience and courage.

Patience or courage. What we must. They will test us. They have always tested the church. Even Luther has failed the test.

And many of the apostolic giants reacted against the Jews.

Because they're so abrasive. That we very quickly lose our spiritual calm. But that will be our test. What will it show? We can also be nice Christians under normal circumstances. But what if we are stretched?

What if it's the time of the Antichrist where you cannot buy yourself without the mark of abyss?

And you've laid up some things for your own family. Will you be willing to share? Empty your own supply?

Under the irritation and provocation is the test of the truth of your spirituality.

And I want to say 10,000 Sunday services will not obtain that.

But the daily trial to live together as a community of God's people is the very place where God shapes His divine character and establishes it in us. You move in this direction and you will see that He has created a new resistance to the forces of darkness. They have not bothered you until now.

And why should they? What threat have you constituted to them? They are formidable, authentic, apostolic giants. But who are you?

You move in this direction of apostolic and prophetic authenticity. Moving from our privatistic, evangelical situation into the increasing reality of the church as community and they will take a new interest in you. They will take note of you for now you constitute a threat to the kingdom of darkness. Well, what is the community of God but the expression of another kingdom? Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God.

He knew what we needed. He knew the privatistic mode that would settle upon us. And even our church architecture is modeled after the world.

Passive audiences looking up to the elevated platform in services provided by credentialed ministers. But this is so in contradiction to the apostolic beginning. When you come together, Paul said, each one of you has a tongue, an interpretation, a prophecy, a hymn, a revelation.

He expected that the church would feed itself.

He visualized the passivity to which we are accustomed and are willing to pay for so that we would be absolved from all responsibility to be active participants.

Israel will compel us to become the church even in their unbelief.

Will they be the provocation that we need to see whether our attitude to them is only sentimental which will go up in a moment when it's tested for them is the love of God which we don't even presently have for each other.

We've not been tested there because the unconditional love of God cannot fail. Sentimental will.

And those who today are the most excited and emotional toward Israel may be the ones who will turn most vehemently against her when she fails in their expectation and becomes a disappointment and the shame of the scandal in the world.

How then will you identify with them?

The least of these, his brethren, are they your brethren if they are his brethren but then if they are in their sin. I want to conclude by reading from this great Hebrew Christian commentator of the 19th century with whom I'm in complete agreement. He says to spurn the prophetic testimony of ultimate judgment to put it aside because you have no stomach for judgment. You much rather believe in the success of the state of Israel than that there must be a judgment that precedes a restoration.

It's likely due to a sanguine sentimentality. You're more sentimental than you are apostolic. More humanistic than you are spiritual.

And your response to the issue of judgment reveals it. It's really a shrinking from the cross and a clinging to our humanistic view that celebrates success more than the glory of God.

For the church as well as for Israel. For our marriages. What do you want your marriage to be, a success or a glory? Success is comfortable. Sexual compatibility. All of the warm benefits. It's good for us to be successful.

But what would a marriage be as a glory to God where we give him the permission to trouble it and raise issues that we would not otherwise have to experience that go beyond accidental compatibility where you want to spit your guts out.

You're so frustrated, you're so stupefied by the differences. And where did they come from? It was not like this before we were married. The Lord is after something much deeper than compatibility. And your enjoyment of each other. Marriage is a mystery.

I speak not of marriage but of the church.

Making the two one. Are we willing to suffer inconvenience?

Stupefying misunderstanding that leaves us helpless and any ability to make resolutions and everything else upon God bringing us to new depths of prayer so that in the end he could affect the reconciliation that is enduring and true and established in God through the work of the Holy Spirit and not the accident of compatibility.

One is a success, the other is a glory. Are you willing for that in your marriage? You want a happy fellowship? A Sunday message?

Or you want God to bring you dry seasons where the pastor himself is stupefied and says, Lord I have prayed, I have fasted, but where is my anointing?

The word falls to the ground. And they're disappointed and they're indicting me for my failure. Not understanding that they are being tested in their identification and their loyalty even when they're not being blessed. Then the roots go down deep because when the storms come and you're only thinly and shallowly planted your trees will topple. But if your roots have gone down, then your church will endure. It will be a glory to God. There's a suffering that precedes the glory. It's unavoidable. It's intrinsic to reality itself.

The Lord himself was not exempt from it even ourselves.

So I want to pray for such a church in Innsbruck, Austria.

The Lord must have such an intention or I would not be here. And how these meetings have been from well-meaning men thinking that I was going to encourage anti-Semitism and speak of catastrophes that must come to prepare a people for his kingdom.

So I know you have a destiny. It goes back into the early 1980s when your pastor heard me in South Africa. He remembered me all those years later.

And whatever is said about this controversial man he had enough respect and remembrance to allow me to share, despite the critics.

You have a destiny and I want to pray for it.

Thank you, Lord.

Are you willing for this calling or do you prefer just to be ordinary Christians?

You'll be eternally embarrassed for when he comes he brings his rewards with him to give to every person according to their works. So Lord, I bless these people. And that's what we have asked of you We don't care how many, we're not looking at numbers but bring every appointed soul as prepared for this word and for this call establish something that will have consequences and you have done it. So Lord, I bless them. That it would not fall to the ground or return to you void, but it will be fulfilled. Give this precious people a renewed vision of the cross the centrality of suffering before the glory that will enable them to endure whatever comes. I bless them. Hear from them even now. You hear from them anyone who would dare even speak to you from their seat and transact something before we conclude this service. Let you wait to hear from them their willingness to serve you by being to your people Israel what they must and are willing for every preparation that they should not fall short of that day.

Yes, even if necessary, the troubling of their marriages troubling of their fellowships.

Whatever troubling that will bring the impartation of your character your patience, your courage, your unconditional love we give over our sentimentality we give over our humanistic notion establish us in the abiding reality that we will not fail whatever it takes. Can you pray that out loud before the Lord, before witnesses whatever it takes, I am willing. Just to say that much, whatever it takes I am willing from this night enroll me fit me for this purpose and let me be part of that kind of fellowship bring me from sentimentality to the divine love I am willing for the death of disappointment and humiliation but I want to be faithful in that day so begin with me now for that day is not too distant and when it comes, it will come suddenly but may it not find me unprepared. Take me at my word tonight, I invite you to bring whatever is needful to fit me for that day in Jesus name.

Is that your prayer? Pray it.

Whatever it takes Lord as with the powers of the air and they will not just pass by you you will be regarded with a new respect even with fear, for you have crossed a Jordan into the land of promise.

You speak.
