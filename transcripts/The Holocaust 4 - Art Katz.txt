The Holocaust 4 - Art Katz

In which we will meet, the anointing of the Lord is upon us." And then he closed the book and sat down, but he never finished the scriptures.

What part did he leave out?

And the day of the vengeance of our God. That will be for us something that was not for him. It was not then to be stated, but it will be stated by us. We're going to announce the day of the vengeance of our Lord. The solution of ancient days took a liturgic form, and he quotes, For thy sake are we slain all the day.

Isn't it interesting?

That the prevalent mode of explanation, historically for Jewish calamity, is that for his sake we are slain all the day. In a certain sense it's true, but in a certain sense we're being slain for our own sin at the same time. But he says that however that had interpreted national disaster in the past, such doctrine now is an eloquent archaism at best.

You know what it means to be archaic? Old-fashioned.

It's obsolete and no longer has a present validity. You can say that we were slain, but you can't say that about the Holocaust.

It doesn't make that sense.

It has no sensible reflection in reasonable theology.

See what this guy's doing.

He's examining every kind of thing by which we were able to understand previous predicament and calamity. But he's saying that this Tremendum has introduced a new data that eclipses all past experience. Its devastation defies explanation, and therefore we cannot employ past explanation.

But whatever explanation is there?

The Tremendum is more than historical. It is an elaboration of the most terrible of Jewish fears that the eternal people is not eternal, that the chosen people is rejected, that the Jewish people is mortal. If there is one incontestable article of the Jewish consciousness, it has been the mythos of indestructibility and the moral obligation of tenacity. You know, this is so well written that it's hard to understand.

This man is so deft. He has such a facility. He uses words like a razor. Every one, I mean, it's lean. There's no flab in this.

And if you're not attuned to writing of that kind, you can miss it. So he's citing yet another factor to explain the devastation of the Holocaust, that what it has done is to do in something that Jews have all along thought about themselves as an eternal people, an indestructible people. Look how we have survived. Where is Nebuchadnezzar today?

And where are the enemies? Where are the people who had formerly afflicted us?

They're gone, historically.

There's nothing to be seen but the ruins. But we continue.

Now, when the Holocaust came and we came close to not continuing, and six million of the best of us were radically wiped out, that introduced a new consideration that had never been part before of our historic thought. You know, it's a wonderful confidence to think that you're indestructible, that you will always be. That's what makes an earthquake so remarkably traumatic, because you have believed and had a confidence in the security of the earth, that you are on terra firma. But when terra firma begins to sway and weave like a snake, and your high towers and skyscrapers begin to bend and groan and collapse, there is a fear that comes with that that cannot be described. The thing in which you had some kind of foundational confidence, some framework for reality and life, when that's taken from you, where are you and who are you and what are you?

That's what he's saying about this.

That the eternal people is not eternal.

Are we rejected? We're mortal.

If there was one incontestable article of the Jewish consciousness, it has been the mythos of indestructibility, a myth. But it's a myth that was believed. And the moral obligation of tenacity to hang in there, no matter what comes to hang in there, the Holocaust is surely ours. Against this background we can verify no other event of comparable magnitude. There is no doubt that for classic Judaism it was a shattering and defining event that marked off a Judaism of the beforehand and the after, determined the end of a cult of silent acts, and the beginning of synagogue of prayer and study.

Here's what he's saying now.

He's comparing previous calamities that have come to Judaism by which Judaism still came out smelling like a rose. How many of you know that present-day rabbinical Judaism came out of the destruction of the Temple of 70 AD? What God intended as a tremendous was turned by our artful men into a new program of reconstruction of Jewish life on another model other than what was biblical.

Why, what had happened to the possibility of continuing biblical? You couldn't, why? No sacrifice. No temple, no altar, no priesthood. Dispersion.

You would think that that would have been a trauma, that that would have been a tremendous.

But what is he saying?

That tenacity pulled us out of it and gave us an occasion to elaborate a new kind of Judaism, which has today become normative, so that Jews today think that that kind of Judaism had always prevailed. Today's Judaism has little or no correspondence to the biblical faith of the sons of Abraham. They sparked their own fire.

Right.

In the darkness, they made sparks of their own fire.

And what's the rest of that verse?

Walk in the light of it. And they shall lie down in torment. Boy, thank you for that, Ann.

Mamma Mia. That's right.

Instead of allowing the darkness to bring a revelation of God who would have met them in that darkness and in that adversity. Think of the implications for ourselves and our own lives. How quick we are to strike a spark. And where God is wanting to meet us in a deep calling unto deep, we avoid that confrontation that would have been life-transforming and come out of it by striking our own sparks and making some new adjustment to our situation that enables us to go on unscathed. And that is what rabbinical Judaism is. It was the beginning of a synagogue of prayer and study. By the insistence of the rabbis, as the eternal life of Torah planted in their midst, neutralized caesura.

Here's the way he spells it. C-A-E-S-U-R-A.

That the incisive act of God calculated to bring us to a repentance and return based on the fulfillment of the prophecy made by the Christ who was to be crucified that not one stone will be left on the other. They say that the blood, the slaughter in Jerusalem on that day of battle was so great that it was up to the bridles of the horses. Hundreds of thousands, over a million, may have been killed in Jerusalem alone. The Romans, when they got their final, God bless them, vengeance took it in full. You need to read Josephus and the final days of the destruction of Jerusalem. It is an awesome commentary of loss of life, of tragic disappointment, because they still believe that God was going to come at that final moment.

Talk about false hope and piety.

Talk about a hope that is not predicated on biblical understanding.

Talk about a failure to recognize previous judgments.

That a people who were so wanting in their spiritual condition as not only to not recognize the Messiah, but to slay him, still hoped that God was going to intervene against the Romans, not recognizing in the Romans his judgment. And when that judgment came, it was fearful. Next to the Holocaust, there is no other greater calamity in the history of Jews than the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion into the nations throughout the whole Roman Empire.

How did we Jews come into Germany? At that time.

There has been a continuous existence of Jews in the Rhineland and in Germany for 2,000 years since the expulsion that came from the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and the final defeat that came about 135 AD with the Masada suicide.

Anyone who has gone to Israel, how many people here have gone to Israel? Raise your hand. Did you visit Masada?

And did you hear the talk given by your guide?

And how Masada is described? Do you know that the, what do they call the Israeli shock troops, the commando type troops? No, that's like the secret service. They are sworn in at Masada.

There was a ceremony of dedication for the finest of Israel's fighting men on the same ground where the last of the defenders of Israel perished before the Roman defeat by committing suicide. That when the Romans finally broke through the battlements of Masada, they found every single man, woman, and child slain at their own hand. Can you imagine fathers killing their own children, killing their wives, and slashing their own throats? The only ones who survived were one or two, a woman and a child who hid themselves and were able to give the account because they could not countenance being taken by Romans. You imagine what would have been their fate. Rabbi Akiva, who sponsored the false messiah, what's his name? Bar Kokhba, the Bar Kokhba Revolt, whose name means the Star of Israel, and was touted to be the messiah.

Can you imagine this?

That the leading rabbi celebrates a man who has no biblical qualification but was a military leader as being the one who was the messiah. And of course it ended in the most tragic defeat as I'm describing, and he himself had his flesh, his skin flayed from his body in the most cruel and exquisite torture that the Romans knew well how to perform. Remember that crucifixion was a Roman invention, and Jews were not wanting their women to fall into their hands, nor themselves. So the last melancholy statement of Jewish attempt at rebellion and breaking the power of Rome, which was the judgment of God that needed to come in final fullness, was the suicide at their own hand. But when you go to that place now, 2,000 years later, it is celebrated as the place of heroism.

The troops are sworn in in that place under the title Never Again. What shall we do? Shall we laugh or shall we cry? I mean, shall we fall under these tables? Shall we cry out to God, Lord, what? What does it take, my God?

And I was leading one of our Ben-Israel kill groups through the Yad Vashem Holocaust exhibit and pointing out certain things in the context of judgment, and don't you think that somebody overheard me and called up the Ministry of Interior and Tourism and reported me for my anti-Semitic statements? You know, many of the defenders literally thought that the Romans were called the Christians, were God and made up, and you literally would, as a post-demolation movement, as nothing yet came, but two of their Gods come and say, we're living at final remit with the whole God. So there was a very hope in their prophets that they'd come and come.

They didn't recognize that they were they wouldn't pay for it. The instrument they're doing was this mystery. They were thinking about their ages, and they despised it, and it was a scandal to them.

So they left them with a hope of Israel, but out of context. I'll bet you a dollar to doughnuts that there must have been false prophets among them that said, this shall not come upon you, and said, peace, peace, and that the Lord is going to come and deliver you, and that these prophets received a very responsive hearing, but if there was a voice that said, this is judgment, from which there'll be no escape, repent, and turn to the God of your fathers, that man was probably thrown over the brow of the hill, and we're going to see that same scenario played out yet again.

It's being played out now, that Inga wants us to make a trip in October.

I'm going with trepidation, because of the violent reaction that came to my last message that prepare yourself for devastation that's going to come, that there must be a death and resurrection of Israel, and the shouts and the screams that followed, the Lord was there.

What will it be now?

And false prophets are very welcome, who are soothing and assuring, and this too shall pass, and God is with you, don't worry, you'll never again have to suffer that. How many times has Israel suffered, because it has given its hearing to those who give it a false comfort rather than a true? I'm thinking about Elijah and the false prophets. Do you remember how they made their sacrifice, and they called upon their God, and they danced and they performed, and they cut themselves and cried out, and it went on for hours? They really and literally expected that they had a God who was going to answer, but no answer came. It was a final moment of encounter and extremity, but there was no God to hear and to answer, and it may be something like that in the final day too. People really believe that they're going to be saved out of distress, and what does God say in Ezekiel 20, for the rebels that shall be purged out, who have transgressed against him, who are they? Those who do not believe that this is going to come upon them. So the rabbis established a rabbinical Judaism. They recast the whole devastation as an instructive historical eruption, and therefore the destruction of the temple in 70 CE, common era. Jews do not want to use the word any reference to Christ, Anno Domini being the year of the Lord. So that the destruction was no caesura, because the tradition took up the frayed ends of time and knotted them. The rabbinical tradition took up the frayed ends and knotted them. I remember when Paul Volk raised the question, what ever happened to the veil that was rent from top to bottom when Jesus was crucified? Because they went on for another 40 years of conducting their temple worship until the end came.

Well, what happened to the torn rent veil that no man could have torn? They say it was like 6 inches thick and torn from top to bottom, not bottom to top.

And Paul went on to say the only thing they could have done was to have knotted it together and gone on.

Talk about making how did Adam and Eve cover themselves? Isn't there something about men?

There's God's statement writ large in the rent veil and there's men knotting it up and tying it up to do business as usual and go on as if a caesura had not taken place. As I was saying, there are so many applications we do the same thing.

Business as usual, we go on.

God brings the devastation, He brings the dealing, we find some way to interpret it that makes us come out in the best light. We knot up the frayed ends and we go on and miss the whole point.

And what do we invite?

A yet greater devastation 40 years later or however long it takes. If we're going to speak these things to an unwilling people, we ourselves have to be totally free from all deception, all imagined things that as we would like to see them, our eye has to be so clear, we ourselves have had to be the recipients of the judgments of God and as Gary shared with us the other night, be brought into the places of the darkness of God, the deepest places and to remain there and abide there and not strike our own sparks because a people are going to be brought into such a darkness and we have to come to them out of the knowledge of the God whom we ourselves have met in that place in order to be a comfort to them. What's the difference between a false prophet and the true? A false prophet has no stomach for the darkness. A false prophet will tie up the loose ends and go on with business as usual. His Melody Land, his recreation center down there in North Carolina that Jimmy Baker had and polish it up and brush it up and put it up for business as usual again, not wanting to learn from the judgment or suffer the stigma of the judgment, but tidy it up and go on. As I described to you, the Dachau that I visited in 1952 or 1953, that was a place of horror.

It had the stench of death. The ashes were still in the ovens. Prisoners, refugees were still living in that camp.

I mean, the reality of it broke through my categories. I could no longer go on with the naive Jewish self-righteous view of good guys and bad guys. I had touched a horror that eclipsed those categories. For me thereafter, it was only all bad guys and I was one of them. What is read as judgment and received as the passion of the Jewish people is transmuted and made into something other than what God intended it. If the Tremendum interrupts everything, the entire past lies under its mark. Here's one of the most honest statements in this book. Nothing of the past can be omitted, neither suppressed, nor described in such a way as to blunt its evidence. He does not support what the Jewish community has done with the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD and made into it a new form of Judaism and came out smelling like a rose.

He's saying we missed it.

And he's saying now about this Tremendum that everything of the entire past lies under its mark. What he's saying is that which is past is now.

There's some kind of continuum.

Even as a secular philosophical man, he's sensing something of the truth that God has shown us even in the Scripture. Nothing of the past can be omitted, neither suppressed, nor described in such a way as to blunt its evidence. The whole of the past constitutes the environment of the modern Jew as the Tremendum marks its center. So he's really calling for something that I honor and trust that a voice like that will be heard. I can't imagine that this book received any kind of acceptance in the Jewish community. Well, those are the things that I've marked. I don't doubt it that it was too radical a voice, too disruptive, too irritating. He was calling for something that men don't want to perform. And yet, when I came to the end of this book, I almost felt off my seat.

I don't know that I should share that with you.

I'll look to the Lord, because he finally came to some conclusion.

He had to find it.

And the question was, what could conceivably justify such a magnitude of Jewish suffering?

And you know what his final answer was?

That through the suffering, the Jewish people themselves would become deified and be an answer to the world. That the suffering was a provision for our deification, and we are the answer to mankind. What about the Antichrist who comes into the temple and takes the place of God and says that he is God? There's that Antichrist spirit of the self-exaltation of man that finds a way to interpret even his catastrophes that finally, in the last analysis, makes him to come out not only smelling as a rose, but to be even very God. You can imagine my report when I submitted it on Jewish responses to the Holocaust, and I began to share those things.

You know what the remarkable thing is? Elie Wiesel holds the same view.

Rabbi Berkovitz, virtually every prominent source, when you read them through to the last page, in one form or another, suggest and imply that this is the meaning of Jewish suffering.

Because what is the other alternative?

There can only be one other meaning to Jewish suffering. The judgments of God by eight people who have forsaken the true knowledge of him, not walked in his covenants, nor fulfilled their obligation to be his witness people, and have suffered the judgments that he had forewarned that would come upon us in the latter days, in complete accordance with our sin, or double for our sin, or seven times more. If you do not accept that biblical statement for your suffering, you will in the last analysis come up with another that shows why it is you suffered from the beginning. Because when I made my report, I said, these articulate men who finally express the subversive thought about the deification of the Jewish people are only the audible statement, but how long have we secretly entertained that in our bosom as a nation that God himself sees and knows and is judging, which explains why it is that we have had to suffer the devastations that we have, for we have exalted and elevated ourselves above God.

Just like the Germans did. Just like the Germans did.

They also explained the historical beliefs of the Jews that they had to resist every judgment that God sent, including Babylon and Roman and Babylon.

They felt that they were resisting the enemy.

I like to imagine that Jeremiah said it to be. He said, well, there is a remnant of the God who wanted to show them compassion in the midst of the judgment, and they still resisted that. And the true prophet, God, had to go and suffer the evil. They chose to construe that as suffering for their virtue, rather than suffering for their sin. And this is an enormously important point for us. How much of our suffering is for our sin? And how much of our suffering is for our redemptive character? You know, a lot of our suffering we have brought upon ourselves by our own foolishness and sin. It has no redemptive value, whatever.

It's pure chastisement and punishment.

And the consequence of that sin, that invites it. The other kind of suffering that is redemptive is what we freely receive in an obedience and a walk toward sonship. And we must not confuse the one with the other as Israel has done.

Because of that self-celebration.

And if this has been an underlying motif and a kind of national pride and exaltation of a people that thought that they are the answer to the world, and you know what the ironic thing is? God intended them to be an answer to the world. A nation of priests and the light of the world, what an ironic thing that if they had only submitted to God, they would have been that. But in their rebellion and independence from God, seeking to establish their call in the light of their own sparks, they not only have not become that, but given the world a false messianism. From Karl Marx to Sigmund Freud to Steven Spielberg and E.T. and movies and every kind of harebrained kind of thing that has affected millions, but not for the eternal good.

And yet at the end what?

Despite that track record, God, because he has made a promise and a covenant and given a call to be a nation of priests in the light of the world, says that the gift and callings of God are irrevocable.

He will fulfill it.

And this nation, despite its historic apostasy and opposition and presumption against God, will be that blessing to all the families of the earth, but not in the chutzpah and the arrogance and self-sufficiency that have characterized us, but in a brokenness and humiliation that comes from the final, last days' dealings of God, where the point will finally be brought home that even the Holocaust failed to establish. That out of that brokenness and the return on the back of mules and litters comes this people that God himself will restore out of the nations to which they had been flung and will suffer such last day trials that the redeemed of the Lord will return and mourning and sighing will flee away and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads.

What a saga! What a drama!

What a redemptive epic that God has established from the whole of historic time and is going to conclude in our generation. We need to appreciate that all the more as we are his principal agent in the fulfillment.

Reggie?

I would like to ask you personally about the death of two great people, especially the Gardeners of Jordan and Israel, who together have been most prominent in developing and self-establishing traditions. There is an obscure passage in Daniel 11, verse 14, that I don't believe answers to what has been proposed of a third century Syrian ruler, the brethren in the description of the German race and their persecution of the Jewish people. In just those days they anticipate the rise of the final Antichrist, and here is the verse. And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south, also the robbers of thy people. And if you look at Isaiah 42 that happens before Getu about the robbers of thy people, this is not an exhibit of renegades from the Jewish nation but of a people who have been responsible for the peeling and stripping of national Israel. And it answers to the description of the robbers of thy people, who put them in prison and made them a spoil. The robbers of thy people shall adopt themselves to establish the vision, but they shall fall. And the vision that Hitler proposed was a third rite, a thousand year reign of a superlate. And the vision of Daniel which is sitting up here is the kingdom becoming the possession of the same people on high, by the cloud-comers who would bring to an end and shatter all the usurping Gentile powers. So the fact of the kingdom being established, but anything short of life from the dead, the interdiction of supernatural has been the chronic propensity of human people who seek to establish the vision and are established into the fall.

So there's that reciprocal.

I wasn't going to state that until when this man is to give us our understanding through the Jewish nation in there as a percentage result, because it's just the truth of the German nation who were there. There's an echo of that that came up in our discussion of community where ironically the German theologian Bonhoeffer says, anyone who comes to community with the vision for community brings the seeds of destruction with him. That anything that's holy, that's of God, must be entirely outworked by the importation of his life given to the people who are called and respond in obedience in the daily outworking of that life together.

You cannot come with your own game plan. You simply come in obedience.

There was the same call to Abraham to follow me into the land that I will show you. There's something about vision, even when it might be correct to an extent, that is our vision that has yet the element of pride, human imagining, fancy, idealism that leads itself not only to disappointment with those who fail to live up to your hope for it, but to a contempt for those who fail. And therefore we have to come and just simply come as the broken people of God who have no strength in themselves and look to him for the unfolding of the life day by day as he's pleased to meet it out. That's a tremendous point about vision. So this is remarkably instructive in every way and really gives us a backdrop for what the final episodes will be and must be, seeing that it has, so to speak, fallen on deaf ears. And if we still have the copies of what I circulated yesterday in the Holocaust Museum, the donors with the million dollar donations and doctor and missus so-and-so and the honorific titles and all the things that you want to gasp and bend over, that there's a people who have merchandised in the bones of the victims are making hay, are finding distinction in society and recognition because they're endowing a museum and so missing the point of God and thinking that by a museum or a program of education that a future catastrophe can be averted, as if it could be bought by money and not understanding that God is still waiting for people to acknowledge him.

It's like what we've done today with every movement. We talk about awareness.

I get a chuckle out of all these groups that want to make people more sensitive to humanity's suffering by unawareness parades and awareness this and awareness that, same kind of thing.

And it's so shallow and it doesn't help the situation at all. It may be it's a prototype of what it was before.

I don't know if I'll share with you my most recent experience at the University of Washington in Seattle where I went to a Holocaust conference.

It was a terrible disappointment.

I was finally forbidden to speak after, in fact, I was cut off in my third public statement. Each one was a cry in an attempt to turn the people toward the consideration of God. Though it was attended by rabbis and Christian clergymen and scholars, God was shuffled to a backseat or not considered at all. But what I saw was a whole class of men that have grown up who have made careers out of the Holocaust. Professional men who sift through the bones and are statisticians, you know, over the spectacle of death but have not once sought its deepest explanation or are yet even now willing to consider God. And that I, in my little weak, pathetic way, trying somehow in the midst of that to sound the theme of God had finally to be shut down and to be told you need to recognize Dr. Katz, I was awarded the title, that this is not an evangelical function.

This is a conference of scholars.

And I thought to myself, that's exactly why we need Holocausts. We invite them and bring them upon ourselves because we have determined what is secular and what is sacred. And we will not allow the sacred to penetrate our secular. We have our vested academic interests. We have our careers to pursue and our PhDs to obtain and our conferences to establish. And we're not going to let any echo or sound of God disrupt our proceedings. And it's that very hubris, that humanistic defiance of God and the elevation of men and their interest above God and will not hear God, that finally invites and makes necessary the devastations that must come. And I left that place so bowed over, so... Could you have written something afterwards to their little pamphlet that they might have...

I doubt if I'll ever be invited back. I was an embarrassment. I was a stink.

Very much like a character that is described in Elie Wiesel's first and greatest book called The Night, which established his fame of his own Holocaust reminiscence, that he was a member of a community in Transylvania, which is today Romania and the Carpathian Mountains way out. And every Jewish community, it was toward the latter part of the war, and every Jewish community had already been victimized, but they had somehow been able to survive and thought, this shall not come upon us.

There's that optimism. There's that human hope.

Until finally one day there was the rumbling of the tanks and the heavy equipment and the dust on the horizon until it came closer and closer and the Nazis came into town and set in motion the things that resulted in the devastation of that community also. The most pathetic scene of the night before they were called to be 6 a.m. at the Red Train Station in the marketplace. They were working all through the night to bury their heirlooms, thinking that somebody would come back and be able to rescue them and go on doing business as usual. But he describes that sometime before the Germans arrived, a man had escaped somehow from a concentration camp, a Jewish man, and came to their community and cried out to them a warning. He was some kind of, he looked to them like some stunted and perverted freak speaking some bizarre thing about fire and torment and destruction and smoke and they didn't want to hear it and they shuffled him off from place to place to get rid of that ugly and painful presence until finally the day came when they experienced the very thing for which he came to forewarn them. So it's another picture of God's mercy sending some kind of cry of reality that men don't want to hear.

Business as usual.

So... You've got to keep making us cry.

Yeah. Whether it's hurt or not.

We have an obligation or their blood is upon our hands. The Spirit of God is upon me for he hath anointed me. If the Son of Man required an anointing to fulfill his messianic task, what will we require? So let's just, I don't know what, conclude with... Yeah, we want to pray for Arthur A. Cohen.

Arthur A. Cohen. There's a picture of him in the back of the book if anybody wants to see it. You can come by.

I just looked at it again this morning somewhere between 5 and 7 a.m. and I thought there's a man...

There's a pain in that face. There's such a cry. The eyes are almost like somebody help me.

From the most erudite, sophisticated Ph.D. going. My language, my knowledge, my insight, there's none that can compare and yet I'm without answer. I recognize that something has happened in history and time that has completely devastated our categories but what's an answer to it?

Who proudly describes himself as being anti-Christian and has publicly written books against Christendom and Christianity. So to what shall he turn?

He thinks he has seen a Christianity that he can repudiate. But the unhappy, the melancholy thing is he's never seen apostolic reality. I have a feeling that a man like this, no matter what his Jewish thinking and categories, if he would once glimpse the undeniable reality of the presence of God, of the God who is a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of the people of Israel, he would fall down before it and be saved. So wherever he is, God knows he may be suffering AIDS or some other kind of thing, maybe unto death. Certainly he's a man who is despairing and he's a statement of maybe a remnant of the people of Israel for whom God intends salvation and return. So let's pray for this people as we center in for this man and hear his cry. A real lever of truth in a way that would make many of us ashamed who are Christians and have not his passion and his insistence. Cohen, by the way, means priest, as some of you may know.

Hallelujah.

Lord, we raised up Arthur A. Cohen. We're so glad that you know him and you know him from his mother's womb. You know his whole history, you know his academic career, you know his struggles, you've seen his agonizing, you've seen his cry, you've heard his cry in the night hours, my God.

You know when he's banged his fist into walls.

You know when he's broken his head trying to find some philosophical theological answer and has exhausted all of his categories that are so commendable and numerous. Lord, there's a cry of despair, there's a search, there's a man trying to understand where is the God of his fathers and how could this have happened and what does it mean? And senses that ominously it might come again that education is not going to save us. Lord, we pray your mercy that your arm will be stretched out to him still. We pray, my God, that not the least of the purposes for which you have convened this school is that there are people who could have heard a heart cry out of this and raised up their own heart cry for his salvation that you needed and waited for that to be released, my God, to save him out of death. And that we will have the eternal joy of finding him, my God, somewhere near and around the throne of the Lamb. We pray for the Arthur Coens, my God, of your people Israel.

Oh, God, hear their cry.

They may be so-called enemies of the faith.

They may despise Christianity.

They may have every reason, my God, in their experience to do so and have not understood and have been turned from you. Your name might be anathema in their mouths, but we pray your mercy. Come, precious God, by dream, by revelation, by witness, by something foolish, by some Hubert Humphrey on the campus, some buck-toothed guy with a broken nose and freckles and his grammar is atrocious and whose preaching saved Paul Volk. Come also and save such a man as this.

We love him.

Our hearts, Lord, go out for him and we ask, my God, salvation. Come, precious God, and a people who are deluded still, a people who have turned back again to their liberalism, back again to their hope in man, back again to their foolish categories, back to their hope that education is the answer. My God, Lord, warn, bring a warning, my God, sound a voice, send your anointed messengers into their midst. Precious God, we pray for this people that you'll bring a remnant out from the place of deception, my God, into the most glorious light of your Son, even their own Messiah, Yeshua the Messiah, Jesus the Christ in whose name we pray.
