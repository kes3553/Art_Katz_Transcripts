Sonship with the Father 1 of 2 - Art Katz

So, I think the Lord wants to continue from his statement yesterday morning, if you didn't hear it, if you were not here, see Simon about getting a copy of it. It has to do with fatherhood, and calling upon God as Father, as being more than just a little amenity, a little piece of polite punctuation, that that ability and that privilege is fraught with unspeakable significance. Because the whole issue of father is the issue of God, and if we do not give him his proper designation, we might well be barking up the wrong tree. Because merely to use the three-letter word God can be a route to deception. It's too ambiguous and lends itself to many uses, particularly for those who are deceitful in their hearts. So, God gives certain designations to make sure we're on the right track. The God of Jacob, the God of Israel, is among the most profound designations that God gives. And the Church, the Gentile Church that walks at that kind of acknowledgement forfeits a knowledge of God in reality and dimension that can only come with the agreement of that designation. God chooses it because it's offensive to the Gentile to see if they will balk or they will swallow and receive whole how he chooses to identify himself as the God of Jacob.

The God of Jacob. Isn't that remarkable?

With all that Jacob Kenosha, Schemer and usurper and all those kinds of things to which Jacob had to pass before he became Israel, God yet clings to the name and identifies himself as the God of Jacob. Because he was with Jacob throughout his entire scheming career until he came to the end of it and became the Israel of God and the progenitor of an entire nation. So, we need to pay attention to how God designates himself.

Is it Genesis 15 or 17?

He speaks to Abraham in a new way and introduces himself as, I am God Almighty.

I think it's El Shaddai. He had not before ever used that designation. Why does he use it now?

Because he says, walk thou before me and be thou blameless.

I am God Almighty.

Because you'll not be able, you'll not conduct yourself in that way except by my almighty-ness. So, as I give you a call that is beyond any capacity in yourself to fulfill, I'm also giving you the indication of the means whereby it is to be fulfilled.

I am God Almighty.

So, we need to be attentive to the way that God designates himself. Because the greatest tragedy is to lose God as God even while we are enunciating the word God. So, one of the greatest provisions is God the Father. And that saves us as yesterday we shared from ambiguity. It's a specific God that we have in mind. And Father is not only his title, it's what he is in himself as his person. Because the word Father not only indicates authority but something of a kind that will evoke affection and as an affectionate regard that God wants and obedience to him out of affection and out of love. And so, because there's a father, there's also a son.

No son, no father.

So, here we have the great mystery of father and son. That Jesus, how shall we say it, certifies that there's a father by virtue of his own sonship. So, when I was confronted with the New Testament 41 years ago and read of Jesus for the first time as a Jewish atheist, where he said the words that I speak are not my words but the words that my father has given me or that I've come from the father or if you see me, you see the father. I did not know there was a father until there was a son to proclaim him. The issue of the father is the issue of the son. And so that we are called to be sons has got something to do then with our own relationship with Father that has not changed but remains. So, in today's selection in the Oswald Chambers, my utmost was highest. In fact, the last few days, just as coincidental, have you noticed how often it is that the devotional readings for the day are right smack dab on the very thing that is at hand with God. Yesterday is titled, Prayer in the Father's House. Today is entitled, Prayer in the Father's Honor.

So, let me read you part of this.

If the Son of God is born into my mortal flesh, is his holy innocence and simplicity and oneness with the Father getting a chance to manifest itself in me?

Tremendous question.

If Jesus was the Son by which the Father was made manifest and his thoughts expressed, is that same phenomenon continuing now in the sons that we are? If we have been birthed by the Holy Spirit and have become sons and that the Son is incarnate in us, is he still serving the Father as he did when he was walking in his own body? Is he still speaking only the words that the Father gave him now as then? Is he still as obedient now as then to the Father?

Only now it's through us as sons? This is a remarkable continuum.

It did not end when Jesus finished his earthly course. I was taken up to the throne of heaven. It continues still in the sons that have been birthed by his Spirit, but by the same phenomenon of serving the Father and honoring the Father. The Son of God is born into me by the direct act of God and I, as a child of God, have to exercise the right of a child, the right of being always face to face with my Father.

Am I continually saying with amazement to my common sense life, why do you want to turn me off here? Don't you know that I must be about my Father's business?

One of the earliest pronouncements in the youth of Jesus when he was delayed in Jerusalem and his parents learned later that he wasn't with them and found him back in the temple area hearing and questioning the authorities in the law and he was astonished that they were concerned about his absence.

Don't you know he said that I have to be about my Father's business?

So this issue of a son cognizant that his purpose for being is his Father's business comes as one of the earliest expressions even in the youth of Jesus as a child. And so what Seamus is asking, you as a child, have you come to that same recognition in your relationship with the Father?

Are you about the Father's business? Jesus said, I must be about my Father's business. There's an imperative because the son who is not about the Father's business has forfeited being the son. The whole purpose of being the son is to be about your Father's business. Got the idea?

Whatever the circumstances may be, the holy, innocent, eternal child must be in contact with his Father.

Catch the must here. Must be about his Father's business. Must be in contact with his Father. I only wrote in one word that Chambers did not employ. Must be about a conscious relationship with his Father.

This is a chosen voluntary imperative.

There's a must. Because how can you be about your Father's business if you're not in a relationship with the Father? How can you know what that business is or how it should be prosecuted or performed except out of a relationship with the Father?

So the thing that distinguishes Jesus and his whole three and a half year ministry was the continual and frequent prayer with the Father.

Not just to receive instruction.

It may well be that he never once obtained an explicit instruction of what he was to do that day. But he obtained a communion with the Father.

A sense of reality.

Because God the Father is the pivot of reality. And then walked out today in what was gained and imbued in him in that devotional time in relationship of a son to a Father.

We need to dwell on that.

It's so alien to our consideration because we are so expedient and utilitarian in our mentality. Like we'll give our Father or any authority a minimal attention only with regard to what has to be obtained for us by it.

But that's no longer devotion. That's commerce.

Jesus had a devotional relationship with the Father. The Father was dear to him as the Son was dear to the Father. And unless that is the environment of the relationship between Father and Son, nothing else follows. So here we are talking about sonship and sons and sons of God. But it's with an American Western utilitarian mentality that is mechanical. And we've missed the whole emotional warmth of a cherished and dear relationship of a son to a Father. Maybe because we have not known that in our own earthly life.

But we've got to know it spiritually. Chambers is facing us with these questions. There's a must be in conscious contact with his Father. If you read today's chapter in the book of Proverbs, today is August 8th.

It has the most remarkable statement in the last part of that about the pre-incarnate life of the Son of God before he came to the earth. That he was with the Father as a cherished son and child and creation was established with him and that it was always his delight. It's a remarkable glimpse of what that pre-incarnate life must have been that Jesus forfeited when he came down to earth. We can't begin to imagine what that was for him. And the sacrifice of leaving it, the actuality of that communion and presence with the Father to be separate and come into the hostile environment that the world is, for the world is at enmity with God. But to maintain that essential connection, though physically distant, by conscious contact through devotion called prayer. Not prayer of petition, but prayer of devotion marked the relationship of Jesus as a son with the Father.

There would have been no being about his father's business if it was not first about his father's relationship. Chambers asked, am I simple enough to identify myself with my Lord in this way? Is he getting his wonderful way in me?

Is God realizing that his son is formed in me or have I carefully put him on one side?

Because of the clamor of these days, everyone is clamoring for what? There's no room for the Son of God just now. No room for quiet, holy communion with the Father.

Is the Son of God praying in me or am I dictating to him? Is he ministering in me as he did in the days of his flesh and ministering through me? So these are wonderful questions about the continuation of the remarkable father-son relationship that Jesus established and exemplified in his earthly walk and is given to us to continue.

Will there be no fulfillment of the Father's business?

It's not a mechanical thing that God will dispense to anyone who is religiously willing to work. It's given only to sons, because sons have a regal responsibility. The issue of sonship is the issue of government and participation in the rule of God.

And that's more than just a mechanical ability.

It issues out of sonship, out of a relationship with Father that is emotive and affectionate and regards him and is jealous to be about his business and about his name and about his honor. And that's why praying as Jesus encouraged us, praying this way, our Father which art in heaven, is more than just a nice suggestion. You know that wonderful scripture, the call to Israel, an exordation, a rebuke even.

If I be a father, where is my honor? I think it's in Hosea, one of the minor prophets. If I be a father, where is my honor? Why do you call me father and only use me as an expedient for your purposes? Where is my honor?

Where is the regard that is duly from a son by which I am esteemed and sought for, not for what I can do for you, but for what I am in myself? Of course, I think somewhere he said, the Father is greater than I. So the Father is the hub.

I don't have a word.

There's no English term appropriate to show the centrality of God as Father.

Everything issues from Him. He sends the Spirit down from the throne. He sent His Son.

The Father is the wisdom, the ancient of days. So Jesus Himself, right as He was in His humanity, never acted out of it, but only what He saw from the Father or was given by the Father. And if that's what typified Him as Son, what about us?

So are we then at liberty to do our thing? I'm not talking about carnal things. I'm talking about religious things or spiritual things.

Are we at liberty to speak our words, do our thoughts, run our business, conduct our ministries, send out our mailings, advertise this, perform that? And in fact, is that not the description of the way in which Christendom conducts itself today and is not ashamed to use the word son and talk about sonship as if they actually occupy that place and bear little reflection to Jesus who would never once ever initiate anything out of Himself?

Listen to this statement from A.W. Tozer. How many people know that name?

Who was himself a remarkable Son of God and a prophetic man, talking about man and religious men. In their pride, men assert their will and claim ownership of the earth. Well, for this time it is true that this is man's world. God is admitted only by man's sufferance. I've always been astonished, if I can interrupt myself, how little acknowledgement is made in the world about God and that men think that they can conduct the affairs of nation and the affairs of state independent of Him when we're told clearly that God Himself is wisdom. So that a Bush or anyone, any head of state, they make plans, they connive this, they draft treaties, they're after Iraq to come up with a constitution.

What's taking you guys so long? Get it together. Get this act together. Do this, perform that.

Or we'll send our armed forces or we'll bring greater force to bear in arms and expense.

We'll perform this. We'll get this through. No acknowledgement of God.

He's shaking the earth and bringing catastrophes and showing the cost of living independently of Him. But no one seems to take note that the earth is the Lord's and the nation's in the fullness thereof as if He's not a God to be consulted or that He's not there to be consulted and as if He has nothing to say and no advice to give and no wisdom to express by which we can find our way out of this mess.

Have you been struck by that? Or have you taken it for granted? This is the way it should work.

The world is one thing, the church is another. Let the world go on by its own wisdom and we'll conduct ourselves in our own understanding of God and never the twain shall meet. If we have any prophetic call, we need to deeply be chafed at the anachronism, the terrible injustice, I don't have a word for it, the anomaly, the disgraceful neglect of God who has created the world and has set aside as if He has of no consequence for the world. And that we as Christians conduct our own business and even our own ministries or our own communities in very much that same spirit. And the world is not going to change if the church itself is acting in independence of God.

So let me continue this.

God is admitted only by man's sufferance as if the Lord is waiting with His hat in His hands at the door if the world will let Him in.

He's treated as a visiting royalty in a democratic country.

Everyone takes his name upon his lips, especially at certain seasons. He is feeded, celebrated, and him, but behind all this flattery, men hold firmly to their own right of self-determination. What I am reading is the antithesis of sonship. If you want to know what something is, one of the most profound ways to learn it is not to read the synonyms, but the antonyms. See what the opposite is tells you what the thing itself is.

And that's what this is.

Tozer is nailing the world for its rejection of God. The way the world conducts itself by giving, treating God ceremonially, but not actually. Opening up the sessions of Congress by reciting a prayer or swearing someone into office by having him put his hand on the Bible.

Now they're drafting new laws by which it doesn't have to be the Bible. It could be the Koran or some New Age thing.

Whatever it is that suits the conviction of the one who's swearing in, that will suffice.

It doesn't have to be the Bible anymore.

Showing how ceremonial, shallow it was in the beginning.

A gesture.

God is again being used, not being revered. I'm reading you an antithesis of sonship.

You want to know where sonship is?

Exactly the opposite to what I am describing here.

What Tozer is describing.

Where God is celebrated, but behind this flattery, men hold firmly to their light of self-determination.

Don't get in my way. I don't want to hear what your thought is. I have already my own determination of what I'm going to do, even for your sake. Even for the church. Even for your kingdom. Don't tell me.

Very opposite of Jesus, who would not do anything or say anything except he had first seen of the hurt of the Father.

He had no program of his own.

As long as man is allowed to play host, he will honor God with his attention, but always he must remain a guest and never seek to be the Lord.

There's a scant acknowledgement.

You may be God, but I'm unwilling to acknowledge the rest of what that means, that you're also Lord. What was the first angelic pronouncement at Bethlehem? It was born through this day in the city of David.

A Messiah, the Lord.

The first announcement talks about God's provision for sin and atonement, but also in connection with the Lord. And I think that in the greatest number of instances where we have difficulty in witnessing to unsaved people who even acknowledge that God is God, but they will not surrender to God as Lord.

That's what he's saying here.

People are willing to make this shallow acknowledgement, but they don't want the implication of God as Lord. They want to make their own determinations. Man will have it understood that this is his world.

He will make its laws and decide how it shall be run.

God is permitted to decide nothing. You're very opposite of what a son is, in which God is permitted to decide everything. Everything, whether you're going to school, college, what course you're taking, what program you're getting married on, should you, and to whom, when, your money that's being saved, your future, your time, who makes those determinations? Unless those determinations are totally the Lord's, how then are you the sons or daughters of the Most High? Because the thing about sonship is its totality. If there's any exception, any veto power, any area in which we reserve our right to make these determinations, yes, God can decide the cosmic issues, but the lesser things like my money, my time, my leisure, my future, my choice of career, my business, my marriage, I'll take care of that.

Nothing doing. Nothing doing. Sonship is total. There's a must. Must be about your father's business. Must be in conscious relationship with him.

Must be a total yieldingness to God the Father, who is the ancient of days, who is the wisdom of wisdom and righteousness.

He's the all in all. He's the great God.

That we earthlings, we pieces of dust should think ourselves capable of making a wise decision independent of him? The fact that it works is not reason enough. The fact that we even prosper by its working is not reason enough, because the issue of a son is not whether something works or whether I will prosper by its working. The issue of the son is, will this eventuate in the glory of God the Father?

Did you get that? If you got that, you can go home now. If you got that, you got everything. If you got that, you got everything.

The issue of a son is not whether it works, not whether it will prosper. The issue of a son is, does this redound to the glory of God the Father?

Unless there's a jealousy for that glory, you have forfeited sonship.

It's sacrilegious to invoke God in a shallow and ceremonial way without any real intent of honoring him.

If I be the Father, where is my honor?

And if you're not honoring the earthly expressions of his fatherhood in the authority that he has established in the body and in the church, how are you honoring him who gave it? Because Paul said, no man takes for himself an office. Paul is not an apostle because he chose to. He's an apostle because he was called. And being called is given the authority appropriate to that call. And that authority calls for a certain acknowledgement and recognition from the church, which for the want of a better word would be called honoring. And you want to know, you dear saints, you dear American Western Canadian saints, honor is no longer a vital word in the English language.

That's why you're not even understanding me now. How can you? How can you understand what it means to honor? You're too young.

You have not my advantage of having an earlier history when that kind of word was still being used and was understood. Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother, that your years might be long in the earth, something like that.

Is it the fourth commandment? You shall honor. What does that mean? What if he doesn't deserve it? What if he's an insensitive father? What if he's indifferent? What if he's reckless? What?

No, God says honor. You honor him because not of his track record, not of his performance, but because of his role, his office, which I have conferred so that to honor him is to honor me.

And if you'll not honor him, you're dishonoring me. And if there's no honor, what then is the world and what is life in the world?

It's a jungle of disrespect and contempt for authority that we see with our kids today and in the courts and in the classroom and with the teachers. The whole complex structure of what we call civilization that saves us from a jungle existence is destroyed when honor is removed.

So why won't men honor the father?

Why does God have to sting Israel and say, why do you call me God the father?

If I'm your father, where is my honor? Why does he raise the question? Because they've not extended it.

While at the same time, they're performing their sacrifices. The smoke is going up, the sacrifices are being hacked and hewed, the priest are laying them upon the altar, and God is complaining, where is my honor?

How come?

Because he sees right through the subterfuge of the easy ability to hack something in pieces and lay it on the altar and put fire under it and call that the sacrifice that God requires. As he has his life in us, he is as obedient now to the father as he was him because he has not lost his sonship. The distinctive of his sonship is obedience to the father in everything, the honoring and reverence of the father while he was in his own body.

But now that he's in our bodies, has anything changed?

The father is still the son and subject of what a son is about to reverence and to honor and to call upon. And I can't say enough for the importance of calling upon God the father and that Jesus himself made that his continual practice. My father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. My father, if this cup can pass for me, but if it cannot, everything was father, father, father, father, father. Every communication is prefigured by the word father.

He called upon the father and it's more than just a little courtesy. It's more than a technique.

It's a profound acknowledgement that this father is the son and substance of all things. Not only is he to be honored by the act that will follow, but the enablement for that act comes also from him. He's both the source and the purpose for life and being. And the church has lost this sense of God the father.

As the brother, I quoted his book I had with me yesterday.

He said the Charismatics have honored the Holy Spirit and forfeited the father and the evangelicals and fundamentalists celebrate Jesus and have forfeited the father. But to forfeit the father is to forfeit God. For the father is at the nexus and his himself, very God, and the source of all things, including the son himself. So he is equal, all of the persons of the Godhead equal to the father and yet Jesus says he's greater than I. And the completion of the ministry of Jesus, as we've said now a few times, is to bring all the kingdoms unto himself and turn them over to the father that the father might be all in all. So the consciousness of God the father has come to be useful. And our ability to call upon him, upon him as father, is a great privilege, a great distinction.

And who is it that has that right?

Who is it that can dare call upon God father? Because to use the word intonates and implies not only an honoring but a sense of what that word resonates and a warm affectionate and reverential regard for father. Because just to use it as an invocation in a mechanical way destroys it.

It's not God honoring father.

If it's only something that has got to begin a prayer for us to be correct, it's no longer valid. If you're going to say father, my father, my God, it's got to be spoken as a son and not as a mechanical necessity to make your prayer acceptable so that you might receive its benefit.

Got the idea? There's a catch here.

And so it requires a remarkable grace just simply to call upon God the father. But if we cannot call upon God as father, to whom then shall we turn?

And to whom shall we plead? And what shall we do with our petitions?

And how will we find guidance and direction in the complexity of the life to which we're called in these last days?

This is the whole matter. If we miss it here, we lose it.

So I'm raising the question that Carl Bott raises in this last of his books. These are the fragments that remain after 14 volumes of church dogmatics, which I have upstairs in my library. These little pieces that are so of the choice. And he raises the question, where does anyone get the gall, the chutzpah, the presumption to call upon God the father as if he's your buddy buddy?

Who are you? Where do you get that?

Unless the privilege is given you, and in fact more than that, unless God himself is requiring it of you and gives you the grace to perform it. And that's the point that I want to read right here that comes from our relationship with Jesus. Bott writes, how does it come about that through Jesus Christ people are set in the relation to God in which the problem of his nature and existence is no longer a problem for them?

It's a great question.

How astounding that earthlings, pieces of dust, he knows our friends, we are as best, can dare have a conversation with God the Father, the Creator, the Redeemer, the Most High, the Almighty, the Ineffable, the Unhonorable, that no man has ever seen, and whose eyes are too holy to look upon ourselves.

That we, in that condition, can dare call upon him?

Thus Carl Bott is raising the staggering question, and we ourselves need to be staggered by it, or we will not appreciate what our privilege is as believers to make that call.

Got the idea you guys?

Our whole spiritual life needs to come into a focus of greater intensity and seriousness and comprehension, or we are just knocking about in the Kingdom of God and our little present or eternal value. And somehow the subject of Father and our ability to call upon God the Father in a meaningful and significant way gets to the grip of the whole mystery of the faith itself. That mere earthlings have been given the privilege to call upon the ineffable, that means unspeakable, God as Father with the intimacy as if we know him and as if he's our Father, though he's in Heaven. That's how Jesus called upon them, and that's how God would have us to call upon him. No man can call upon the Father except through me or except by me, and even to call upon the Father is a preposterous suggestion from those earthlings that we are.

It's a remarkable privilege.

It's a bridging of time and eternity to call upon God as Father. We need to be staggered by the immensity of what that means.

It's not a light thing, a piece of traffic, something that we perform at will. It's not a little cutesy piece of punctuation, Father.

It's a solemn, deep, reverential acknowledgement that he waits to hear as it is rightly expressed only by the grace which is given because no man can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. Yes, he can mouth the word Lord, that invocation that human speech can perform, but to speak the word Lord with recognition is impossible to man except by the Holy Spirit. The same principle is true, I'm suggesting, to call upon God the Father except a grace is given for that call because if that grace is not given and we're only invoking the word out of our own capability for speech, he's not hearing it, he's not receiving it, and our petition falls to the ground. I would have gained and obtained nothing which may well explain why it is that so little progress is being made by the church in the world and so little of the reality of the heavenly kingdom is being established because perhaps it may be that our prayer is not heard because it's too much our prayer.

It's a mechanical invocation.

We have not recognized the immensity of the preposterous thing that we should communicate with God the Father, the ancient of days, the creator of the heavens and the earth and all that in it is, who has ever existed, holy, holy, holy, that it takes a grace to call upon God the Father. The Father as Father and not only is that grace given but it is given through Jesus who even enjoins us to use that call that whatsoever you ask the Father in my name it will be given you. But if you don't ask the Father there's nothing given and I have to say 41 years in the faith if I would assess any percentage of the prayers that I have sent up to the Father I would say at best 5%, 10% most. All my prayers are almost universally to the Lord though he has said pray to the Father in my name I'm praying to him.

Why? Because there's something about the word Father that catches me in the gut. I'm not comfortable with the word Father.

I have had no earthly father because I was born by one but I didn't grow up with one. The only two episodes I can remember from the depression years of my Russian alcoholic father were not pleasant to remember. There was no influence, I had no benefit and when I saw the kinds of fathers that my other Jewish friends had I counted myself privileged.

Better to be without one than what they had to suffer. But so I grew up in a vacuum.

When it came time for spiritual birth I didn't know what Father meant.

I don't know that I'm sure now.

So I've never been comfortable to use the word Father and I don't know to what degree of loss has been paid for the want of that inability. And now remarkably I'm being looked upon here and there as a spiritual father. I guess it's because I'm getting gray or because there's such a conscious need of young believers for the kind of things that only a father can express. Authority, counsel, firm direction, reprimand, rebuke, chastisement.

They need that but who gives it?

Who will not be a soft touch and condescend and just say and do the kind of thing that is a blandishment and a condescension to the condition of that young man rather than a rebuke? A father's love is rare. A father's wisdom is rare. A father's requirement is rare. So there is such a profound need for fathers and even Paul says many pieces of a few fathers. But if we have not the father as prototype how shall we be father? I'm suffering right now two sons whose condition is abysmal, leaves much to be desired, are mainly the victims of my failure to be the father that I ought and was unable to convey because I had no intimate connection with the prototype of all fatherhood who is the father who is in heaven. And therefore we're taking this occasion to exhort the church and getting back to the fundamentals and to the foundations to establish this foundation or nothing else can be established after that. Nothing follows if we have not made this connection that has been lost and maybe for the same reason that I've lost it. There's a propensity in sons to exceed their fathers and to see themselves as even being superior in wisdom and understanding.

What is that joke about the son who is now the age of 21 or 31? All of a sudden he sees his father with new eyes. I didn't realize how wise you are.

Well it's only because now you've had a sufficient life experience to see how fatuous you were in your own presumption.

I've always been the same.

There's an egoistic, there's an issue of ego where the younger one wants to exalt himself at the price of the older and show himself even superior in judgment and in ability. I'm not saying this properly but we need to recognize this propensity in our humanity that probably keeps us from recognizing and honoring authority in the body and even impedes our acknowledgement with God as father is the desire to lift ourselves up. Have you noticed that there are certain ones who want to put a feather in their cap and see through a supposed authority and show just what kind of clay feet he in fact has and that he should not obtain the admiration that seems to come to him that others have granted without seeing as we have seen how vulnerable he is, how lacking he is because we have a more acute spirituality that we can see right through his pretense and blow the whistle on him in our superiority.

Have you seen that?

Who is free from the power of that egoistic gratification that can exalt itself at the expense of another who is older and in the position of authority and would distinguish you as being more uniquely discerning than anyone else? Because he's gotten away with it for years until you came on the scene and you saw through with your superior and exalted spirituality.

Got that?

That's why Chambers elsewhere says anything that you see that's deserving to be criticized is not given for your criticism is given for your intercession and in fact what authority that God has established in the earth and in the church has not clay feet, is not human all through human, is not shot through with contradictions, paradox, shortcomings and failings. The greatest of the patriarchs, every single one of them is a history of defect. David himself, the great king of Israel and the sweet singer of Israel was an adulterer and a murderer. It's as if God is saying you want to find fault?

You don't want to honor the authority?

Here's ample reason if you want to get off the hook so that you can exalt yourself at that expense.

But when you do so, you lose everything. You lose honor. You lose the recognition that I have established that king. I have set in this authority and you're not honoring me by finding it only as an object of your critique.

That great decision of David shows the heart of God. He revealed the heart of God by refraining himself from removing the greatest threat to his own life and to his own future kingdom and trusting God for his safety and his continuance without raising his own hand. That one decision was the issue of the kingdom and the revelation of God the Father.

That's what God is himself.

That's how God is self-deferring himself.

This is God.

David prostrated himself on his face and he called Saul, who was his intended murderer, my father. He gave Saul deference and honor totally undeserved in terms of his apostate conduct but wholly appropriate to his title and anointing given by God.

It wasn't a self-serving device.

It wasn't a salesman accommodating himself so it would do well for him. It was a deeply felt expression of honor that broke Saul's heart so Saul would say, you are more righteous than I and your kingdom will be the enduring kingdom.

So make note of that.

In that episode, go back and read it, David prostrates himself before Saul and cries out, my father, in a deeply felt and affectionate respect that was not artificial or counterfeit in order to serve his purpose in ingratiating himself to Saul so that if he butters him up that way, Saul in the future will not again persecute him. The fact of the matter is, Saul again persecuted him and David knew it, that this was not going to change the character of this apostate king. Nevertheless, he still honored him and that's what he brought into his kingdom and that's the kingdom that God is yet waiting to establish that can only be expressed through sons who have such a character, such an acknowledgement for authority and God's fatherhood that is yet lacking in the church because what is a son? A son is one who is passionate in his singular regard for the honor of his father and not his own. In fact, that honoring requires the forfeit of his own consideration. So a son is a remarkable phenomenon and here we are using the word so glibly and so loosely as if anyone could take it to himself who hasn't even begun to approach what sonship itself means as Jesus exemplified it in his own earthly walk and seeks to continue to do so. Now through us as the incarnate, risen and ascended son, but the understanding needs to come to us. We need to yield and desire this kind of sonship because as I tried to show you, the world is exactly the opposite.

It will not honor God. It will not defer to God.

It will displace God contentiously and arrogantly.

It doesn't believe that he can hear and that he can answer.

What's the point of calling upon God the Father?

It's just a ceremonial bleep. It doesn't amount to anything. There's not a God who's going to hear. There's not a Father who's all powerful, all righteous and all able. So we need to contend for this faith.

Seek it and believe that and begin to walk in it and express it also in the earthly prospects that are before us within the church itself and its authorities. What's appropriate for sonship is appropriate as much for women as believers as it is for men. Okay, I haven't gotten to this principle point of what justifies and gives us authority and enablement to use that invocation, my Father, to pray to God the Father. And Carl Barth here says, God himself being directly present as their Father in the demonstration of his nature and existence can neither be overlooked nor refuted. The question we have given is that the confrontation of these people with the reality and truth of God as their Father takes place as Jesus Christ enables, invites, and summons them to invoke him as such.

Let me underline that.

The Lord summons us to call upon God the Father.

We didn't coin this thought.

He said, pray to Father in my name. The disciples said, teach us how to pray. He said, here's how you pray. Our Father which art in heaven. So what God is directing us to, that the commission to call upon the Father has come from Jesus himself, the directive, but also the grace and the enablement is from Jesus. Jesus enables, invites, and summons them to invoke him as such. Obey to him as their Lord they came to be and are set in that unproblematical relationship to God the Father as they call upon him as such. According to the permission to command and order of Jesus Christ, God the Father in his nature and existence comes before them unmistakably and irrefutably.

This is Bart. This is the theologian. He's nailing it.

That this is not something that we pluck out of the air, that we decide we're going to begin to pray this way and make this honoring and this acknowledgement. This is part of the divine commission and the authority of Jesus that is given to those who have submitted to him as Lord. He's telling us to call upon God as Father. He's inviting us to summon the Father in prayer by calling on that name. And he's giving us the enablement and the grace so that it will not be a mechanical invocation, but one with an awareness of who the Father is. Because the enablement is not just to make the auditory sound Father, but to have the sense of who it is to whom you're calling.

Can you understand that?

The Lord himself is the provision to call upon God as Father. And if the Lord does not give that provision and invite us to employ it, it's not something that we can initiate and undertake of ourselves.

It would be presumption and preposterous. Got the idea?

Here's the beauty of a theologian who has wrestled with this deep loss of the fatherhood from the church and is probing and finding where we have gone amiss and failed to recognize and see. And what the connection is in our relationship with Jesus as the very key to the Father. And truly, no man can come to the Father or to him through the Father. No man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. There's a remarkable conjunction between Jesus and the Father that enables us to approach the Father because he has commissioned us, enabled us, invited us, even commanded us when you pray.

Pray this way. See what I mean?

So I appreciate this statement because it gives us a legal, how shall I say it, a justification, a right to make this call.

Otherwise it's presumption.

We need to be reminded that Jesus is bringing many sons to glory and he's establishing the quintessential constitutive elements that comprise sonship by himself being the example and by himself in his own authority commanding us and then joining us to call upon God the Father.

Because who else would know the Father better than he?

Who else can communicate what the Father is but one who has had an eternal courtship and relationship before he ever came into the earth? Who knows the Father better than Jesus and who the Father is and invites us to make that connection in his own authority and gives us the grace and the enablements that we do? See what a remarkable thing this is, what the Lord is doing for us to establish the foundational linkage with the Father that grants us an identity as sons. We need to dwell on the Lord's Prayer.

Maybe we'll do it.

Our Father, we're calling on him, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Your name and its honoring is the purpose of my call. I'm not calling for the expediency of needing this or that but my call has as its ultimate intention that your name should be hallowed. Because if your name is not hallowed, what then is there in the world and in the earth that will serve to mediate some grace into this otherwise grim thing that is called life?

If your name is not hallowed, what then is? What is holy? What is deserving of respect if your name is not hallowed?

So this is not a jealous deity desiring to be puffed up in his Godly egotism. For our sake, his name must be hallowed. So teach us how to pray.

Pray this way.

Our Father, which by the way means not just my Father, my individual God that serves me in my private and personal need, but the God with whom I share relationship with a body.

Our Father.

And God loves to hear that because he himself is triune.

He himself is composite. He himself is a sweet company. He himself is corporate.

So when he sees our reflection of our corporateness not as a begrudging necessity but as a delight and privilege by which we say our, he hears that.

And what's the purpose of our call? Hollywood be thy name.

Men becoming our God's children then by God's grace, which is his possibility and not theirs. This privilege and this call, which is the key to everything, is not presumptuously for us to take or to initiate.

It's a grace, a great grace. And it's by the goodness of the Father.

It is not originally intrinsic to them nor is it accessible to their own grasping and disposing. Rather it is freely intended for them and addressed and promised to them as the grace and goodness becomes a present event in their life and thought and action and suffering so that they acquire thereby the genuine freedom to cry Father.

Well this is recorded. Should I read that again?

It's a summation of all that the theologian is bringing us to consider of the privilege of calling upon God as Father is being summed up here. Men become and are God's children. Until we call on God the Father, how then are we rightfully children? We become children and sons in exact proportion as the acknowledgement and the ability to call upon God as Father.

No father, no sons. No father, no children.

See the two things are inextricably bound.

But how do you make the connection? You don't appoint it yourself. You don't express it yourself. It's not something we initiate for ourselves. That would be presumption. This is too holy. And so he goes on to explain.

It's by God's grace which is his possibility not theirs. He has chosen to give us this privilege not we ourselves to take it or to assume it. It's by the goodness of God the Father that even this privilege to call upon God the Father should enhance our respect, admiration and love for him that he gives us such a privilege. Because if we were any kind of God worth his weight, he ought to keep himself aloof from such as we are, not give us the right to come barging in to heaven and calling upon him.

He ought to retain his own integrity, keep at a distance.

That's why Jews are offended at the Gospel.

That this God came down to suffer and to die? No way. He's going to be born in the stable? No way. He's going to die outside to come out and cross for criminals? No way. That's not the God we know.

But the God that they know is not the God who's God.

This is God.

This is the grace of the Father to enable us to call upon him as children and as sons.

My God, where would we be without that? We'd be a bunch of dum-dums. We'd be staggering around in ignorance. We'd be walking into walls. We'd be doing injury to our own children.

In fact, as we are to the degree that we have not understood and appropriated this great distinction and blessing. Our children are the victims and the Church is the victim for the want of a fatherhood that comes to children who acknowledge the Father and recognize what a great grace it is that has been extended, that need not have been given.

Grace is not compelled. It's really given out of the very nature of the Father himself.

This is what the Father is in enabling us to call upon him. And that he's going to hear that call and he's going to answer that call, however choked and spluttering our prayer is, however inadequate, he's not going to weigh it in terms of our eloquence.

He will hear it.

I'll show you that later on and receive it and give us an answer exceedingly abundantly above what we think the praying to ask.

Or else where would we be?

We have not sufficiently esteemed the Father in the very grace of allowing us to call upon him with cognizance, respect, reverence and affection and what follows from that call. And yet the first miracle at the Gate Beautiful was in the holy name of the Child Jesus. And in today's Selection in Chambers he talks about the innocency of the Child Jesus. So there's something I don't want to rush by and ignore that somehow is a needful thing in the process of Sonship is the innocence of childhood and trust and purity of childhood that somehow is celebrated in Scripture.

And I don't understand it.

But Chambers now is a needful thing and the process of Sonship is the innocence of childhood and trust and purity of childhood that somehow is celebrated in Scripture.

And I don't understand it. But Chambers uses that reference and I'll read it here again.

If the Son of God is born into my mortal flesh, is his holy innocence and simplicity and oneness with the Father getting a chance to manifest itself in me? Maybe what he's saying is there's something about a child and his innocence that understands, loves and trusts the Father that we must not quickly pass by. And a certain quality of that innocence and trust must be in us to make that connection and give that respect so that we can go on to be Sons. I talked about the failure to give honor where honor is due, an authority. The other side of that coin is giving an honor where it is not due. Because I've seen in our charismatic generation that certain figures, because they are gray headed and look stately and give an outward affectation of maturity and fatherhood, are esteemed as fathers and are later on complete collapse in homosexuality, alcoholism for which they do not even repent when they are caught. So why was it that they were celebrated as fathers and even offered as an image to the body of Christ as a father?

Because they look like it.

What we think a father should look like. And we're very quick to latch on to the external and false replica of it.

How come?

Because we have not an inward and deep sense of the fatherhood of God that would immediately reveal the fraudulent counterfeit for what it in fact is. We would not be impressed with mere white hair for its own sake because it is not necessarily the statement of wisdom.

Could be. So why were we suckers to quickly latch ourselves on to these men?

Because we need a spiritual father, but they were not fathers in fact. They themselves were deficient in their own character. They had not themselves hunt the sonship, let alone the fatherhood, but they looked like it.

So what am I saying?

What saves us from being attracted and lifting such men up who do not deserve the acknowledgement is a deep inward sense of the mystery, for the want of a better word, of fatherhood as is contained in God the Father himself. When you have this unarticulated inward sense, it guards you from the counterfeit. And in fact the same sense alerts you to the real thing when it is available, however rare that is. So I'm making the case for an inward subjective sense of God as Father that does not come to us cheaply, but it comes to us from the frequency of the must relationship with him in devotion.

Got the idea? He's invisible, but he's a real person. He's a real father.

He has real qualities of character and disposition that we need to sense. And every time we come to him in the place of devotion, the early morning hours, some measure of that is being communicated even when we're not conscious of it. There's a residue of inward intuition that is coming into our inner man that is invaluable. So that when the phony thing makes its appearance, we're not at all impressed. When the real thing makes its appearance, we immediately identify.

But how do we get this sense of God? It's not cheap.

It's as often as you will call upon your Father who is in heaven in the early morning time when you do not come to him for a fix or you do not come out of a religious obligation.

I've got to put in so much prayer time and I've got to read so many chapters. This is a devotion. And you're starting from scratch and you're feeling the cold air, the draft on the floor, and you're feeling groggy and sleepy and you'd rather go back to bed.

You have no incentive to remain in that place of devotion, but that's where the action is. That's why Jesus rose early while it was yet dark and found a place apart to seek the Father, as Jim said, not to receive instructions for the day, to receive communion for the day. The sense of the Father, that inward presence, because the Father is reality, in a dear sense. The world is dying for the want of reality.

It's going askew.

It's spinning headlong into a grave, into a tumult of confusion and mayhem because of the lack of the sense of God as God, which is the principle of reality itself. This has got to be coveted, sought, and it waits for your invocation, my Father who art in heaven.

When have you prayed that last? When have you prayed that comfortably?

When have you prayed that with faith and received something of the sense of the Father who is God? We discussed the tent of Shem, and why is it that God so honors Shem, and that at the end, Japheth must dwell in the tent of Shem, and also Ham, because the tent of Shem is the repository of Godliness.

And why Shem? Because Shem covet his Father.

I would not look upon his naked disgrace, but walk backwards and covet him, so that nothing of the esteem or respect or affection for the Father was lost because of this momentary lapse of drunkenness.

Why?

Because Shem knew God and conferred to his earthly Father what was in his heart for the heavenly Father, and was to cover and not to expose. And so the tent of Shem, which is Israel's calling, is God's provision for all the Japheth world, and if it will not dwell in that tent, it will go about making war and doing its usual damage, because Japheth means expansion. It needs to be tempered by what is to be found in that tent alone by the Son who covered his Father in respect, and did not say, oh, now I'll rise to the head of the class.

My Father has had his shot. He's already, what, 500, 700 years old, and I'm young, and he's now disqualified himself. Let him languish in that condition. I'll now take over and be the superior Son. Nothing like that. It was a respect. It was an honoring.

It was a covering, and God the Father honored that, because that's the statement of God himself.

That's what God is.

What a test for the Church historically that a fallen Israel has constituted. How do we look upon God's ancient people in their drunkenness, in their orgies, in their fallenness, in their apostasy?

Do we brush them off? Do we look with contempt?

Well, they've had their chance and blown it, now we take over, which is so much the attitude of the present Church, or do we cover them? Do we remember that our fathers have come from them, the patriots, the apostles, prophets, and God will honor those fathers, and they're only temporarily fallen, as Paul has said. So we have an attitude of esteem which ought to be expressed to Jews presently, and if it had been expressed rather than the disdain and superiority of Christians, our relationship with the Jewish community would be different than other than what it presently is. They would be much closer to the Kingdom and much more amenable to hearing our message of the Lord if we had treated them with the respect and disposition that would be honoring even in their failing.

See what I mean? But what do we do when we see one fail? We rub our hands in glee.

There's something ironic about the Church, particularly in Slavic countries, that delights in fallen ministers.

Why? Because you're exalted at their expense.

Instead of sorrowing for the fallen one or covering him and being an instrument of restoration, they're quick to reject and to condemn.

So the Kingdom is yet listed. Just a final remark will take a break.

When do we hear the voice of the Father sounding from heaven and saying, this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased? It's when Jesus comes up out of the waters of Jordan. Why did the Father wait for that moment and the Spirit come down as a dove upon His head to abide? Because He came down and entered, in my opinion, the condition of the nation itself.

He identified with its sin. He identified with its shame. He didn't stay on the bank and look down and say, you suckers, you sinful, blah, blah, blah, blah.

He came down and joined and identified Himself with the plight of His people in a priestly way so that He could also raise them up out of their apostasy and unbelief into the place of God's intention for them as a royal nation, a nation of priests and a lighter to the world. When the Father saw that, He said, this is my beloved Son. Because when my Son did that, He revealed to me, when my Son humbled Himself, when He went down into the muddy waters, He was shown again His descent from heaven. He came down out of heaven in His privileged, pre-incarnate life into the earth.

Now He's coming down again.

Because coming down in humiliation and identification with the lost and the sinful is what I am as God.

This is my nature.

This is what I am as God the Father, and my Son has set me forth by His conduct. Without being instructed to do it, He just intuitively knew what is the right action in that moment as a Son. So Lord, may we know in the moments that come before us to show You forth in such a way, my God, as to win the attention and the astonishment of many who do not know God as God. So thank You, Lord, instruct our understanding.

You are the very prototype.

Jesus knew what to do, not because He had been detailed in instruction, but because He had been in communion with You. In the 30 years that preceded His earthly ministry, and everything flowed out of that knowledge of the Father because of the frequency of His communion with Him that made that action a natural and inevitable expression of God Himself. And Lord, we want to be sons like that, because not to be a son like that is not to be a son. And so there's no cheap and easy quickie, but You've ordained, You've summoned, You've given us authority to call upon God the Father in more than just a mechanical gesture, but in a reverential and affectionate way. And then we might glean in that call something of the sense of Him and express it, Lord, as the occasions are given.

Thank You so far for this morning.

Give us an opportunity to catch our breath, to inwardly take this in, to digest, to let it have its working and to find its expression, Lord, because this is not just an academic luxury. You're wanting something wrought in Your people who are being called as many sons unto glory, in Jesus' name.

Amen.
