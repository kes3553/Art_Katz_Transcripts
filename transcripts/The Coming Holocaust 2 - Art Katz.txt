The Coming Holocaust 2 - Art Katz

Good morning saints. I'm required to bring you into my mood. A little different from your own as you have expressed it so far. But the mood appropriate to the word, which is quite sober, if not mournful, because I am required to put before you a perspective this morning.

Which is tragic before it becomes joyous, the last days dealings of God with the people Israel, not just the nation per se, but the Jacob people that are in the earth everywhere.

A final uprooting and a sifting throughout all nations, a calamity that will exceed the Nazi time. That will be an astonishment merely to report, let alone to live through. So this will make a requirement of you. Just to have the mental stature to hear this. And a moral stature to bear it. A spiritual stature to participate in it.

For the church will not be absent from the earth during this time of tribulation.

Despite our fondest hope for escape.

If there will be no church in the earth, there will be no Jewish survival. For your destiny is to be God's salvific agency toward them.

It's a frightening perspective that compels the church to be the church.

So that Jacob can become Israel and fill the earth with their fruit. So blessing all the nations when they shall know the Lord who has spoken and will perform this.

This is called an apocalyptic scenario. Last day's judgment. The uprooting through the nations.

Who will have a last opportunity to perceive in God's dealing with Israel, God himself.

Because in the prophets it speaks, I will set a standard before the nations. I will put a sign before them.

It will be the display of himself, invisible judgment against Israel.

As well as the supernatural mercy that will restore and return them.

So when you encompass God from judgment to mercy, you have God in his totality.

Which has always been Israel's destiny to exhibit. My witness nation.

Not so much by our virtue, so much as our fall. For how else shall God's mercy be exhibited?

Except as the alternative and remedy for judgment. No judgment, no mercy.

And mercy is for the undeserving.

Not something that we merit because of our virtue. But all the more desperately need because we have no virtue. I'm sorry to disappoint you in all of this. Because you thought that we Jews had special virtue.

The mystique of Israel.

You have missed the point entirely. It's not that we exceed what is human. But we are all the more human. Only human. And full of the presumption of what is in man.

We, unaided, without the necessity for God, can establish our own state. God is making a final statement to all mankind through Israel. You need to see Israel in the cosmic context of God's purposes for creation.

That in man is no good thing at all.

If God were to mark iniquity, who can stand?

Israel is that statement.

For the edification of all mankind.

Millennially and eternally. As well as for its own understanding.

Who will name Jerusalem the city of God's righteousness. God, our righteousness.

And not our own Jewish virtue. At its best piety. Most superb religious form.

Crucified the Lord of Glory. This is the statement of the crucifixion.

The best of Roman law. The best of secular civilization. Lexis Romanus, the Roman law.

And Jewish piety. The exquisite Judaism of God.

Conspired together.

To crucify the Lord of Glory. For neither in Rome nor in Israel.

Is there any virtue. But in God alone. So Lord, as we prayed last night for mercy. And you gave it. Gave it remarkably. And no one knows it better than I. So depleted. So physically crunched. So much overweighted by the oppression that prevails in this city and nation. That is so anti-Christ in its essential spirit.

And despises the prophetic man and his message.

And all of that. And the weariness of yesterday. And all of our muddled thought. And not knowing how to speak. And having no ability in ourselves. Or strength or wisdom. You prevailed.

Because we prophetic men are called not only to pronounce, but to do. But to demonstrate the truth of our word.

If we received anything last night. And I believe we received much. More than you can even estimate.

We received it because of the faithfulness of the Holy Spirit. We received it because of the faithfulness of the covenant making and keeping God. Which covenant I daily renew and celebrate.

Even this morning. While you were yet sleeping. I was enjoying the covenantal meal.

The sacrament of the bread and the wine.

Feeding the inner man. Out of the substance and spirit of his body and blood. And out of that strength.

In the confirmation and the renewed validation of covenant.

I am speaking to you this morning. And spoke to you yesterday. And will speak in Nuremberg tomorrow. And Munich after that. In Frankfurt area. Zurich Switzerland. Israel. Day after day. Night after night. Not just to perform.

But to bring the word of God.

The appointed word. Beyond any ability in man to himself form or comprehend. Out of his indestructible life. That the same means by which the word has come to you. Will be the means whereby you fulfill it.

So that we can all say together with the apostle Paul. Who is sufficient for these things?

You have not yet made that cry.

Because the apostolic requirement has not yet been fulfilled. Because the apostolic requirement has not yet been made clear for you.

And the day that it will.

In your mandate to the Jew. In all the historic enmity against the gospel. In every way that history has poisoned the name of Jesus for their consideration.

Yet your requirement to call them to that way. Is beyond any possibility in your personal power. You know what you're going to have to say with me?

For us to live is Christ.

So don't be impressed with the man. So don't be impressed with the man. So don't be impressed with the man. So don't be impressed with the man. What a pitiful shambles. Weakness itself. The merest dust. The least of all saints.

To whom this grace is given. To make known the inestimable riches in Christ. And the mysteries of the faith. Israel and the church.

Not as we have romantically and idealistically thought it. Not as we have romantically and idealistically thought it.

But as it has been given apostolicly to understand and to fulfill it. Only on the basis of covenant faithfulness. Only on the basis of covenant faithfulness. For the circumcised of God.

Obtained at the cross. Through baptism.

That he might be made a God unto us.

That in his strength. In his moral stature. We can fulfill our call and our destiny. To the everlasting praise of his glory. To the everlasting praise of his glory.

For as the apostle himself tells us at the conclusion of his mystery. For as the apostle himself tells us at the conclusion of his mystery. For of him and through him and through him and to him are all things. For of him and through him and to him are all things.

What you are going to hear today. This last day scenario is not of me. This last day scenario is not of me. It's of him. And it's only fulfillment will be through him. And it's only fulfillment will be through him.

That to him and to him alone be all glory. That to him and to him alone be all glory.

Now and for ever. Now and for ever. Mamma Mia!

We are called to the fulfillment of his glory. We are called to the fulfillment of his glory.

In time and history. In time and history. But the magnitude of it is so great. But the magnitude of it is so great. That it will become his glory forever. That it will become his glory forever. Your participants in his eternal glory. Your participants in his eternal glory.

And who is sufficient for these things?

This Germany that failed so tragically.

Whose Christianity was so inept.

So formalistic even in its piety. So formalistic even in its piety. I can't find the word. So thin. So... So Lutheranish. That it could not foresee the evil that would come. And invited that evil.

To fulfill the spiritual vacuum of Germany. Which could only have been fulfilled apostolicly.

And not in a Christianity that had become only a Sunday addendum. A burgerlish requirement. What one can then bring in harmony with the entire financial interests. What one can then bring in harmony with the entire financial interests. And with the imperial ambitions of an entire nation. You can not make Jesus an accessory to your ambition. You can not make Jesus an accessory to your ambition. And your bourgeois lifestyle. Without inviting the spirit of evil. To fulfill such a vacuum. And to fulfill its passion.

To destroy the Jew in your midst.

Whom you did not save. And could not save. By your antiseptic Christianity. Which was the Sunday equivalent of their Saturday Judaism. You both conspired against God.

And the Holocaust was His judgment upon us both.

And will come again. If the conditions are not altered. And the spiritual vacuum remains. For the dark powers that fill the invisible space. For the dark powers that fill the invisible space. In the air over the nation remain. Waiting their next opportunity. To complete what had been left uncompleted by their failure in the war. To complete what had been left uncompleted by their failure in the war. Their only deterrent is the church. But a church of what kind? Ultimate kind. Apostolic kind.

In the house that is the house of sacrifice. In the house that is the house of sacrifice.

And not enjoyment. I hadn't planned to say any of these things. But what have my plans to do with anything? I'm beside myself. For your sake and for his sake. And naively trust that whatever issues from me. Has its origin from the throne. Pray for me. I naively believe that. In every place. No matter if it is in Uganda or Kenya. Or ten cities in Ukraine. Or in London. No matter where and when. I see myself as a sent word. From a sending body. Which I trust you'll receive. And become the very reality corporately.

That the Lord is setting before you. Not only by word but by example. That we might all together be the children of the covenant. The sons and daughters of Zion. Out of which Israel's deliverance comes alone. The children of Zion.

Which is much more than respectable German Christianity. Even with its charismatic dimensions. In fact, ironically.

Our charismatic dimensions might be the greatest obstacle to the obtainment of the apostolic reality. And that is why I believe that the Lord is setting before you. And the Lord is setting before you.

Think on what that means. And what kind of death at the cross that will require. As I listened to the youthful announcements this morning. Of the kind that I myself once expressed.

And I believe that the Lord is setting before you.

And felt melancholy.

Maybe the Lord allowing the excitement and anticipation. That precedes the death of it and the resurrection.

But I don't know. I'm just speaking like the fool. Beyond my own comprehension. Mysteries. For you to consider. All that is introduction. What then of the message? So turn with us to Jeremiah chapter 16. And we'll begin our little scriptural overview. And then we begin our little biblical overview.

Of the last days for Israel and the church. The end times for Israel and the community of Jesus.

For which message I am persona non grata. Unwelcome. Rejected. Perhaps even despised. Not so much from the nation Israel.

As the messianic congregations within it.

Who don't want to consider. A devastation and ruin. A devastation and ruin. And an expulsion out from the nation again. As they have said to me. If that's true. What about our ministry? Oh yeah. For your ministry.

God is going to alter his apocalyptic intention.

For your ministry.

God is going to alter his apocalyptic intention. Alone by which Israel shall learn its God.

And the nations also. And the nations also. Where nothing less will suffice.

To communicate the knowledge of God as God.

But as God. As he in fact is. And not as men think him to be. Either Talmudically. Either Talmudically. Or charismatically.

We are all of us falling short of the glory of God.

And we don't know as we ought to know. And we don't know as we ought to know.

And judgment is the great teacher. And judgment is the great teacher. Whether at the crucifixion of Jesus. Or the crucifixion of Israel. Or the crucifixion of Israel.

We are at that threshold. A nation established not to succeed. A nation established not to succeed. But to perish.

That the Lord might say to us as he said to his disciples.

In our terrible disappointment. In our terrible disappointment. For what we had romantically and idealistically hoped. For what we had romantically and idealistically hoped.

Israel's success. The success of Israel.

On the same basis as our success. On the same basis as our success. By what is in man and himself.

That the Lord will say to us as before. O fools and slow of heart to believe. All that the prophets have spoken. Ought not Israel to suffer and to die.

Before it rises to its glory.

Ought not Israel to suffer and to die.

Before it rises to its glory.

Ought not Israel to suffer and to die.

Before it rises to its glory. That there is a suffering that precedes a glory. Your problem was unlike Paul. Was to only believe for success.

While Paul believed for the glory of God forever. That glory for Israel.

For Jesus. For the church. Must necessarily be preceded by a suffering and a death.

If the Lord of glory was not exempted from that requirement.

Shall the nation? Shall the church? So in Jeremiah chapter 16. And we have to go quickly through these scriptures. Omitting whole sections and verses that you should be studying. But for our purposes this morning.

Where the Lord says in verse 12 you have done worse than your fathers. Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that you don't know in verse 13.

Which raises the question. Where did you do worse than your fathers? In the land from which I will cast you out. Because you shall be witness unto me. And not to your Zionist power or ability.

Which the church wants so much to see succeed. Because it does not have the apostolic criterion.

But shares the worlds model. Satisfied only with success. Rather than glory. I will cast you out of the land. Which I believe is future. And require an establishment in the land. Or else how shall there be a casting out? And in verse 15.

That the Lord himself then will bring them back from all the lands where he has driven them.

Implying expulsion through force and violence. Where I have driven them. I will bring them back. Not that they will bring themselves back. That's a Jacob activity. Of stretching forth your own hand to grasp and to obtain. I will bring them back. And I will bring them back so visibly before the face of all nations. From the remotest places where I will have driven them. That the nations will observe my judgment in their expulsion. And my mercy in their return.

That they might know that I alone am God.

Will he go that far? For the nations sake? As well as his own? Yes. He who did not withhold his only begotten son. He who did not withhold his only begotten son.

In such devastation and brutality as you will see in this film. Will equally not withhold his nation.

Also his firstborn son. For the devastation that must befall them. And if you do not realistically and biblically expect this. Having put iron in your soul. That underlies all of your worshipful and joyous activity. That underlies all of your worshipful and joyous activity. Or it makes a mock of God. As if you are rejoicing for that which is already accomplished. And have no consciousness.

For the suffering that must proceed to glory.

That should be the undertone of your deepest joy. That should be the undertone of your deepest joy. Or your joy is a false note. And the powers of darkness know it. Who have only one requirement to observe. That which is authentic. And Jesus they know.

The man of sorrows.

And of grief. And Paul they know.

In his apostolic suffering and sacrifice.

But the church of Berlin who? Who? Who acknowledges you. For so much is predicated on your own enjoyment. And the success of your programs. And you have not his glory at the apex and center of your being. So you are not on apostolic ground. And constitute no threat to those powers of darkness. Who mock the church. And make Berlin a zoo. And make Berlin a zoo. Populated by zombies. Who love nakedness and flesh and sensuality. Who wallow in it. And have homosexuals for their mayors.

And all that God abhors.

Germany celebrates.

All that God abhors.

While the church sleeps. And enjoys its choruses. Verstehen Sie? You follow me? That's why I said I could not enter your mood this morning. You're obliged to enter mine. Because it's not some old man's eccentric disposition.

It's the disposition of the Lord.

His mood.

Because my continual prayer before him is not only give me your word but give me the disposition of your soul, your mood, your temperament.

Because the wrong mood can make even the word a lie. So we read here, if I can find it, that you will no more talk about your temperament.

You will no more talk about Egypt who has brought you out of the land of Egypt. In verse 14, it shall no more be said. It shall no more be said?

This is our defining experience as Israel.

The God that brought us out of Egypt.

Through Moses. To Sinai. To the law.

To the land of promise. That shall no more be said of God?

Means something greater shall come?

That shall eclipse even that first exodus?

The greatest historic episode of our national history? That something is yet to come?

That will eclipse that exodus?

A second exodus? And of that we will millennially and eternally speak?

Not of the God that brought us out of Egypt but out of all the lands in verse 15 where he has driven them.

All the lands where he has driven them. So you can pray for me. I'm speaking this in every land. Egypt itself.

Where Jews will be driven as the Lord gave me vision to see while in Cairo.

And a word that the charismatic Egyptian Christians would not receive. And a word that the charismatic Egyptian Christians would not receive. And gave me back the cassettes that they should not be circulated. So I sat there at the end of the last night. Pathetic piece of humanity. Trained. Failed. They did not believe the word. Of course they did not want to believe the word.

That God has a destiny for Israel.

That will be fulfilled after their expulsion and return.

And gives obligation to the church of every nation.

To take them in when they are in flight from persecution. From relentless Islamic hatred. That will not be satisfied with their defeat. But their degradation and their humiliation. Their extermination. Off the face of the earth. The same spirit that animated Nazism. Which was relentless till the last day of the war. And stupefied the military historians to this day. Why did the German authorities continue to send material and manpower for the extermination of the Jew while their back was to the wall for their own survival. Because they were driven.

In the hatred against the Jew.

That will not be satisfied with anything less than their extermination. Which is the same spirit that animated Islam. Which evil spirit remains.

And will now animate Islam.

As it once animated Germany. And perhaps yet will again. Why is Satan so determined to exterminate the Jews?

So that there will be no return of the redeemed of the Lord to Zion. Because they know better than the church that the Lord is contained in the heavens. Waiting for the restoration of all things spoken by the prophets since the world began.

You will not see me again. You will not see me again.

Until you shall say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. The Lord is waiting for something from a restored nation.

Or that remnant of them that will survive.

And constitute the redeemed of the Lord who return to Zion.

Though they did not leave it in that condition.

They have returned as the redeemed of the Lord.

Because something has happened to them. From the time of their expulsion to the time of their return. As I will show you in the scriptures today. I will sift you through all nations. And there I will meet with you face to face. And bring you under the rod of my authority. And into the bond of my covenant. For I will rule over you. For I will rule over you. For I will rule over you.

There is an encounter that shall take place in the wilderness of the nations.

And that wilderness can be right here in Berlin. A wilderness within the city, within the nation.

Another kind of environment where the uttermost reality of God is to be found.

In a people who have allowed themselves to be stripped. And have taken their strippings with joy. And have taken their strippings with joy.

How does God form a prophet?

I wish I could tell you. Because it's your destiny also. It's formed in the hidden place that is not visible to others. Within the context of your present life. Because you have invited and allowed the Lord. He will bring you into the wilderness place. Where you are stripped of all false confidences. And God will bring them through your wilderness. Where they will meet with him face to face. Through your German faces. And black. And black. And every variety of believer. And they will see the same consistent reality.

The love of God.

Expressed in mercy. Unconditionally. No matter how offensive they are. No matter how ungrateful. No matter how abusive. Your love will be unconditional. At a time when to express it is to invite your own peril. You think those Muslims will leave you alone?

If you are extending mercy to the Jews?

To preserve them? And to save them? Your identification with them. Into whose tree you have been grafted.

Will make them your brethren as they are the Lord's. So when he asks in that day, what did you do for the least of these, my brethren?

You will have done much.

For which he will say, enter, you righteous, into the kingdom prepared for you. For the issue of the Jew is the issue of the church. The church that does not count its life as dear unto itself.

And will extend it for another. Even his brethren in their unsaved condition, terrified and demoralized and unkempt. It will not offend your German sensibility. You will love them unconditionally. Because you have risen above mere sentimentality. Which I have so much love to enjoy.

To the unconditional love of God.

To your covenant bonding with him. Obtained last night in circumcision. That you will test the truth of it. Whether you came in sincerity. Or you only came. We are on our first text, our first verse. So to be continued. And even then to pray. And then we must also pray.

May the Lord spread the fundamental perspectives before us.

Which are worth it, that we should hold detailed seminars about it.

May the God who will birth a nation in one day, birth a church in a night.

From charismatic to apostolic.

In one hearing of the mystery of Israel. The one subject that alone has the potential in the wisdom of God. Not only to save the redeemed of the Lord. But to establish the church for his name. For the church that is ignorant of this destiny. Who does not welcome this obligation, this mandate will not be the apostolic church.

More likely the apostate. For those are the only two options. At the end of days.

And the issue of the Jew will be decisive.

We want to thank the Lord. For this remarkable statement. I am overwhelmed at the breadth of what God has already breathed into us. And must complete tonight. That the foundation would be laid. Immovably. That will affect all our future. Let's pray together now.

Lord, who is sufficient for these things? That the very report of that foundation that the very report of that last day's scenario is more than men can bear.

It's an astonishment.

That we're called not just to understand it, but to perform it.

Lord, we're just like your speaker. We're just like your speaker. We're just like your speaker. We're dust. Full of frailty. Incapable of bringing your judgment even to our own households. Soft and indulgent. We don't know the sternness of your fatherhood. Or the requirement of your righteousness. And our very motives are corrupt. And our very motives are corrupt. Satisfied only with success. Satisfied only with success. And have not the faith to believe for nor desire your glory. And have not the faith to see your glorification.

But Lord, if you cannot succeed with us, where will you succeed? We are so representative of the church and the church at its best.

And you have already invested much in us. Through the remarkable pastor you have given. Who has not spared us with the truth. And has been willing to invite this man. Where many doors are closed. He welcomes us. And the radical word. So bless this people Lord. Whom you have prepared for this hearing. That they might even say, everything till now has been preparation. But speak Lord. Let not a word fall to the floor. Give us the full measure of your heart for this time. For your servants are hearing. Thank you Lord. For the days that have proceeded this morning. A line upon line, a pre-step upon pre-step. And now this morning's statement so utterly rare. So seldom heard anywhere. You have spoken with such conciseness and gravity. Such breadth and sweep. We invite you to continue and ventilate your entire heart. And we will hold on to your word. We will speak often one to another in the consideration of it. We will hear the tape again and again. We will study the texts until the word is internalized in us. That it might be made flesh. Thank you Lord. Speak Lord. Give us the full measure. Bring us back with expect and sing.

And physical and moral strength to hear and receive the burden of the Lord. Receive our gratitude and our privilege for such speaking such visitation such a call such a mandate which we receive with rejoicing in Jesus' name.

Amen. Lord here we are again. Again and again we come before you. Our hearts are earnest. We want so much to be real for your sake. And our coming this morning is a statement to you and an announcement to the powers of the air. We are willing for your stripping. Yes you know how to do it. Right within the context of our present circumstance. In marriage, in job and employment in health and body. You know how to deal with us. You know how to fit and prepare us. You bring many sons to glory.

Prophetic men and women. Not that will give cheap and glib prophecies that are more human than they are divine.

But they have the prophetic mind. They have the apostolic mindset. They live for one thing only. Whatever the cost. Shame, humiliation. Misunderstanding. Even from other Christians. Even death itself. Even from Jews. Who do misunderstand us. As they did Stephen. And threw him in the air. As they did Stephen. And threw him in the ignorance.

As they slew also their messiah. May make of us martyrs.

Even at their hands. Whatever it is. Our every hair is numbered. And we stand before you this morning.

In the most solemn consecration.

To be your people. Your covenant people. Fulfilling your mandate.

The most difficult that could be given to the church. The restoration of Israel. The salvation of the lost sheep of your house.

By demonstrating to them. Their very God. That they shall see him in us. Not in the moment of our convenience. But in the moment of our extremity. Instead of exhibiting fear. For our earthly life. Our material possessions. We will count it all joy. To be stripped to suffer. Even and especially for their sake. While they are being hated all the world over. They are being loved by us. With costly love. In the place where they least expect to find it.

Among Gentiles.

Christians. In Germany. Seal this Lord. Seal this great mystery. Put flame in our hearts. At the so great calling. Beyond any ability in ourselves to perform.

If there is no resurrection. We of all men are most to be pitied. But we know that there is a resurrection.

And you have even exhibited us before us these last few days. Through a 75 year old man. Who has every reason to be exhausted and spent. And seems to increase in strength. Even as he fulfills in obedience. His call to us in these days. And you have even exhibited us before us these last few days. May we fulfill our call. On the same basis by which he fulfills his. For there is no other basis. But the power of the risen and ascended life.

The light that lightens the Gentiles.

The light of his life.

Is the glory of the people Israel.

And you have determined in your wisdom. That they shall see it through our faces. In the very hour of crisis and extremity. Or they shall not see it at all. Lord this is beyond any one of us individually. Lord this is beyond any one of us individually.

We have now requirement to be the church.

This is a corporate glory. Possible only in a body. Of authentically related individuals. Of authentically related individuals. Who have died to their individuality. That they might be the members of a body. A body have you desired. And a body you will have. Diverse in age and sex. Gender. Race. Drawn from the whole variety of mankind in Germany. Drawn from the whole variety of mankind in Germany. But one as you are one. Not by magic. By the cross. So Lord I bless them.

As the minister sent unto them.

Whatever measure of authority I have in your sight. Whatever measure of authority I have in your sight. I bless this people. I bless this pastor.

I bless the elders those who are in a place of responsibility.

That they might all come. Into the fullness and stature. Of the perfect man. The perfect man. The overcoming Christ. The overcoming figure. In stature, wisdom and love. Put the love for the Jew in their hearts. Not the schmaltzy sentimental false equivalent. The true love. Your own. And that cannot be offended against. It cannot fail. Even when it is tested.

As only the Jew knows how to test.

And which we have failed. Even Luther has failed. But we must not.

The unconditional love of God.

Which has replaced our shabby substitute. Romantic affinity for Israel. Which we had self interest and investment. And it was not priestly. Come and bring the death. Here at this altar. The place of sacrifice. Every substitute. For the real thing. And have a people for your name. Who know you as you in fact are. And are not ashamed that you are a God of judgment. For when your judgments are in the earth.

The world will learn righteousness.

And know that equally. That it is mercy that follows judgment. Which you will express through them.

Or there will be no Jewish survival at all.

That by our mercy, they will obtain mercy. And you will be glorified. As their king.

When the redeemed of the Lord return to Zion. Through the sacrifice of the church. Through the sacrifice of the church.

That in fact is the church. Bless this people. For the so high call. Whatever the cost. You are free to wake us out of our bed at any time of night. The early morning hours. You don't have to gratify our German minds. To give us explanation of why. But let your spirit have full sway.

In groanings that cannot be uttered.

That opens the very heavens. Yes, even over this Berlin. Over this Germany. Over this people in Germany. Over this Germany. Over this people in Israel. That you might come down. And be revealed. Bless these children. Seal them with divine sealing. In a once and for all way. That needs not again to be repeated. But sealed. In heaven. By name. Everyone whom you know. And have called. In these days. In this hour. For Jesus sake.

In whose name we pray.
