Ezekiel 37 The Death of Humanism - Art Katz

It's a textus classicus, a classic text.

It is the classic text of the mystery of Israel and the Church. And it probably is the source from which Paul drew his inspiration for what we discussed last night in Romans 11, where three times he shows that the issue of Israel's restoration at the end of the days is not the issue of Israel.

Israel is going to be inert, out, down and out. Something has to happen to it, from outside it.

And the factor that the Lord employs is the Church. That by your mercy they may obtain mercy. They stumble, they fall, but through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to move them to jealousy. So we have two instances now of the role of the Church toward Israel. And the third was when the fullness of the Gentiles become in, so all Israel shall be saved. As it is written, the deliverer shall come out from Zion. Well, that's the function of the Church, that the fullness of the Gentiles become in. And now the Lord gives the essential impetus and incentive for that outreach into the world, that when it's completed, the Lord then turns to Israel in her hapless condition and becomes her deliverer. When we see this theme repeated in the Old Testament, we can suspect this is where Paul drew his inspiration to understand what the Church represents. That through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to move them to gentile. That through your mercy they may obtain mercy.

He keeps going back to show that the key to Israel is not Israel herself.

She will not deserve, she will not justify, she will not be in any place to affect her own restoration.

She must necessarily be down and out.

And I'll give a cigar or something to the one person here in the congregation who can tell us why Israel must necessarily be down and out. That this is not an inadvertent thing or a circumstantial thing, a necessary thing in the stratagem of God who is dealing with Israel in view of all the nations.

Israel is his witness nation.

Israel is the personification of man, the statement of humanism, of hubris, pride, self-exaltation, self-sufficiency. What other people can take a malarial wasteland and in half a century make a modern day state with the world's greatest military powers, with nuclear capability, and all the kinds of things that these Jews have done in that part of the world. They are a statement of man, exemplary man thinking to succeed independently of God. There's a moral statement that God must make to the world through Israel as a demonstration nation of what his wisdom and desire is for all men everywhere. The Jew is man personified. He is the summation of all that can be attributed to man in his opposition to God who wants to be as God. Therefore the dealings of God are so severe, both in judgment and in mercy, to reveal God more clearly and reveal the nature of man more powerfully.

That takes place equally at the cross.

We see God in righteousness and mercy, and we see man in the condition of his sin revealed in what is required by God to expiate it. So the judgment that came on Jesus is a statement of God's righteousness and his wrath and indignation against sin, which we would never have understood to be exceedingly sinful until we see what it requires to expiate it.

You got that?

Likewise, we can't fathom and understand the nature of man that gives the demonic power such opportunity through pride and self-exaltation to oppose God, except in the judgment that comes, reveals both the nature of the man judged and the righteousness of the God who judges. But the capstone is God does not end with judgment.

He ends with mercy. What is mercy?

Mercy is the undeserved grace that is given independent of any qualification or any deserving. It's not what Israel is by which he obtains mercy. It's what God is. So the final act of God toward Israel is the statement of God as God. These are just basic fundamental assertions that need to be understood in the great mystery of Israel and the Church, of which Paul told us last night, I would not have you to be ignorant or you will suffer such and such a consequence. It's so great a design of God.

It concludes the age. It began the age. It concludes the age.

It's the consummation of all things. It's the coming of his kingdom, which is a Davidic kingdom promised in covenant to that people, and that its king will be out from its loins, loins of David qualified to sit on his throne out of Zion, the singular place that God has chosen because he's a God who chooses, which would not have been our choice.

But he's strange that way. He likes the weak and the people of no repute, and that's why I'm here.

And last night as I was here was in the worst and least condition that I can remember in recent memory, totally reduced, to give the Lord the greater opportunity not only to express but to demonstrate the remarkable mystery into which we are called, not just to enjoy it or to be able to speak of it, but to participate in its consummation.

What privilege! And we'll be doing it in our weakness, not in our strength. I can tell you this.

When the crisis moment comes, when God will require something from you in the fulfillment of this mystery, as it is expressed in your own locality with the Jew, you are not going to feel like it. He'll not choose your most spiritual moment when you're ready to go. He'll choose that moment when you are deflated, when you have no sense of capability, when you would rather run the other way.

I know it. My experience frequently, it will be yours.

So if you are a hyper-spiritual type who will not act unless you feel the moving of God and the choice moment and you're all ready and prepared, you'll have missed it.

Read today's selection from Oswald Chambers, which I brought with me, and I don't know if I'll read it, but you should have your own copy of Oswald Chambers with you. Wasn't that true?

He says, if you're that kind of spiritual prima donna that waits for the lofty feeling and moment in which to perform for God, forget it. He's not going to give you that kind of satisfaction. When he calls you, you'll be deflated, so that if anything issues from you, it has got to be God, who alone is to be glorified and not your spirituality. This issue comes up in our text for today, Ezekiel 37.

Let's take a look at that. The classicus textus, the valley of dry bones. That begins, not with the reference to the bones, and why bones? Because they're inert. Bones are helpless, bones are desiccated, bones are dried out. Bones have no capability.

It's the final statement of the ultimate reduction of man in death. And we never did answer the question, why must Jews, why must Israel be brought to this low estate, this condition of absolute helplessness, that if anything happens to it, it must come to it from outside?

Why?

Because the Jew is the statement of human self-sufficiency, human arrogance and conceit, made in God's image but not giving him credit, usurping and taking to itself as if it had made itself. So God has got to make a statement.

That's a no-no. And here's what the end of this hubris, H-U-B-R-I-S, the Greek word for pride, presumption. The last statement is, a valley of dry bones.

Right now, even as I speak, Israel, and I'm not just speaking about the political entity in the Middle East, Israel is that all-inclusive statement of that nation, wheresoever it exists, and has been proliferated in the earth. Israel, of course, the political nation, no doubt, unquestionably, but everywhere, is in process of death. The dry bones are not the statement of the Holocaust, because, as we'll see from the text, it's an indication of a yet future state, a future condition, which is already present and working in the press that is coming upon the state, and Jews everywhere beginning to see the pall of anti-Semitism rising up like a dark menace over the face of the earth, and in places of the earth where Jews have enjoyed. Untroubled security and affluence are now becoming places of fear and threat, as I've already mentioned, where leaders are beginning to suggest, don't go out in the street recognizably as a Jew. You're inviting a beating, and, in fact, the state has, the French government has told the Jewish community, we're not in a position to protect you against five to ten million Muslims.

And so they're talking about packing your bag, learning a new language, and being prepared to move.

But where will you move if this blight, this vicious, demonic phenomenon, is being revived from the Middle Ages about poisoning whales and using gentile blood to make their liturgical ceremonial things like matzah? Who could ever believe that in modern times these old wives' tales can be revived and be a basis for contempt against the Jew, not from the people in the gutter only, but people at the highest levels of life. Universities, labor unions, the peace movements, have come into a new confederation of an alignment that they're unified on one basis, they're antagonism against the Jew, not Israel only, not Zionism only, that's how it began, but now the Jew, and not the Jew only in Israel, but the Jew anywhere and everywhere.

You need to be aware of what is happening globally.

The Jewish community is frightened, and rightly so for the increase of the incidents of anti-Semitic episodes.

Swastikas, gravestones being toppled, schools being bombed, fires, beatings, it's the beginning of the time of Jacob's trouble. The end thereof will be a nation reduced. When did this text come to me and the way that I'll convey it this morning? With the first stones that were thrown at the Intifada, the first Intifada, when children threw stones at Israeli soldiers, something in my inner man said, this is the beginning of the end.

This innocuous, relatively harmless thing with stones will set in motion the whole chain of events by which the nation and the people with it will be brought down, must necessarily be brought down, so that they might be brought up. They will be a base that they might be extolled and become central to all nations.

Let's look at the text.

The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo, they were very dry. And he said unto me, son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, Lord God, thou knowest. And again he said unto me, prophesy upon these bones and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones, behold, I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live. I will lay sinners upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord. The essential requirement if Israel is to be a nation of priests and the light of the world is this knowledge and you will know.

Not rabbinically, not Talmudically, not academically.

You will know with that knowledge which is knowledge by experiencing God as God.

You will know. You were down and out. You were flat out. You were as good as dead. You had no life in you.

When I revive you, you will know that it is I who am alone God.

I am the Lord.

So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied there was a noise, a shaking, the bones came together bound to his bone and when I beheld low the sinners and the flesh came up upon them.

The skin covered them above but there was no breath in them. The vital ingredient is yet lacking, yet wanting.

And he said unto me, prophesy unto the wind, unto the breath, what's the word in Hebrew?

The ruach.

Prophesy to the ruach and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain that they may live, showing that their condition is not from old age but a violent death. So I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived. They stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army. And then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, our bones are dried, our hope is lost, we are cut off for our parts. Therefore, prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, behold, O my people, I will open your graves, cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel.

Note that this phenomenon of wholesale death through violence being slain takes place in the nations.

The death and resurrection of Israel is a phenomenon in the nations and then the resurrected are brought back to the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land. Not what you did in placing yourself, not your Zionist activity which had for a historical moment a hope of success and was an inspiration even to the Christian church who rooted for you and wanted to see you so much to succeed in your own establishment of your own state by your own endeavor, by your own effort, by your own expertise, by your own wealth, by your own political ability. Of course, it was under the providence of God, but it was essentially your act.

It had to be, because it has to fail.

I'm going to show you historically and millenially what the difference is when you as man seek to attempt something that only God can perform that must in the end have a consequence of death. This is instruction for all of us, dear saints, our ministries, families, anything that issues from us our own humanity the end thereof is death, failure. God will only prosper what pertains to His glory, which is always the issue of a resurrection out of death. Why is it, okay, this is good, why is it that the charismatic evangelical church sympathetic to Israel are rooting for the success of the nation?

And why are they opposed to my view?

My own Jewish kinsmen in Israel, I'm persona non grata, not by the state, but by the messianic congregations.

They don't like this message. I spoke to seven times in Israel. Just to show you, and I'll take a little time out here. I hadn't been in Israel for five years. I usually go every year. Five-year absence, the number of grace. I hope I'm not being too symbolic. And I came, did not speak one word, not one message in the entire visit. Came the next year, one message only, spoken seven times, this message, three times in Jerusalem, with men whom I've known for over 30 years. And the shrieks and the howls that came out of the congregation, cats, you haven't changed, you're as loveless as ever. It was an astonishment.

You would never imagine that polite congregations could react with such anger and bitterness because I'm in fact predicting the demise of the state of Israel. That what you're now celebrating must be brought into death. This is not that lasting prophetic fulfillment. Yes, God has allowed a return, but not for the fulfillment prophetically that will be millennial and eternal, but an assemblage in order to set in motion the final process of judgment that issues in dispersal, and then the return when I will bring you, when I will plant you. So you'll have a whole millennium to compare what you have sought to establish, ending in failure by rubbing your neighbors the wrong way, exacerbating your neighbors, provoking them in the devices and conduct that you employed in order to keep them in their place or willing to expel or to discourage them to leave that place. See how the Lord has set the stage by allowing a Palestinian presence that would be like a thorn in the side of the nation and a threat.

So in order to contain it, they're required to employ violence, force, threat, intimidation. My wife is there right now on the West Bank. We have involvement with Palestinian Christians, and I know, she knows more than I, that they used to explode percussion grenades.

They don't fragment, but they are deafening and frightening in their explosion to intimidate, to threaten, even to discourage the continuing presence of Palestinians so that they would have the total possession of their own land without a threatening presence within. God Himself has set the stage in order to have factors working that will bring about a conduct in the nation that will contradict what its own aspiration was to be a distinct entity in the Middle East and to show the world what a Jewish nation is in its moral and ethical distinction as compared to Gentile nations. But alack and alas, what do we see presently happening and worsening is conduct just like the Gentile nations, no different because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You can be visionary, you can be romantic, you can be a dreamer. When you're in the ghetto, stroking your beard and reading your Talmud, that you are somehow saintly, ethical. I used to think that about myself.

There's something about us Jews that are self-celebrating. We think ourselves morally superior, and that's why God has got to give us the demonstration in our own conduct that there's no man good, no not one.

You have no distinction as Jews. You're man.

In fact, you are man personified, and you've got to learn the truth of what my scriptures have always said, that if God were to mark iniquity, who can stand? Who is man that can know his own heart and deliver himself from his own sin?

These are not New Testament verses, they're Old Testament.

And yet when you contend with Jews and bring this view, they say that's Christian theology, the total depravity of man. We believe in man, and you Christians believe in man as depraved from Adam, some innate condition from which he needs to be saved and be given a new life.

But we don't subscribe to that. We subscribe to man. Well, subscribe all you want. If you'll not receive the word of my truth, you'll have to learn it in your own bitter and shameful experience.

So we need to understand the process, what's happening and why, and not to encourage them to think that they're going to be extricated from their predicament only momentarily when they make a false treaty of death with an antichrist figure to whom they will yield themselves, having withheld themselves from Jesus, who came in the Father's name, they'll yield themselves to one who comes in his own name, admiring his charisma and his global persona and authority, and with him negotiate a treaty by which they think to obtain their peace. But alas, the scourge shall overflow them and their lies shall be revealed in the judgment that will come by that failure, so that they will have as a final humiliation the realization our condition was so low and so base that we negotiated with the devil for our security, driven by necessity to negotiate with the enemy of our souls, whom we could not recognize until he came into the temple and desired our acknowledgement as God and our worship. Then it broke upon us that our shameful condition allowed us to go that far as to negotiate with him, because we are in such an impasse.

Our geography does not have great mountain peaks. We don't have Switzerland's nature's provision. We're open at the coast for men to come in rubber dinghies and shoot up buses and schools and children. We're defenseless geographically.

And now, in the light of technology, what is it for any nation to shoot a rocket bearing a nuclear warhead or germs or gas or whatever that would be absolutely fatal to Tel Aviv with one strike?

How do we protect against that except through negotiation? And that's what the Oslo Agreement was that failed and other attempts, which is the last gasp of humanism. You need to understand this, you dear saints. Why?

It's predicated on the assumption that if you make a deal with your threatening enemy that will be to his advantage, he will act in his own best self-interest. Yes, he's full of vitriolic hatred against the Jew. He cannot bear the presence of a Jewish state in the midst of what should be a totally Islamic territory. But if you show him an advantage that they can participate now with Israel in the prosperity that will come to the Hong Kong of the Middle East, and you will give them certain concessions of land and statehood and promises that in their own self-interest they will then agree to conditions for peace, and that will be Israel's answer to its predicament. So their devices that lead finally to this humiliating covenant with death is predicated on their own humanism that a negotiated treaty can save them from an otherwise ultimate violence because it appeals to man's better self-interest.

What's wrong with that, Art?

It's a mistaken notion about man acting in his own best interest as if he's a rational creature.

What about man who is irrational?

What about man who can be played upon by demonic powers where hatred and vengeance is more important than survival and prosperity?

Isn't that what suicide bombers are now teaching us? That men even count it a privilege to see their children blown to smithereens if they'll take with them a dozen or more Jews.

Their mistake is a fallacy of understanding about the nature of man, which God gave them every opportunity to see in the Nazi holocaust, and the Germany which they celebrated as being the ultimate civilization of an ethical, cultured kind becomes the very Frankensteinian monster that destroys them.

They had celebrated Germany to the place where German civilization was the messianic answer. Berlin was more desired than Jerusalem. They were more Germans than they were Jews. They loved Goethe, Schiller, Fichte and Hegel more than they did Moses and the prophets.

So God takes that nation so celebrated in the Jewish humanistic love of man and his culture and makes that the engine of their destruction. You would think they would have learned that they would have been broken in their humanistic premises, but no, it takes only a half century, they're back again, resilient, believing in man because in the last analysis they believe in themselves.

They are man, progressive man, enlightened.

So God is showing them by their own conduct what is true about the condition of man that is written in the Word, and Jewish man is not exempt. And finally the conduct that issues from them will precipitate that anger, bitterness and vexation that will be a factor in being forced and expelled out from the land. As you will read in Isaiah 51 and in other places that show a defeated Israel, not only vanquished but humiliated, where the enemy says lie down and we will walk over you and they lie down.

That's future. Where the young men are caught like antelopes in a net at the head of every street.

Where they drink the cup of God's wrath to the dregs.

That's future. We take no pleasure in that.

I don't know that I will have the moral stature even to live through such a time and not come apart at the seams, tough as I am. Will I be able to bear the wholesale devastation of my own people and the rape? When Jesus comes, the women are ravaged. Two-thirds have perished and only one-third remains when the Lord himself comes to save Israel from its final extremity.

And if he didn't come, all three-thirds would have been destroyed. But he saves the one-third and brings them through the fire.

If that's the ratio of Jewish survival in the land and will be the same as the ratio in the world, we're talking about the demise of 10 million Jews in a three-and-a-half-year period. And the survival of a remnant that will return to Zion. I don't know that past history, the Nazi holocaust, is a sufficient preparation for us to bear.

The moral demand of such a time is that. Just to see the widespread devastation of helpless Jews being cut down and their women being brutalized. So it requires something from the Church.

Not only to bear that reality, but to understand God in the midst of it.

Because if you'll fault God, as you'll be tempted to do, and say, where is he?

And how is it that they should suffer again in so short a time after the Nazi holocaust, yet another that eclipses it?

Where is God? Where's his mercy?

We thought that they were now to be settled in the land, and now our hope for them has been exploded.

And the likelihood is we might forfeit our faith. We might forsake it. We might be among the great falling away.

Unless we understand and anticipate these last days' devastations that must come. And that will be followed by the return of Israel.

I'll put a new spirit within you. I'll make an everlasting covenant with you. You'll be my people. I'll be your God.

Israel will be the center, the pivot of all nations. Jerusalem and the holy hill of Zion. Zion will be the very hub of God's theocratic rule over creation. So we have to know the end in order to bear what precedes it.

That's why prophecy is so critically important. That's why the Old Testament understanding. That's why the mystery of Israel is a requirement for the Church. And if we don't obtain it, we will be bewildered, offended, and might even forfeit our trust in God and in His Word.

And find ourselves even adverse to that people who disappoint us in their failure.

What does it say about a woman who, the wrath of a woman, spurned?

What about the indignation of a Church disappointed in a nation that does not bring about the fulfillment for which they hoped out of their own idealism, out of their own romanticism, which is itself the last vestige of humanism? There's more humanism in the Church, dear saints, and in this room than you can know. It will be our undoing as it is Israel's, unless we recognize that idealism is a human projection. Romanticism is that man fancifully conceiving of things contrary and other than the way that God states them. It's the desire for success.

We want to see an Israel improved. We don't want to have to anticipate apocalyptic devastation.

That's why the false prophets are always heeded and the true prophets are always persecuted. The true prophet is saying, there's a doom that must come. There's a judgment that must come that is inescapable.

Prepare yourself for it. Repent.

The false prophets are saying, peace, peace, when there is no peace, and take the wounds of my daughter lightly.

To whom will you be attracted? Something that's favorable to your ear. Israel will still make it. They'll succeed. It's just a momentary trouble. They will be established. Encourage. Send Jews to Israel. It's the safest place in the world. Really? It'll be the vortex of violence. It'll be a place of wholesale devastation. It's the worst thing that you could do is bring them to almost a certain death.

Better to prepare a place of refuge in the nations than to send them to the vortex of violence in Israel.

My opinion, which is not popular.

What we need to recognize in this chapter is that God is as much concerned with the son of man as he is with Israel. And that the son of man who was brought down by the hand of the Lord and the spirit of God into the Valley of Dry Bones is as much the object of God's attention and concern as Israel.

He's a prophet. Doing well while he was up there in that charismatic realm.

But he's got to come into a place for his own sake that is more profound than what he had known, however successful.

In fact, he's got to come into a place that even stretches to breaking the limit not only of his charismatic faith but his prophetic faith.

Can these bones live, son of man? Who can see a valley which is a place of depression full of bones and have a faith to believe that those bones can be brought to life? The prophet has to acknowledge however much I had a measure of faith that was impressive in the other location now in the valley I cannot bring myself to say that they can live. All I can say is Lord thou knowest. This is a trial and a test for the son of man himself as prophet which is needful because he's the instrument of Israel's restoration through the prophecies which he speaks which can only be effective to the degree that he himself believes that the word out of his mouth will raise those bones unto life. We ourselves need to know that the son of man is not some mysterious entity that we can admire from a distance but that we ourselves are called to be that son. That corporate son of man who is called to prophesy is nothing other than we ourselves that have been brought down and out and into a valley that we would shrink from visiting because it's grim because we want to stay where it's pleasant success, prosperity, enjoyment and think that that is what the prophetic reality is.

We don't want to be brought down. We don't welcome the hand of the Lord that would bring us down. We shrink from it. We don't want to confront those bones. We have no stomach for it.

If you really want to know the absolute truth we have no desire that those bones should live. So long your prime focus and the object of your affection and attention that we don't want to see a nation revived that will compete with us for your love.

We want to be the sole object of your attention as the prodigal, the brother of the prodigal son could not even enter the feast. He stayed outside. He was on strike. You never did this for me. Why are you giving this character who has wasted his inheritance and was eating masks with pigs for him? You run to meet him with a kiss? Give him a ring and a garment and make a party for him? I'm not attending. I've served you faithfully all these years and you never did that for me? Self-pitying.

Father says, why don't you rejoice?

This son who is lost is now found.

He who is dead is now alive.

The older brother could not bring himself to share the father's joy.

That's a statement of the Church, dear saints, that is not happy for Israel's restoration.

They just as soon leave those bones as bones and say, that's what you deserve. You had your opportunity and you blew it.

And now we are the Israel of God and we enjoy the singular attention of the Most High.

Something has got to happen. The issue is not Israel. The issue is the son of man.

He has to be changed profoundly and conditioned, brought down and into a new place, stretched beyond his faith to believe, beyond his desire to believe and be the actual instrument of the speaking. And if he is not in union with the God who has brought him down by the Spirit and have that God's heart for the restoration of those bones, he has not that authority to speak the authoritative word of resurrection, those bones remain inert.

The son of man is the issue. The Church is the issue.

So, the son of man himself has got to be brought into a valley of death.

That's where his humanism bites the dust. That's where his prophetic, charismatic status that he enjoyed and would like to retain has got to die. That's where his jealousy against the people represented by the bones must perish.

It's a valley of death not only for Jews, it's a valley of death for the son of man. For nothing less or other than death can seek out and find and bring to a termination those elements of humanistic self-adulation that resides in the secret heart of every believer and yet will be enough to keep them from the fulfillment to be to Israel what they must in the authority and love of every God. There's a death for us before there's a death for them or else we will not have resurrection authority in order to bring those bones to life by our speaking.

And last night you got a little taste of it more than you know. I was devastated. I was emptied. I was depressed. I was without inspiration, without desire, flat out and a death that I could taste. But the willingness to taste it issued in life.

The moment I opened my mouth despairing that anything could come out of me in that condition the word began to proceed and as it went on it gained in weight and dimension and power to bring and communicate that message not only for you but for the Church of Australia which is essential for its last time's consideration and if it didn't come from this mouth last night I'm not expecting it will come again.

I know that sounds awfully vain. They say, Art, who else is speaking like you? Who else has this perspective like you?

It may be that there are those but I don't know them and if they exist they're not at your top level of popular prophets. They're unseen unheralded, concealed but there are not many and I have to just assume with Elijah that I alone am left and act as if I'm a one vessel through whom this apocalyptic perception of last day's reality is being communicated but how can it be spoken to an audience that is guarding itself and doesn't want to hear the implications of becoming strangely frightening. This is more than we bargained for in just being evangelical and charismatic. This is a requirement that who knows what it will ultimately mean for us.

So there's a resistance.

I was seeing that resistance last night that had to be penetrated that can only be penetrated not by human ability, man raising his voice several decibels but by the power of God through the word as a resurrection phenomenon.

Got the picture? The first death must be yours and it comes through the word.

In fact someone has rightly said every true preaching is a bringing of the hearers into death.

Even in areas they didn't know that required death and that they were secretly coveting, nurturing and keeping alive. And no one ever faulted them.

They live in a permissive atmosphere in which we are all in that condition and think it normative.

We don't want to bite the dust.

We don't want to come to an end of our own humanisms, our own idealisms, our own romanticisms, even about the faith, about ministry, about the various things. It's a lingering deep thing and it comes to a head in this remarkable chapter that after being commanded to prophesy to the bones and he obeys which is itself a death, obedience is a death because it's never a call to convenience and you're obeying and bringing something up that you would rather see remain inert. But the final requirement is after the bones come together, the flesh, speak to the spirit, speak to the ruach, command the ruach to bring this life into those bones and into that flesh or else they're yet dead while they have the outward form of life. The last and the necessary thing is the ruach of God, his spirit. And the prophet is commanded to command the spirit to come in.

And that's where the prophet would draw the line. That's where you'll draw the line. Not me, Lord. I'm going to command you? You are the ruach. I'm going to command God? That's an offense to my sensibility. That's an offense to my principles. No, I'm willing to speak to bones and flesh but I'll not command you.

I mean you're the most high God. You're the almighty.

You're the one to whom I've been singing choruses all my life long and I'm just a whipper snapper. I'm going to command you? God says unless you command me, you have no place with me because I'm requiring that commandment because I know you.

And this is where your humanism has its last refuge in your supposed spirituality and your unwillingness to lose it by commanding me.

And unless you lose it, unless you die there, I do not have you in that full possession by which you can be the salvific agent of my people's restoration.

Your spirituality, the subtlety of your own self-exaltation, which is no longer carnal.

You've given that up long before.

The issue for you is not retaining a carnal image, it's a spiritual image.

And you feel that if you command me, they would violate what you have so long nurtured and kept and violate.

It's your image, it's your integrity, it's what you are.

And I have even given you the ingredients for that. So what I've given you by which that's built, I'm now asking you to relinquish and forsake. To give it up and to die to it.

To come into a much better place than charismatic and evangelical spirituality. And that better place, which is God's ultimate intention for the Church, which you have never thought is union with himself. That you can say with Paul, for me to live is Christ.

Why?

There's no longer anyone contending with Christ. There's no other entity in life.

I know you.

What you're saying is, Lord, I want to help you, I want to do good things for your name.

If you give me this ability and this assistance, I will do. And all this for a season. And your immaturity. But my ultimate intention is not you as a separate entity from me, but you in union with me. Where it cannot be said, where you end and I begin. My thought is your thought. My disposition is your disposition. My word is your word. My authority is your authority. How can I entrust that to you? Just being merely spiritual and separate. Can you see what God is after?

Not only Israel's restoration, but the Church's transcendence. The Church coming into the ultimate place of God's intention and an identity that will keep forever, eternally.

It will be the bride. It will be in union with him.

Because how else is he to have dominion over creation, which God gave to them? The Adam and Eve, the prototype. So if there's no regent, there's no co-regent, then the Lord cannot rule.

He's got to have a partner.

He's got to have a wife for the bridegroom that is like him, having the glory of God.

It's in union with him. But we don't want to relinquish.

We don't want to give up that last, most dear thing, in which self hides.

You've taken the ground out from under it.

It can no longer conceal itself in pornography and other flagrant carnal things. And then you went to culture and intellectual things, and it still had a place in which to hide and to exert itself and to be nurtured and be strengthened. And then you rose above that to spiritual heights, and this was the ultimate thing that you enjoyed and wanted to be recognized by others as being spiritual. But the subtlety of self found a final refuge and hiding place. And so will it remain until you command the Ruach of God, until you command God. It will violate your utmost spiritual sensibility. It will seem like, and it is a terrible affront, that a piece of dust and earth, a son of man, should command God, yet he in his wisdom is willing to suffer that indignation of being commanded by a creature to the Creator. Because only it will release you from the final vestiges of self that hide itself in your supposed spirituality. It's the crisis of Israel that compels you to come out and down and into and be commanded to these final things by which you end as an entity.

You don't see anything more the son of man. After Israel, there's not any reference to him at all. What happened? He has become one. He's in union.

And he's speaking the authoritative word of God in resurrection power because he's in union with that power and with that life. Willing to relinquish the good to obtain the perfect.

Painful, that final yielding up.

The scriptures don't tell us what it cost that son of man, but you can be sure it was a death.

He gulped. He swallowed hard. It was the last thing that he was willing to yield. He liked being a charismatic prophet. And he was successful in that. And he had a measure of faith for that. But when he came down into the valley, whatever measure he had was inadequate.

Because he needed the faith of the son of God himself. For only that faith can believe that those bones can live.

I brought a bone yesterday we talked about the Passover, which I thought was the shank bone of a lamb. White. Turning to dust. My brother said when I told him I think I'm going to speak on Ezekiel 37, he said did you bring the bone? I should be passing that bone through the congregation. And you can see how hopeless an object, a white desiccated dried out bone is in having any potential for life. And that's why Israel must be reduced to that state.

Not only for its sake that it might experience God as the God who resurrects the dead and makes those things to be which were not, but that the church itself will come to a transcendent faith beyond what it now enjoys or employs. The faith of the son of God. Everything is moving to this consummation.

Both for the church and for Israel. But one last thing.

Even to obtain the faith of the son of God will not make that commandment work that raises those bones. Unless it's a faith that works through love.

But not your schmaltzy sentimentality. Not your little affection for Jews and for Israel because they're cute.

It's the love of God that is unconditional when they're not cute.

When they're mean-spirited. When they're ugly. When they're battered and bruised.

When they're full of indignation and think that what they're suffering is the result of Christianity itself and its bankruptcy, which is the way they explain the Nazi Holocaust, is the way they will explain the coming Holocaust.

Will you be able to take it? Will you be able to bear it? Because you desire their recognition and their approval and their gratitude? I know you, Gentile believers.

There's something about you that's craven that to receive Jewish approval you pant for that.

I don't know why that is. That's worth examining. But it will betray you and compromise you. And it will not suffice at the valley of dry bones. Mere affection. Mere natural affinity will not suffice.

The only thing that will make that faith to work, which is that God's faith, is equally God's love.

But how do you obtain it? By dying to the lesser thing.

Are you willing to forfeit and give up your present affection for Israel and for the Jew? Which is one of the distinctive components of your very spirituality? That's what distinguishes you from lesser saints is the identification you have with the Jew. Which is an important aspect of our own identification and our own self esteem.

You need to see that.

And God says, if this command and prophesying is going to work, it will only work by a love that is much greater than that. Because this love that is shallow and sentimental is tinged with self concern and self aggrandizement.

It is symbiotic.

There's a value for you in this kind of affection for Israel because it elevates you as being spiritual. To relinquish that is to forfeit maybe the heart of the thing that distinguishes you and by which you obtain your own self esteem.

And if you give that up unto death, who are you? And what are you? You become a blob. You have no distinction. No entity. Except that which is given.

Or in fact that which was always potentially there but has been hindered by these lesser things that have uptruded and kept you because he who loses his life finds it.

Israel has brought you to the impasse.

If it were not for the crisis of Israel, you would have continued in your present condition and been applauded for it as being exemplary and a statement of superior spirituality to which we should all aspire. But the crisis of Israel reveals not only its inadequacy but its counterfeit quality. That there's something ultimate, greater that issues from God which he will not bestow so long as you cleave to and cling to that thing by which your identity has been established over the course of years.

It's a willing death. It's a voluntary giving up.

If you'll not do it, if you'll not command his spirit, if you'll not be willing to perform that thing that is the contradiction of all that you've understood of what spiritual means, you'll not prophesy.

The bones will not live. They'll remain a heap. There's so much more in this chapter.

The two sticks, what they represent. It's such a consummation of everything that had been at enmity one with the other and now are made one in his hand and it will be before their eyes and he will gather them in verse 21. He will take the children of Israel from among the heathen whither they be gone, where they have been driven in judgment, will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land.

Again, another statement. So evidently, this cannot be the description of Israel of 1948.

This is something future because it waits upon something from Israel itself. The only thing that Israel provides is the acknowledgement that they are hopeless, they are cut off, they are dry bones.

And anyone who knows anything about Jewish history, including the Nazi holocaust, knows this. That that admission and that acknowledgement was not obtained. They didn't come out from the Nazi holocaust looking like bones. Yes, that's why we're tempted to think that was its fulfillment.

But instead of saying we are cut off, we are without hope, we are as dry bones, which God waits for, the acknowledgement of Jewish destitution and utter hopelessness that he might be to us what he is.

Instead of hearing that, what did he hear? Never again. Never again. As if our being brought into the concentration camps and into its gas chambers and into its fire furnaces was a statement of our weakness.

But now that we are a nation unto ourselves and have military prowess and atomic ability and technological know-how, never again. As if we can determine our fate and our destiny as man independent of God.

Can you understand?

The holocaust was not this death because it did not issue in this final acknowledgement that we are cut off, we are without hope, we are as dry bones. It's the only thing for which God waits from Israel. It's the only thing that is the condition for their resurrection is the acknowledgement that they're dead. And if you know the stubbornness of Jewish self-sufficiency and pride, you'll know it's going to take a very real death, slain, to bring them to this acknowledgement. Whatever it takes, God will bring it.

For He must have this concession.

And then He can turn to the Son of Man and say, prophesy to these bones that they might live.

And with their restoration, He brings them into the land. Amos says, I will plant you in the land. Isn't that a beautiful figure?

As against the human thing that is Jacob-like, that usurps, that grasps the heel, that manipulates and engineers its own state. The state of Israel is the state of Jacob. Use man in his own activity, his own cogitation, his own shrewdness, his own power.

But I will plant you. I will bring you back. I will raise you up out of your graves. I will plant you in the land. And you will not ever again be plucked up and drawn out. When I plant you, it will be enduring and eternal. And pacific, peaceful.

And there will be no agitation with your neighbors that will be a factor again of terror and fear.

Let alone to force you out. You will not again be displaced.

And you will experience such millennial blessing that those who sow seed will be nipping at the heels of those who are bringing in the harvest.

You will fill the earth with fruit.

Not only of a tangible and physical kind, but of a spiritual. For I will bless you and put my spirit within you.

And you shall be my covenantal people and not break it. It will be an everlasting covenant because I will see to it that I who have made it will also fulfill it.

For I will write it in your hearts and in your inward parts.

And you'll all know me.

You'll all know God from the least to the greatest.

And you'll make me known.

As not your Talmudic version, not your rabbinical concept, but the reality of the God who has raised you from the dead. For the God who raises from the dead is the God who is God.

So how come that you were hoping for Israel's success? And progressive improvement?

Why is it you didn't realize that the Lord was setting the stage both for death and resurrection? That only resurrection can bring forth a nation that will bless all the families of the earth? It's because you yourselves did not subscribe to resurrection. Because you yourselves were content with improvement and progressive amelioration. Because your motive was success and not to the glory of God forever. And because you were satisfied with a humanistic concept of success rather than glory, you projected upon Israel what you desire for yourself.

And it's wrong.

Until you understand nothing less than resurrection is the issue of God's glory forever. But not resurrection as a doctrinal principle, but as actuality and reality in your own life. So there's a final death, not of your carnality, but that last thing that keeps you from union, your spirituality. The last thing that has been operative here in these days, in which there's been a bucking and a restlessness and irritation because the words were intimating that God was calling for something that we were wanting to resist.

And what comes with the returning to the land? I will cleanse them. I will save them. They shall be my people. I'll be their God. And David, my servant in verse 24, shall be king over them. And they all shall have one shepherd.

They shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them.

They shall dwell in the land. Isn't that a beautiful word? That I have given that cannot be Jacob obtained. That cannot be ruthlessly grasped.

I have given unto Jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein implying peace and prosperity and blessedness.

They and their children, their children's children forever. And my servant David shall be their prince forever. Well, we know who that servant David is.

The crucified and risen one.

Morever I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them, multiply them.

I will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.

I will dwell and rule from their Zion.

The law will go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of a restored Jerusalem who have been reduced to heaps and will be built again unto the name of the Lord.

My tabernacle also shall be with them. I will be their God. They shall be my people.

And the heathen, the nations shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.

Period. Exclamation point.

The final capstone is not only the church's transfiguration in union with Christ as bride eternally. Not only Israel's restoration to the place of God's intention central to all nations, but that the nations, the heathen will know. Because this demonstration of Israel's dispersal and judgment and death and resurrection will be so visible it will not be hid.

It will not be performed in a corner.

It will be before the face of all nations. And they shall know that as Israel knows that I am the Lord who has spoken and done this, the nations will know that who the Lord is who has done this and will come into the oversight of God and into the relatedness of the nations and into his kingdom and into his rule when they shall see that he is in his sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.

This is cryptic. This is terse.

One little verse but it speaks remarkable volumes of the end of God's dealing with nations that begins with the Tower of Babel in which he has to disperse them and confound their languages because of their own hubris, their own pride to be higher than God. And what is the end of that final dispersal with the nations and their rebellion and their opposition to God, their opposition to his people Israel is their final surrender to himself as God when they will see his dealing with Israel both in judgment and in mercy and that he has set his sanctuary, his rule and his dwelling in their midst forevermore. Dear Saints, one chapter encapsulates the remarkable redemptive sweep of God that was his mind from the beginning and is his consummation at the end in which the agent for the fulfillment and the restoration and the bringing of the nations is a son of man, a corporate company that will allow themselves to be brought down and into a place contrary to everything in their flesh and even in their the subtlety of spirit and there be dealt with and become the instrument and in the becoming of the instrument be brought into union with him forevermore, the bride of Christ having the glory of God, the nature of God obtained through death in the valley of dry bones. So this I believe is where Paul received his essential inspiration by which in the book of Romans he then speaks it out in terms of the central role of the church to the Jew. This is the mystery of God and we need to recognize that mystery, submit to that mystery and rejoice for that mystery because he's glorified by it forever. Restored nation transfigured church bride, submission of the nations to his rule. It's the glory of God forever.

Thank you Lord.

Precious God, mercy upon us Lord.

Look upon us.

Look upon our frailty Lord that the words of bouncing off our minds can't retain. The breadth of this is too great for us to consider Lord. And the stubborn, tenacious humanism that lingers in us yet as a church has more cogency and more power than the spirit of your word.

There's a resistance we can't surrender, we can't embrace this Lord.

And we're not willing for the death verdict that this chapter describes that must come upon us as a son of man company.

We don't want to give up the ghost.

We want to retain what we have so long labored to affect and to perfect, which is not carnal but spiritual. And yet it's the last impediment to the realization of the glory of your will. And even now we can forfeit, even now we can willingly bring to death that last vestige by recognizing Lord you have fingered something this morning that I'm loathe to acknowledge let alone to forego. My whole conscious adult life as a believer has been the cultivation, the nurturing, the perfecting of this spirituality.

I don't want to forfeit it. My identity is intrinsic, it's caught up with it. And I'm afraid that if I give it up unto death what will then be? Will there be a resurrection? Will I be brought into a newness? Will the result be greater than what I'm giving up? Will I live because you live also?

You believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord and God has raised him from the dead. Thou shalt be saved. Same faith, same belief in the resurrection.

Lord, precious God, put a seal on this speaking this morning. Let it not fall to the ground. Let it set in motion, my God.

Even the processes of death from which we shrink that has got to find us out has got to perform its work or there will not be that consummation that union of a people who can prophesy with your authority and your love sufficient to raise Israel from her grave. It's a remarkable mystery, Lord, and we have part in it in our own willingness to submit, my God, both to your death and to the power of your resurrection. So come, Lord, and have willing voluntary candidates who do not have to be brought down and in but are willing themselves to come because the issue of their life more than their own satisfaction and delight in their spirituality is your glory forever. Come, my God, obtain that yieldedness, that willing and voluntary death and fulfill this mystery, my God, to the everlasting praise of your glory. In Jesus' name we pray.

Amen.
