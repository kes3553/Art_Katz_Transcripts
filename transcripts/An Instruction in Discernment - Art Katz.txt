An Instruction in Discernment - Art Katz

I'll read it to you, and you'll think, well, why should anyone be disappointed in a selection of this kind?

And that question will lead into what's on my heart to share. Because by every reckoning, this is perfectly legitimate, biblical, sound, exposition, and what he's commending with less many, and yet, because of the whatever I am or where I am, it jars me. And I'll try to explain why it is I'm in conflict with an otherwise ostensibly sound piece of spiritual counsel, and it's called Stained Alert. On the 20th of June, our Lord Jesus Christ, who during his ministry here on earth used metagraphic images in his parables, for example, understands better than anyone how physical things can be used to increase spiritual awareness and understanding. I confess that for many years I've used some of the practices people have developed to help them remember how close God is to them as nothing more than crutches needed only by those who would not give priority to daily Bible reading and prayer. So these daily readings in this section for the months of May and June are on knowing the presence of God, or finding the presence of God, and every day he's giving another tip on how to come into this reality, so he's been commending daily Bible reading and prayer. As I've talked with the Christian about their spiritual lives, however, I've had to change my mind about this, where I've seen how in addition to regular Bible reading and prayer, the establishing of a single daily habit has made their relationship with God even more meaningful. Now he's going to describe this habit that he's encountered. We think now about another practice used by some in order to remind themselves of God's continuing presence in their lives. Right away, if you're too good at a certain way, your hackles will begin to rise when he uses language like reminding themselves of God's continuing presence, as if it's a function of man, and if you do this or do that, you can become more aware of God's presence by reminding yourself, and yet counsel like this will bless unfold millions, and they will bless you.

So let me read on.

Being alert and watching for anything interesting or unusual that happens during the day and immediately bringing God into it, one woman I know who does this explains, Whenever something unusual or unexpected happens in my day, such as bumping into a friend I haven't seen for years or receiving a surprise phone call or gift, I immediately relate to happening to God and say, Lord, how lovely of you to arrange my day in this way. I have done this so often that now, that's the woman's statement that he says, I have done this myself so often now, it has become a fixed habit. One that immediately focuses my mind on his all-pervading presence.

So what's the new thing that he's hearing?

Whatever happens of a novel kind especially, some unexpected visit, a call, a gift, use it to say, Lord, thank you for bringing this into my day, and as you exercise this kind of guideline, you're brought into the remembrance of the presence of God.

Is that okay with you? Can you say amen? Would this be valid counsel? It will bless many. It doesn't bless me.

In fact, I think I'm tempted to cancel my subscription because this man is writing and speaking from a certain place that shapes me, and that place is this. It's the sense that there are two entities, man and God, and they are relatively independent of each other, and man can by exercise of his own will and by devices and practices bring himself into a consciousness of this other who is God.

And you say, well, what's wrong with that?

Well, at a certain stage of spiritual growth, nothing is wrong.
