The Gospel and the Righteousness of God Revealed - Art Katz

I am yearning to sink our teeth into the second of Paul's opening statement that deserves such a probing that after saying that his gospel is the power of God and the salvation to the Jew first, those of the Greek, for in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith, for faith as it is written, the one who is righteous will live by faith, that the issue of the gospel is the issue of righteousness and that by it the righteousness of God is revealed. And which of us right now could so much as compose a single statement on what the righteousness of God is that waits on the gospel to reveal it? The issue of how do we begin to even move toward the appropriation of the word holy or holiness, we have not first come to some elementary consideration of the word righteousness. Righteousness is almost the key to holiness, the route to holiness. If you read today's chapter in Proverbs, chapter 11, it celebrates the righteous man, how the righteous man is prospered, how the righteous man is honored. The word righteous is central to God. The scepter of righteousness is the scepter of his kingdom, but what in heaven's name is it? And Paul is saying the gospel is that revelation.

So that deserves another prayer.

Lord, if we stumble over this, if we lightly dismiss this, we've lost the ballgame even before it's begun to be played. It's imperative that we understand and cherish what righteousness is. And it may well be that unless we apprehend it through the gospel, there's no other way. And that the gospel is the epitome, the sum and the substance of righteousness. So Lord, we desire to know that word. We desire to love that word. We desire to live that word. And we're asking your blessing afresh now as we move to the second part of Paul's remarkable opening statement. Come Lord and help us with a little help we pray in Jesus' name.

Amen.

So I have before me one of the great commentaries on Romans by John Murray, who is greatly detailed in explicating every verse. And you want to hear his statement of why the Jew first? So since Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and since the church at Rome was preponderantly Gentile, it is the more significant that he should have intimidated so expressly and priority that the priority of the Jew. So it does not appear sufficient to regard the priority as merely a matter of time. The implication appears to be rather that the power of God and the salvation through faith has primary relevance to the Jew. And the analogy of scripture would indicate that this peculiar relevance to the Jew arrives from the fact that the Jew had been chosen by God to be the recipient of the promise of the gospel. And that to him were committed the oracles of God. Salvation was of the Jews and the lines of preparation for the full revelation of the gospel were laid in Israel. And for that reason, the gospel is preeminently the gospel for the Jew. How totally contrary to the current attitude of Jewry that Christianity is for the Gentiles but not for Israel. It is expressly and uniquely first and foremost for the Jew. The Gentile is the Johnny come lately. The Gentile is not the first intended recipient. But you who are far off without God and hope in the world through God has by the blood of the Messiah brought nigh or near into the hopes and promises and the covenant of Israel even into the commonwealth of Israel. This is Paul's explanation of a secondary application of the gospel. But salvation is of the Jews. That's why Peter required a trance in order to be open to the even the thought that what they had received as Jews is now also to come to Gentiles. That's a revolutionary, totally unprecedented thought that required a trance to be communicated by an Orthodox Jew Peter who would not otherwise have ever gone into Cornelius' house. An observant Jew does not come into the house of Gentiles.

It's defiled.

And when when God gave me a relationship with one of these Hasidic Jews years ago in New Jersey, it's a whole story. And when he came to visit me, he came with a brown paper bag, styrofoam cup, and a plastic spoon. All he would receive from me in my house because it was mixed bag with a Gentile wife was boiling water. And there he would put his teabag and his styrofoam cup and swish it with his plastic spoon. But that was as close as he would come to eating anything from off of my mixed and defiled table.

You need to know.

So for Peter to come into the house of Cornelius and speak the message in the speaking of which the Holy Spirit falls on Gentiles was an utter astonishment. I remember the vision of the veil that came down with unclean animals and God's command, kill and eat or take and eat. And Paul's cry even in his trance condition, Lord, I've never touched anything unclean. Call not unclean what I have made clean. And when he wakes to that startling exclamation, there's someone downstairs at the door, Gentiles from Cornelius' house asking for Peter to come and explain to them.

You guys need to know.

The church needs to know that you are secondary. You're not the first intention, but it's the grace of God through the blood of the Messiah to bring you wild branches who are far off without God and without hope in the world into the Commonwealth of Israel. Salvation is of the Jews. You've received a salvation intended for them by the grace and the mercy of God for which you need to have in your heart a gratitude and that you have been grafted in a tree that is not your own. Left to your own tree, you'd be fruitless still. But the grace and mercy of God, having broken their branches off in unbelief, is to graft you in that you might be fruit bearing and by your fruit, move them to envy.

Got the idea?

And who should have a greater faith for their return than you? Because if he was able to graft you in, who have no natural right even to be included, that you can sap and draw life from that root, how much more then shall they be returned to their own root? You ought to have the greatest faith to believe for their return seeing that you yourself, having no qualification, have been brought in. Think of Paul's apostolic call in Acts 13, separate unto me Paul and Barnabas, was it, for the work unto which I've called them. That work is never identified, but the believers hearing from the Holy Spirit that these are men called forth, prayed and fasted, laid hands upon them, so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went. But where did they go? In the very first place in that Mediterranean world, they proclaimed the gospel to the Jew. So Paul, by the natural process of the Son of God in him, was already demonstrating in his own experience the principle of God to the Jew first, which he later now expresses pointedly to the Gentile Church of Rome. But he didn't do it as a principle, he did it as the natural outworking of the residency of the Son of God in him, as God's divine desire and love for the chosen people to the Jew first. Then seeing in his practice what God repeats in every community, in every location, he then formulates as a principle and sets it before the Roman Church. But though it's a principle, we don't do it by principle. We do it by the same life by which Paul did it.

See what I mean?

It was wonderful to find in the natural outworking of the life of God in us a corroboration and confirmation of God's principles. But to do it as principle is to be religious or under obligation.

I guess I got to.

How much more glorious and true is the thing just issuing from us, as I said about that group of Gentiles in Northern California, where I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Something issued from them, not as an issue of obligation, but out of a love, which is the Lord's love for his own people through them even as Gentiles, that so affected an environment and atmosphere for me that I was able to receive the baptism of the Spirit, which for a year I had been seeking with great difficulty and not finding, because I was not in the environment in which the Spirit was free to so manifest himself.

You understand what I'm saying?

Paul is establishing a principle, but it's not a practice to be performed as a principle. When you reduce the glory of the gospel to a principle and you're doing it as a principle, you've moved from faith to religion, to something that you're humanly performing. What God is intending is what Marlene is touching, that as for Paul, so for us, something ought to issue that would express itself in an urgency and a love for this people that makes them a first priority. And we find ourselves acting in accordance with the principle, but not because of the principle.

Is that open your heads? Can you follow that?

That this whole issue of the Jew, his priority through the church is the righteousness of God.

I can't even explain myself.

There's something in the heart of God toward a people chosen that are yet a first priority, despite their apostasy and rejection, even be the instruments of his own crucifixion, that is the very demonstration of righteousness. That's what righteousness is, not to neglect or to refuse a consideration to a people who are the very instruments of your death, but still to hold them in esteem and as being a first consideration because of their chosenness, because of their history, because of their fathers. That's righteousness, at least an aspect of an understanding of what righteousness is. It's the righteousness of God. And when it's expressed through us, it's all the more glorious. So when it's expressed as the working out of his life, that's righteous. If it's expressed as a religious principle under which we feel a kind of constraint and obligation and never a joy in doing it, it's no longer righteous. It's unrighteous. We're trying to find why Paul is saying that the gospel itself is the revelation of the righteousness of God. And I'm thinking and saying for the first time publicly, going on record, that is not the least of the reasons why it's the righteousness of God is because it's to the Jew first. All the more because they are the ones who stoned the prophets, rejected their own Messiah, were instrumental in his death. And yet God says to the Jew first. That's righteousness. Unrighteous would say, well, let them suffer.

They had their chance. They blew it. They've rejected.

Then now it goes to the Gentile and they're out of the picture. That would be unrighteous that they're yet in the picture with a foremost destiny that their Zion is to be the capstone and the spiritual capital of the world. And out of Zion is to go forth the law. And the word of the Lord is a testimony to the glory and exaltation God yet reserves for that nation, though presently apostate. If you have an attitude like that and an interest like that and a jealousy like that, that's righteousness.

I do not explain it.

That's a righteous attitude because it is so self-dismissing where a God would have every right to be offended and snubbed and say, tough on them.

They've had their chance.

And we would all say, yes, that's right, because we're men that are unrighteous.

We would agree quickly.

God is different. He says, though they have blown it and blown it grievously, they are not dismissed from my consideration because my love does not require conditions to be fulfilled in order to be obtained. In fact, I'm showing myself as the righteous God all the more by being to them what I am despite their indifference and their undeservedness. My mercy is my righteousness. And unless I show it to the Jew, I'm not demonstrating it to the world. And if I can demonstrate it to the world through the Jew, who in the world would be exempt from my mercy? Who will say that they're not deserving or that God passed me by when we see that he's bestowing to a people who have been historically virtually his enemy and the instruments of his crucifixion? And yet this mercy is a first priority. How then shall we feel ourselves exempt? That's why this is so critical at the heart of the matter. This is the heart of reality itself. And not to dismiss too quickly the issue of acting out of principle or acting out of the life of God. Paul himself, as I've already indicated, is that demonstration. When he proclaimed the gospel to the Jew in every place, not because he was under the obligation of a principle, that principle had not yet been enunciated. The principle came out from the experience of a Paul who was moved by the life of God to follow the divine logic of God, yet to the Jew first. And when you examine 9 through 11, how does it begin? The cry of Paul that he would wish himself accursed for his brethren's sake. It's the deepest identification. And how does it end? The greatest exaltation. All the depths of the riches both of the wisdom of God.

We've seen the mystery of Israel.

So when I preach this I say, don't think that you're dismissed from Paul's cry in chapter 9 because you don't begin with a comparable cry. You'll not end with a comparable doxology or the depths of the riches. But on what basis does Paul cry out at the commencement of chapter 9? Is it because he's ethnically a Jew himself that he wishes himself accursed for his brethren's sake? Or is this the heart cry of very God himself who became accursed for his brethren's sake? So that Paul's cry is not ethnic but apostolic. And if it's apostolic then we have every right and in fact obligation to be able to sound that cry ourselves to the degree that we have that union with God's heart. He's crying out of a union with God's heart. And it opens the way for the revelation of the mystery that ends with the great doxology or the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. So the church is devoid of the mystery to the same degree as it lacks the ability to cry out with Paul over the plight of Jews who are without Christ and that we are willing for this sacrifice almost even of our own salvation that they might be saved. The righteousness of God is revealed through faith, for faith as it is written, the one who is righteous will live by faith. What's the conjunction between faith and righteousness expressed in the initial statement of Paul that sounds the great, these are the great opening themes of the rhapsodic message of Romans and in it is the word faith inserted in conjunction with the word righteousness.

Any clue?

Can righteousness be understood, revealed, received or expressed independent of faith? And if the message itself is the power of God into salvation what does that power perform? But what the power performs is to create faith. Faith comes by the word and the hearing of the word. The sent word, the apostolic word in Romans 10, how shall they call upon him of whom they've not believed except one preach?

Let's look at that.

Somebody read that in Romans 10. Paul says how shall they believe in them of whom they've not heard and how shall they hear except one preach and how shall they preach except one be sent? For faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so that the issue of the righteousness of God can only be apprehended by faith and not by mental gymnastics or logic or the exercise of intellect or cerebral ability or that would dismiss the possibility for salvation for the great multitude of mankind and make it only the privileged experience of a select few. But the issue of salvation is without partiality so then the apprehension of the message of the salvation has got to be exclusively by faith and that map of yourself it is a gift lest any man boast. See the whole remarkable thing is established in terms that are righteous because if it was partial and just an exclusive prerogative of those who have the ability all now I see what God is saying. I think I'll believe that then it would dismiss the great mankind but if it's an issue of faith which is given as a grace and order to receive and that the word itself creates that faith then God is altogether righteous in the way in which he presents salvation to mankind.

Got the picture?

The gospel is the statement of God's righteousness not only its content but its mode of delivery and the means by which it is received as salvation. It's remarkable and without that revelation how can anyone know in fact what righteousness is as this is the most unique and monumental statement not just as an elaboration of a word but as a demonstration of a power unto salvation to the outermost to everyone who believes to the Jew first but also to the Greek not to the Jew first because of his intellect but because of his believing but what's the basis for his believing the word itself that was sent and is apostolically proclaimed in power to create faith to believe a message that is otherwise totally offensive to human consideration and would be rejected if it had to be considered on the basis of our minds. So the gospel is so to speak enacted in the gospels but the exposition and the articulation of the gospel and its implications comes with the apostles and that God who suffered the death and was raised by it and trusts the exposition to those who follow him especially Paul on what basis that the same life of Christ now is functioning through a man who says for me to live is Christ and therefore it's the Lord continuing to explain himself through the apostle in things that waited for his resurrection and could not be taken up before it so you got the idea and in that act of generosity to the Gentiles what is revealed the righteousness of God where do you guys figure in by what right what was your qualification you were drinking beer out of skulls as Simon has heard me say a thousand times and fornicating like Jack Roberts you had no distinction that deserved the consideration of God but his righteousness extended his mercy to those who were without God and without hope in the world through the blood of Israel's messiah and grephing you into their tree that very act and that consideration is the righteousness of God that's what righteousness is righteousness is magnanimity and generosity and love extension of remarkable grace to the undeserving so then if that's what righteousness is of what shall our righteousness consist you think God is giving us an exposition of righteousness that we can be clever at the next coffee table discussion or is he giving us an exposition of righteousness that we ourselves might be righteous and act in the same way in the issues that are before us that require our magnanimity our generosity our grace our forgiveness we've got to love righteousness and where do we learn to love it when we see it as revealed in the gospel from faith to faith even that phrase from faith to faith maybe even could be expressed to the degree of faith to whatever measure of faith you have to that degree you understand the righteousness of God as your faith increases your understanding will increase but you'll never exhaust the genius of God in righteousness and exploring the reality of the gospel it's there it's contained in the dynamic of that historic episode of a son sent to suffer and die and be raised again by the power and the glory of God the father and established for ever the atonement of all mankind we're we're we're facing the most formidable opponent because the gospel that Paul even says in Romans they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake why because they're so formidable it compels you to come to a place in God adequate to meeting that formidable challenge and therefore the grace of the Holy Spirit is probably the primary provision of God in that encounter there is a real conjunction between the spirit poured out from heaven and the commandment of the Lord through his church all of the art has given me in heaven and earth go you therefore to all the world preach this gospel every creature beginning at truest them the place where I was crucified the place where the prophets of stone dare you begin you don't first try it out and see if it works in the in the boondocks go to Bemidji first and then you from there you can go to New York no you go to New York begin with the opposition will be the severest but I've given you every grace with the fullness of my spirit that is not a Pentecostal luxury it's an endowment for power and ability in that mandate that I'm giving you that you cannot fulfill on the basis of your own religiosity and well-meaning intention you can only fulfill it on the basis of me I know most people I don't know I didn't know ministry before I received the baptism of spirit and you may have did you notice a marked difference in your ministry and the anointing and the things that the Lord would have you do yeah I did the first of the night of my baptism I'll always remember driving back from northern California Oakland was a teacher we came alongside another car for a few moments and it was occupied by two black men I always remember the image there was a pack of Marlboro cigarettes on the dashboard and these two men were chatting with it and I just looked like this for a moment and a wave of compassion came over me for these men what they represented what the Marlboro cigarettes represented their lostness their alienation from God what it means to be black in our world today like a wave of something that came with that baptism the second thing that I observed that is factual to this day is the spirit of revelation and the word that the word just opens today's psalm whatever it is there's a something operating of a revelatory kind that came with that baptism that was not operative before and who knows the other benefits I talked about speaking at universities that began at the University of Illinois at Champaign where I was for seven days the principal speaker and they put up these stickers all over the campus cats is coming has one word no space in between and when I came and I arrived and I saw that I was terrified that I'm the guy but what God did in those days was awesome one meeting in particular I was the meeting four to six meetings a day I was spent I was exhausted my brain was numb I couldn't think of in my own name and I'm being taken by the hand from the philosophy class to a Jewish fraternity house or another classroom or wherever it is that they have arranged the meeting and I'm praying in the spirit under my breath in the few minutes I'm going from this commitment to the next when I come to the next commitment devoid of any thought of what to speak and I open my mouth there's a profusion of spirit activated words that engage if not not agonize antagonized my ears and into that atmosphere comes this Vietnamese veteran cracked out on drugs and falls to the ground to the floor and listens as the students then began to oppose me after I finished my little message questions and answers and he gets up and he says what are you guys doing he said opposing this man can't you see that he said that God is here that man Tom Bloomer is today one of the leaders of youth with a mission in Lausanne Switzerland who arranged the program by which for five days I spoke on the subject of apostolic foundations the book that we have today now in German and Bulgarian and one day in other languages remarkable in its richness had its first expression from Tom Bloomer in Lausanne who was saved at that meeting and went on to the remarkable position that he occupies today and I would say if I had not spoken in tongues under my breath being taken from the one meeting to that meeting he would have heard and received something less something less compelling and it may have been the issue of his salvation there's no way to exaggerate the importance of the baptism of the spirit and the remarkable refillings and renewings in its power as often as we will give God our voice and faith in the language which he has given by which the spirit itself is carried and renewed through our being and the issue of the jew makes that prominent it's interesting that I was called out of the teaching profession to be taken into a mission to the jews that was baptistic in its origin and to this day and after four years I was forced out of that organization by those members who resented the fact that I was the only Pentecostal missionary in that organization and the only reason I was was because Moish Rosen wanted to tap the resources of the Pentecostal churches and knew that the mission needed to have at least one man in its midst who was recognized Pentecostal and that mission today continues but with very little fruit in fact Jewish missions are one of the patent failures of missionary endeavor in the world and that the their fruit is always of the peripheral jew more jews are saved independent of the church let alone missions than by missions because they still are at a distance from this reality of the baptism of the Holy Spirit which they have set aside as being the distinctive only of Pentecostals or Charismatics and don't see their own need in light of this revelation of the righteousness of God uh acting in mercy towards the jew and the gentiles it gives us a barometer for how what brightness righteousness we're acting out of because self-righteousness will react in a form of judgment towards others rather than a form of mercy so if we're walking in God's righteousness his righteousness is being flowing out of us by the gift of the Holy Spirit we won't try to click take the speck out of somebody else's eye good we'll love them and we'll show them the mercy of God and God will give us a way to pierce their heart amen what a paradox to come to the jews on the same basis by which jews themselves subsist namely their own self-righteousness only we come out of the christian form of it no we have got to come to them from heaven we have got to represent the antithesis of all to which they subscribe which they dismiss as patent foolishness and absurdity and weakness but in that weakness God's strength is revealed from faith to faith. I can't help by backing up into verse 16 again for I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God yeah the gospel itself is the death blow to the old man it should be the true gospel but it hasn't been in our you know experience but it should be the death blow to the old man so the power of God is weakness and foolishness and that is the thing that reveals righteousness and that brings us you know from faith to faith leading on continuing to faith that's the essence of our salvation is the power and the weakness that that comes in Christ living in us which is the death blow to the old man we mustn't neglect the aspect of salvation that was celebrated by a swedish theologian in a book called Christus Victus Christ the victor that the principle heart of the gospel is not only the salvation of men but the defeat of the powers of darkness because at the cross Jesus made of them an open spectacle and disarmed them so that the defeat to the enemy to the devil and say he said I've come to destroy the works of the devil now has the judgment come now will the prince of this world be confronted so there's a cosmic dimension to the gospel that needs to be considered and not forgotten that in it the powers of darkness are dealt with and their wisdom is contradicted which celebrates power prestige wealth and all these things and it's met and defeated by the foolishness of the weakness by which Jesus was crucified he was crucified in weakness and yet in that crucifixion the powers were defeated that's why Paul says in first corinthians had they known they would not have crucified the lord of glory they would not have earned their own defeat by what they thought they were eliminating because in exercising their wisdom which is power and force unto death they brought unnecessary death that eventuated in a resurrection and the atonement of all mankind and the final and utter defeat through the church birthed through that atonement so this what's involved in that wisdom of God is manifold that's why we're taking it apart we're trying to examine in it is the wisdom of God revealed from faith to faith and we're even growing in faith today by the word and the exposition to show the ramifications of what is in this single episode that is the great moment in the whole of world history the crucifixion of Jesus the son of God sent for that purpose okay in terms of the cross i've been thinking for the last few minutes um that its demonstration is the ultimate demonstration of righteousness and in terms of the church in Israel and the reciprocal relationship and the cutting off and the grafting in i hadn't considered this and this is my heresy for the day um i wonder if that demonstration of the cutting in and the reciprocal relationship was first demonstrated in the trinity when Jesus was cut off and made unrighteousness he was cut off and then he was brought back in by God the father's righteousness and i had never never seen that before think of the whole basic thing God is visiting a ruined creation through the fall a terrible tragedy has taken place with fall the whole of creation has been submitted over to the evil one and suffers now defilement and corruption and God now is addressing that lost cosmos by the sending of his son and affecting a redemption through his blood how righteous of God even to give his creation a second thought after it has blown it and disfigured the glory of what he had given at the first but instead of allowing them to wallow in that corruption and defilement which is adamic and unavoidable he sends a second atom who is his own son and very God himself to bear the righteous requirement of its redemption through a life unto a given over unto death that willingness and that jealousy over his own creation and the lengths to which he will go to redeem it is a statement of the righteousness of God what a righteous God we have who will not abandon us to our own adamic fall to which we are all given and all have subscribed and all are guilty so without qualification why were we yet sinners God loved us he didn't wait for some thing from us he took the initiative while we were yet sinners to to set in motion our redemption at the cost of himself and last night i was reading where the writer says what did it cost the father Jesus we know suffered but did the father suffer or was he looked was he looking down from a kind of olympian height and a kind of neutrality and saying too bad but my son has got to go through this there's no shortcut or was he suffering a grief and so the writer says he was suffering divine grief that was accentuated at the point where his son cried out my God my God why hast thou forsaken me and everything in his father's heart would have yearned to be with his son and at his side and save him from that abandonment but he could not it was necessary in the very process of atonement that Jesus bears sin and know that sin alienates from God and that the forsakenness was part of that experience but the grief that a father bears picture your own kids crying out to you dad i'm suffering from something from which you can extricate me help me now and you cannot and your your heart is torn by every fatherly impulse of love to extend that aid but to extend it is to defeat the greater purpose for your son and the purpose through your son so you bear the grief so the father is not exempt from the suffering of the cross he so to speak is crucified with his son that's righteousness you guys i i like a God like that this is not a God who sent his son to do the dirty work and he'll wait for him to return this is a God who's with his son in that sending what did it cost the father to send the son he's not sending him off to college and here's your allowance i'll see you you know in the spring break i'm sending you into this vile world that hates me i'm sending you into a fallen world and you're going to be its victim ultimately you're going to be rejected even by my chosen you're going to suffer indignity and at the hands of men unbelievable travesty and violence i'm sending you you think that that God could send his son like that without a sense of grief without a sense of loss without a sense of the brokenness of a relationship that they've been joined together since time immemorial that has now to be ruptured because the son must be sent into the world we have not calculated what it has cost God to establish his so great redemption but every aspect of that cost and his willingness to bear it is the statement of the righteousness of God our God is righteous this is what righteousness is and we would not have seen it if he had not performed it and we'll see it to the degree of our faith from faith to faith and even that is a grace that we can see it so let me let me read the work of a theologian who's pondering all this the reason that the gospel is revealed a righteousness of God needs to be observed needs to be observed how the concepts originate even from the old testament itself because there we find the conjunction of salvation and righteousness again and again oh sing unto the lord a new song for you have done marvelous things his right hand is holding on hath brought salvation for him the lord has made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly showed and the sight of the nation psalm 98 isaiah 46 i will bring near my righteousness you shall not be far off and my salvation should not carry i will place salvation in zion for Israel my glory isaiah 51 my righteousness is near my salvation has gone forth my salvation shall be forever my righteousness shall not be abolished my righteousness shall be forever and my salvation from generation to generation so again and again in the old testament there's a remarkable conjunction between righteousness and salvation to the point where you can almost say righteousness is salvation and salvation is righteousness God really ever refers to salvation independent of the word righteousness but because what is salvation in last analysis it brings to the unrighteous the righteousness of God that we who knew no sin that he who knew no sin became sin that we who did not know the righteousness of God could become the righteousness of God salvation is becoming the righteousness of God and what a righteousness that is where else would kit katz be today without it i'd be dead long ago or i'd be i don't know what i only want to consider the possibilities i'm saved by the righteousness of God for righteousness it's a gift and there's a difference between God's righteousness and human righteousness because the jew was unwilling to relinquish his human and religious righteousness to receive the righteousness which is of God it's not an issue of a degree it's an issue of a kind the righteousness of God is other than the righteousness of man God's concern is not only against evil and wickedness it's against righteousness of man which in the last analysis is wicked how do you know that cats because the righteousness of man crucified christ yeah who are the who are the the instrumentalities roman law lexus what is it romans roman romanis nexus nexus the law of rome was the the the foundation of order in the in the ancient world roman law the jurisdiction the concepts even are active today in our own legal practices in conjunction with whom the religion of Israel the highest form of monotheism in its most liturgical and sacramental beauty were the joined forces that conspired together to execute the lord of glory and to destroy the righteousness of God in the keeping of their own righteousness men will kill to preserve their own righteousness is that remarkable so do we esteem the righteousness of God or are we more jewish than we know are we more judaic than we know that we've allowed the righteousness of God to lapse in our consciousness and that we have more and more moved in a religious way into a righteousness of our own which is no longer the righteousness of God but a religious counterfeit very much like judaism while we're yet christians do you love the righteousness of God so much as to dismiss your own why is that an issue for you as well as for the jew because self-righteousness is the foundation of self-esteem we want to be recognized for our merit and that which we perform and what we are capable but to be emptied of those distinctions and all that we have as barren nothings who are mirrors dust is what God imputes by faith who's willing for that and what if he doesn't impute what if your face is sticking out at a critical moment and you have nothing to say and are able to do because you have a covenant with God that you would not again return to the pitiful rags of your own self-life and he's taking you at your word and here comes a crisis situation where you're facing a rabbi or your own jewish kinsman or or black africans and of God be not God and there's no resurrection you are most men but most to be pitied to trust God for his resurrection power and word is to trust God for his righteousness and to be righteousness in your trust got the idea this righteousness is not a little flaky issue it's a current moment by moment issue whether we will abide in the righteousness of God and be blameless before him which is why he said to abraham abraham walk thou before me and be thou blameless i'm God almighty and i've said this before many times why does he conjure the conjunction of the command to walk and be blameless and be righteous and i'm God almighty because the only basis upon which you can't be blameless is upon me not on your own abrahamic life you dear sap because on that basis you went down to egypt and offered your wife up as a piece of uh entertainment for the uh for the court an object of their uh egyptian lust you big shot you father of faith so i'm imputing righteousness to you because you have none and you're the father of that faith for many who will have it as you have obtained it my faith as it is imputed by the God who is alone righteous have you guys come to this ground or you're still fighting kicking against the pricks wanting to establish yourself on the basis of your own righteousness your own performance your own ability so why did Jesus say to put to john the baptist who denied him and was astonished that he should request baptism where he needs i need more to be baptized at your because it fulfills all righteousness that word comes up again why so that Jesus would go into the muck of that river and be established identification himself as if he were himself a sinner with his nation or he cannot be to them a priest and a savior righteousness required his immersion in their guilt and sin that's righteousness and when the father saw that isn't all this is my beloved son this is my boy he's really showing me forth this this is what i am as God but i could never persuade men about it until my son himself actually demonstrates it that's why what he does is righteousness that's why the gospel is righteousness what Jesus explicated and performed at the cross is righteousness and that's the gospel and how shall we be in eternal fellowship with him except that we share a his nature which is righteous so that's a salvation to the uttermost and a preparation for an eternal fellowship with a God who abides in that character because that's what he is in himself the righteousness of God is not an affectation it's not a put-on it's not a punctuation it's what he is in himself that's why i'm so grateful for this God we could have had any kind of tyrant for God and we would have no choice in the matter but what we got miraculously is a God who's righteous and has demonstrated that at great cost to himself and his righteousness is his continuing patience with us with sons who are sluggish who are not active who will not thank him will not praise him will drift and coast and not come into the act of appropriation of their call a church that has not been obedient to his mandate though he has said to the jew first and we have historically circumvented him and turned away from that obligation and there's a God who's yet there yet patient yet pressing yet faithful and will have his his church at the end he's righteous in everything remarkable or how else should we have known it if we don't know the righteousness of God we'll only know the righteousness of the pharisee which is self-righteousness which is self-serving and when you get to the heart of it however altruistic it may seem at its place and philanthropic and in the last it's self-serving it's for man his gratification men would recognize and compliment him but the righteousness of God is not in any way clouded or contradicted or compromised by any such consideration it is always totally for the consideration of the other nothing that redounds to God that he needs for to be exalted in his ego that's righteousness a righteousness that is pure from self-interest otherwise the other kind of righteousness however zealous will bring you to the place of the persecutor and the murderer which was what saul himself became before he became Paul saul is the epitome of religious self-righteousness brought to its final point of expression where it finds itself opposing God and killing in God's name God's own people so that when he's confronted by the risen lord the statement is so-so why for persecutors thou me so that the man in one stunning blinding moment that that in fact leaves him blind and as good as dead for three days before a simple saint lance lays hands upon him recognizes that his zeal his righteous religious zeal the logic and the ultimate end of it was to be a murderer against God's own people which is to say against God himself that's the end of human righteousness and Paul had to feed it to the end have you known the joy of righteousness have you ever experienced the exhilarating delight of being righteous in God of the righteousness of God have you ever been cleaned through the whole cookie have you ever had a conscience undefiled before God and before man have you ever been pure from taint and from sin and the blood has abolished and you're walking consistently in the life of God and in his righteousness and tasted that as joy i can't say that this is my every moment but i can say that in the few moments that have come to me it has always been accompanied by a sense of such joy such inward exhilaration such delight that you would not exchange that for anything let the most luscious babe cross your path and offer herself at abandon you're completely indifferent nothing no temptation can begin to move you once you have tasted the joy of the righteousness of God as an incentive to keep in that righteousness and i was i would suspect that the fallenness of our ministers which is of plague proportions is that they have not known it and have not known the gospel and have only superficially been inducted in the few catchwords pertaining to it and therefore made themselves candidates for temptation and falling from which alone the righteousness of God and the joy of that righteousness would have kept them to look at the righteousness of God who will not give us a blessing that is just a superficial feeling and emotive kind of thing but roots his blessing in righteousness for our sake that we would not be pacified by some transient little catch thing but that we would be impelled to find our blessedness in his righteousness and so this is the love of a father who is not willing for a cheapy alternative but however long the the process takes he's insistent on the right on the real thing he's insistent on his righteousness and will give us every encouragement to attain it but will not divert us by a cheapy substitute which he could give and the way we give as far here's an allowance here's to your wife go buy a hat go to the movies but we won't deal with the issue that really needs to be faced that's painful and that will really be peace righteousness and joy because we have not the heart of a father and we want an easy out that relieves the momentary tension of the difficulty that we can buy off with a few bucks or a little gesture and an easy thing God is not that kind of God he's righteous and his truth and redemption is real and he insists on it and we praise God for that what is our worship if it is not the thing that issues from us out of the joy of the righteousness which is the gift of God by faith what is our worship that affects a joy that is that does not have this as its nexus and auspices but a solish counterfeit that we can obtain through musicality and voices that's unrighteous that's unrighteous worship which is more the affecting of an atmosphere for our enjoyment than giving God his due and our gratitude for the gift of righteousness it would be unrighteous for us to pursue that and to dispossess God from the thing the real thing out of which worship should issue which is the current practice of the church today grievously and celebrated for that reason that they have the better worship what they mean is the better music but worship that doesn't issue out from righteousness and joy and the gratitude for its gift is not a true acknowledgement to the lord so you see the implications of righteousness in the church's very practices that needs to be corrected by someone coming in prophetic authority and voice and blowing the whistle against a fraudulent counterfeit and shutting it off and bringing and waiting for the true thing that issues only out of righteousness and that very prophetic interjection is itself righteous though it will not be misunderstood and will be dismissed as being unrighteous as disturbing the program so the issue of righteousness is before us because the joy of the lord is our strength but it's not a fictitious joy it's a joy of a unique kind that issues out of this kingdom reality so may we be jealous because of the instruction of today for that righteousness and its implications which are is also our strength and our power for the joy of the lord is our strength but it's the joy of the lord that comes from the righteousness of the lord in fact what does not come from the lord and any setting of the lord aside by any self-initiated thing of ourselves is unrighteous in the face of a God who is righteous in his giving he who gave us his son will he not give us all things through him what will he withhold from us who has already given us his son an atonement he'll give us all things that pertain to Godliness of the life for us to void that and to initiate something out of ourselves as substitute like worship is unrighteous robs us of joy robs us of strength robs us of witness and leaves the jews in their present condition totally unchallenged for which God waits for they are at the heart of the kingdom promised them God has set a standard he himself is that standard for us to elaborate a human standard based on our ethical premises or subjective experience is the height of unrighteousness and that's exactly what judaism is contemptuous of the goyim the gentiles who don't have their practices and follow the fastidious requirements of the law see to me and look down with contempt at disdain why does it wait for us to be prostitutes or drug dealers or tax collectors to come to that acknowledgement why aren't we all equally as grateful for so great salvation that has brought us up out of the mire as those who sin is so ostensible and conspicuous you know why because we don't think we're that bad we don't really believe that we are sinners saved by grace and that our sin is as grievous as a righteous man as the prostitute or the gambler or the drunkard we have not the concept of sin which will be our soon subject maybe even tomorrow without which righteousness does not really obtain distinction so these are the foundation excuse me the foundations that need to be restored or laid we have not the knowledge of sin apostolically as being the exceeding sinfulness of sin that we might with gratitude understand the exceeding righteousness of God that has saved us out of that condition and continues to save by being our righteousness so let's thank the lord we're on a remarkable symphonic thing here that God is sounding and we need to pause and give him praise for this much amen so lord thank you lord as you go on my God we're little we're getting some sneaky suspicion about our unrighteousness even as christians so my God receive our gratitude lord you're so good thank you my God for your righteous answer to a despairing servant of which we have all been beneficiaries thank you my God and may we all be encouraged for we will have moments like that in which there's a sense of abandonment and despair and a sense of defeat and and the dampening of our hearts and this heaviness my God that is unbearable which will allow us to to suffer because out of that suffering issues of glory and we've seen the portion of it today and we thank you give you the praise and glory in Jesus name
