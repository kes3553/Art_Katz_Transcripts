DVD 01 - The Gospel Versus Interfaith Relations by Art Katz - Art Katz

We see the beauty of their lives, and their character, and their integrity. And we hear them speak their many languages, and see their intensity, and their passion, and their character, and their nature.

And our hearts covet them for the Kingdom of God, that they might be an end-time people of God, proclaiming a salvation throughout the earth.

The issue of history. Which is the issue of tradition. We read a paper, composed early this morning. It's very inadequate. I have more time than my width about me. It will be more extensive, but... This will be some expression of what I'm going to do. I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. It will be more extensive, but...

This will be some expression of my response to things that have been expressed through love, and it has presentations to us, centering an interfaith relationship, which has every sound of something to be desired. But I hope to indicate that I think that, in essence, it's deadly to everything that's apostolic. So I'm writing, interfaith relationship is predicated upon and requires not only a respect, but the acknowledgement of the validity of rabbinical Judaism as being equal to or comparable to that of Christianity. This is, in my opinion, a deadly condescension that in one fell swoop destroys the apostolic foundations of the one faith that is alone the basis and provision for the one God for the redemption of mankind and that of Israel itself. It destroys the faith that is the faith.

The world talks about the three great faiths. I've never acknowledged three great faiths.

There's only one great faith, any faith left that is devious, deceptive, a distraction, an alternative that has its ardor from below rather than above. So, Christian faith is not another competitive alternative to other faith busters whose tenets are as deserving of respect. But the one redemptive act of God whose proclamation to the ends of the earth make the cycle of all nations, we are enjoined to obey with signs and wonders following.

Go you into all the world and proclaim this gospel to all creatures. Those that believe and are baptized shall be saved. Those who believe shall perish. That language now sounds so antique, so archaic. More than that, it sounds offensive.

One of the great scandals of the faith is the absoluteness on the insistence of that solitary message as if there were no other. Go you into all the world and that's why the North American Indian, if he embraces Christianity, is accused of embracing white man's religion or the Jew would become gentileized. It's as if who dare has the presumption to think that your faith is the only and absolute standard to which all mankind is to subscribe.

Well, that's just the name of the game. Sorry about that.

I myself was offended when I picked up a New Testament for the first time in my 34th year and read of a Jesus who said, no man comes to the Father but by me.

If any man comes any lower, he's a thief and a robber. Hey, that's running right across the grain of my whole relativistic upbringing, many paths to truth. It sounds so honorific. Everything has its own distinction and appropriate one way. One man, one faith, one salvation.

Now, the whole of our present civilization is antithetical to the absolute insistence of God in one way.

The question is, are we uncomfortable with that?

Are we aware of how much that jangles the nerves of the world and how impolite to insist upon Jews that they should somehow subscribe to our core Christian faith as if it's one of three or other faiths deserving of equal consideration?

A pox of democracy, if you will.

So this uncompromising absoluteness is integral to the whole apostolic character of the faith from its inception, though it is today embarrassingly out of place in the pluralism of a relativistic world of, quote, many paths to truth. If the apostolic faith is not absolute, it's not apostolic.

There's an absoluteness and insistence, a singularity. I'll touch this as I go on.

So this is embarrassingly out of place in the pluralism of a relativistic world of many paths to truth.

I believe that we ourselves have opened the door.

That is, Christianity in its present disposition, particularly in its interfaith mentality, has opened the door to this destructive pluralism that neither Jesus nor Paul were for a moment of continence by our condescension to the Christ-rejecting Jewish community, whose Judaism was birthed out of the rejection of the crucified one and the atonement obtained through his death.

So this sounds on the face of it like a very hard indictment against Judaism.

It's only stating the facts, John, that present rabbinical Judaism was born out of the rejection of the Christ event, followed by the destruction of the temple, and the priesthood and sacrifice that constitute the foundation of the then biblical Judaism. So that we have opened the door, once we have acknowledged the validity of any other faith, we have opened the door to a plurality of faiths, and the whole world now is ridden with these faiths, all contending, all claiming their right to contend one with the other, as if they have valid grounds.

There's only one valid ground. That's the presumption of our faith, and it's more than an embarrassment.

It's a ground for persecution of the atonement obtained through his death, unwilling and unable to recognize it, the Gentile centurion, that this is the Son of God. Remember that acknowledgement, this professional murderer, watching this man on the cross, dying with such a magnanimity, forgiving his murderers, that they not descend to their charge, forgive them, they know not what they do.

This is the Son of God.

Something was revealed of the ultimate nature of that victim to forge a confession and acknowledgement out of a Gentile centurion that the nation of Israel was unwilling or unable to make, except for the numbers that became believers. And following that, by bribing those who guarded the tomb to tell the story that his body had been stolen by his disciples, denying the testimony and power and miracles of the post-Pentecost church, which used him to corroborate the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, prophesied by Jesus that took place in 70 A.D.

It's a system predicated upon repentance.

This was the new innovation in Yafna, in that city, by a particular rabbi who was celebrated as being the founder of the presence of biblical Judaism, predicated on repentance.

And as I wrote that somewhere about 4 or 5 a.m. this morning, I put the word sick, S-I-C in parentheses, after the word repentance, which means what?

It's predicated on repentance, and you've watched the crucifixion of the Son of God, very God, and have dismissed that, and you saw to it that a guard was put among his tomb because there was the outrageous possibility that his body would be stolen and that the mischief of his disappearance would be worse than what began it, and yet his body was not in the tomb.

And we know what happened.

There was a resurrection in power, and the remarkable paintings of these Roman guards being disheveled, the helmets falling off their heads being cast in every direction, and the power by which Jesus was wasting his death by the glory of God the Father.

Well, they went and told the story.

And they were bribed by the authorities, the Jewish authorities, to say that his disciples came back and stole his body. And then the Gospel says, and this account is believed to this day. I'm just going back and reviewing the melancholy elements that led to the rejection of Jesus and the formation of the present Judaism with which we hope to be in some kind of constructive interfaith dialogue.

With whom are you dialoguing?

You're dialoguing with the descendants who refused the testimony of Jesus.

If you'll not believe that I am here, you shall die in your sins.

Who refused to receive the testimony of the centurion, though they had as much opportunity to see the glory of God revealed in the ultimate suffering and death of the Son of God. And then the lost body that they knew was resurrected because these guards gave the true account of what happened.

Well, you say this here after, and they bribe them. When I read that, I'm staggered. If ever men had an opportunity to repent and say, boy, we really missed it.

We thought this guy was a presumer and that his miracles were some kind of magic and he was leading Israel astray down another path contrary to what we understood Judaism to be. But now that he has been resurrected by the power of God the Father, this evidently is the statement of Father's approval for what was performed at the cross through him.

And we've got to go back to square one to the drawing board and acknowledge repentantly before the nation. We have missed it and have been even the perpetrators of his death.

But instead of that, they swallowed down the evidence of the resurrection, blinded the guards who tell another story. And of course, the veil that was rent from top to bottom by the power of God when Jesus gave up his ghost, which I think I say was nine inches thick, had to be sewn together so that they could continue in their normative practices until the temple itself was destroyed according to the prophecy of Jesus.

Forty years later, forty being the number of judgments. This is a remarkable indictment of that generation.

But the point that I'm making is that that whole rejection constitutes the foundation of what's today called normative Judaism with whom we hope to be in some kind of constructive dialogue.

Now, what a lot to be really laying it on its drum. And this sounds like it has all of the earmarks of anti-Semitic indictment. No, the truth can be born in another way. It doesn't have to be an incentive for anger and rotation. Jesus said they don't know what they do.

But now that we know in order to affect the way in which we relate to them, not bristling with anger and indignation, but a greater heart of compassion for the tragedy that was ensued by the rejection of him whom God the Father sent.

And so it gives us a different handle, a different disposition in our relatedness with them.

So we're not condescending that they have a faith, however time honored, and attended by the sages of Israel and the commentaries of values.

I know how beguiling and impressive that weight of tradition is. I'm now being faced with it for the first time in my Jewish life in my 74th year with a wonderful rabbi. And Mark and I went to a session at the Lubbock's Procedure in the Groponauer, and Joshua gave at the beginning an insight of the things that were being shared.

Nevertheless, despite the impressiveness of the erudition, intellectuality, scholarship that marks this Jewish people, we have to recognize the group fact of the one event that has come in point of time.

And once it has come, everything is changed.

Nothing can after that be honored that refuses to acknowledge, recognize, and make that the predicate of all faith reality. To ignore that and then found a Judaism on repentance and good works and mitzvot is a flight from reality. You're going to have a Judaism based on repentance and not repent of your repentance.

What kind of repentance is that? That's then only religious, that's only play acting, that's only unreality.

And you're condemning generations to an alternative to God's redemptive provision and consigning them to perdition.

Well, what could be a substitute for the blood of the lamb? What kind of religious practice? What kind of good deeds? What deeds can be good?

That issue for men who are not good and can only be made good in Messiah alone, for God alone is good. So there's a whole ideological conflict of a fundamental kind that if we do not face it and bring it up as issue, we do them the service and consign this generation to the same perdition to which generations have preceded them because they go into death not believing.

If you'll not believe that I be, you shall die in your sins. I know what that means, but I shudder only to quote it. And evidently God knows what it means and thought it so significant that he didn't spare my mother after 38 and 39 years of resisting me to my teeth.

So we brought before her every saint who was ever across these grounds and she heard and saw everything that should have been sufficient to win her acceptance of the Lord.

She was a stubborn Jewish holdout till 10 days before her death. Nothing that we could say, demonstrate or plead could ever persuade her. Her son was transformed before her sight. The world was coming to this door. Her son was being honored in nations around the world, but my mother was unwilling to bend, acknowledge, or concede until she was given a vision of hell. I don't know if you got that when Crystal was sharing the other night. My mother was terrified, stark terror. The Lord did not spare her. So much so she was beside herself in her frenzy there and I had to be called at 2 or 3 in the morning to come down to my mother's bedside. And in 20 minutes she was falling in her prayer to seek the Lord, like taking candy from the proverbial baby.

What happened to that backbone of Jewish resistance and stubborn opposition that could not even name the name of Christ?

I'm taking my hand and following the Lord's word in a prayer to receive Jesus as the Savior. Not by any expertise of mine or the daughter of the Lord.

It was the Lord who out of fear and terror in anticipation of an eternal hell was willing to consider and even to speak that name in which he had grown so hot as to not even be able to utter it.

And the moment she spoke it, whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. The Lord did for her what he did for me. Hey, I could no more get the name of Jesus out of my mouth 38 years ago. And she was able in her 96th year to do. We were so schooled against that name. And the only way it could be spoken even passively was blasphemously. To call upon that name with any kind of respect and reverence was actually beyond our ability to do. Do you know that it's a grace to call upon the name of the Lord? Do you think it's a vocalization that anyone could perform that will? That's how little you know.

It's a grace to call upon the name of the Lord as I saw it performed through my mother and through myself.

It was given. Without faith of our own, it's a gift lest any man impose.

And that this new foundation of rabbinical Judaism, synagogue attendance, prayer, good deeds, as determined by rabbis, is supposed to be an acceptable alternative to the liturgical requirement for the shedding of blood in the absence of temple, priesthood, and sacrifice. What Jesus prophesied took place, the temple was destroyed, the Muslim was destroyed, the priesthood dispersed, even the records of the priesthood. So there could not even be a resuscitation of priesthood because it was dispersed in God.

And this withered the ability to perform sacrifice. That was a tragic impasse that requires one kind of radical response from another.

We have to rethink about this Jesus who led at the cross the lamb of God without spot, who gave himself by the eternal spirit. Or you have to find some kind of cunning equivalent and assume that God finds it acceptable.

Because if he doesn't, you're an eternally dead duck.

So the millions have followed this, have been sent into eternal tradition, and its perpetrators, not willing themselves to enter, have kept back generations by their continuing hostility to the gospel.

I'm paraphrasing that famous scripture. Not willing themselves to enter, they prevented others from entering.

Any condescension to the above necessarily diminished the apostolic distinctives of insistence on the singularity of the church's message, its absoluteness and urgency. A church that is not urgent is not the church. A church that lacks apostolic absoluteness about the primacy of its message is not apostolic.

To lose that distinction and that urgency and that insistence is to lose the church as the church. That's what I'm saying by that.

We're risking very great loss in this ecumenical dialogue and interfaith relationship with the church community because of necessity it brings a toning down and an equivocation, a compromise from the absoluteness that is intrinsic to true faith. A church that has become bland and nondescript ironically must fail the Jewish people itself and its mandate to them and bring corresponding loss to the Greek by a diminished gospel which by its very nature is always a divinely calculated scandal and offense.

We prayed about that this morning.

And even thank God the gospel is an offense and it is a scandal and not an easy to communicate message that does not commend itself to human intellect. It's as if God has gone out of his way purposely to calculate a message of such a kind that no man can entertain or receive on the basis of his own intelligence.

It defies every human thing by which men can endorse something.

It can only come as a gift, an understanding and part of my revelation in conjunction with the unsparing and uncompromising word of its absoluteness. But if we bring an equivocating word by which we retreat either in content or in tone the spirit of God and the anointing of God will not be there to bless.

It will bounce off our hero like a nice video. You'll bring that on a nice video. You're happy? Good. It will not be the kind of message like oh, it's me, I'm undone.

God anoints 40 points but he's not going to anoint a deluded message that has suffered compromise in order to find some kind of accommodation, acquiescence with our Jewish consultant.

If we really love them, we'll not spare them. And we'll not spare ourselves because you don't know the Gospel.

You cannot know it in its character and its shameful, scandalous nature until you bring it to a Jew.

Likely did a Jewish theologian, Jacob Yosh, J-O-C-Z, whose brother Gates, the Anglicized name, married to him in Oakland, California.

And in one of his books, I think, Jesus and Judaism, he says nothing reveals the radical character of the Gospel than bringing it to the Jew.

And this was God's intention. To the Jew first. Before you go anyplace else, begin in Jerusalem, Samaritan, begin with the Jew first. Come and bring the message of my birth, my divine origin, my coming down from heaven, my laying aside, my deity, my 30 years of obscurity, my three and a half year public ministry, my rejection, my crucifixion, my suffering, my death, my resurrection, my ascension, my seated on the right hand with glory. And begin it with the same people who crucified me. Begin in the same city where the prophets were stoned. Don't take it to Connecticut first, but the little places in the country and see if you can hoist that flag up or if it will go over, the way Broadway productions are first begun in Connecticut and go down in places. And then if they find some super-demon, then they'll bring it to Broadway. No glasses, begin at Broadway. Begin where I was crucified.

So our respect for, even our admiration for Judaism's erudition, scholarship, gentility, and charm, even the unrecognized desire for the approval of the Jewish community has resulted in incalculable loss to the purity, authority, and power of contemporary Christianity. Of course, poltergeists and the Jewish community, have lost to the purity, authority, and power of contemporary Christianity. Because Paul was not ashamed of this gospel, what would be a scandal, for it is the very power of God and the salvation to the Jew first and also to the Greek. We are diminishing what the Greek gets if we have that God to the Jew first. This is not an invitation in saying all these things to resume again the unhappy, if not tragic, triumphalism and arrogant disdain of the early churches of the Jewish community.

Do we get mad at them now and put a number on them?

This is what has been implied or actually stated in these days, that the only alternative to speaking this kind of hard truth is to be gentle, to understand the cross-cultural elements and function in a kind of interfaith dialogue. As if the only alternative to interfaith dialogue is to lapse again into kind of harshness and triumphalism and arrogance that characterize the church of previous generations.

I'm saying no. I'm saying no.

We need every lesson that we've been given these days on how to understand our Jewish kinsmen and how to speak in a right way and knowingly, but not sparingly.

The spare is to allow to destroy. The love is to take the risks of offense and even of rejection. But to placate, condescend, that one scene in the film that we saw that pierced me through was this Irish rabbi, Rosen, I'll never forget it, with his Van Dyke beard and real, evident assurance of having it all together, polished in her vein. I don't need a mediator. I already have a relationship with God. And then another reference to the Messiah.

Well, whatever the issue is of who the Messiah is, it in no way diminishes what I already have as a relationship with God. Well, can you have that when Jesus said, no man comes to the Father but by me?

How then can you have a relationship? One of two things is right.

Either your relationship is more imagined than it is real or our confidence in what Jesus said needs to be reconsidered. There's an absoluteness in the gospel that says you cannot come. No man can come to the Father, to me, except the Father who I am.

There's an absolute clarity in that word.

So what do you do when a rabbi who gives every appearance, not only civility, not only erudition, but a moral tone to his life that just makes us gasp and look up at admiration, says that he has a relationship with God, that our knowledge of New Testament scripture says he cannot have?

Reference to the commandment.

Either we're wrong in our assumption predicated in the New Testament verses out of the very mouth of Jesus and that he has it without Jesus, that means the gospel itself has an irrelevancy not only for Jews but for anyone. Or this man is deceived and thinks that his culture and refinement and efficacy is somehow a relationship with God.

He cannot know about his birth.

So what do we do when with the presence of a Jew like that he makes a statement and we are silent?

Our silence is validating that statement. Our silence is implying, yes, we are in agreement with your contention that you have such relationship.

What we really ought to do if we love the man is to say, I'm sorry, dear sir, I don't care what your subjective impression may be, but if the scriptures and the New Testament out of the mouth of Jesus themselves mean true, it's impossible for you to enjoy the relationship in which you're boasting.

You're a deceived man, or we're deceived, but we're not going to be silent so as to condone and validate your presumption.

And you're the spiritual leader of the Jewish community and communicating that and encouraging others to seek kind of assumed relationship that cannot exist short of the acknowledgement of the blood and the forgiveness of sins.

For my arm is not shortened, that it cannot save, nor is my ear dulled, that it cannot hear. But your sins, God says, have separated you from me.

What greater sin than the sin of presumption and the spiritual quiet that boasts a relationship that is non-existent and puts greater confidence in the subjectivity of one's feeling than in the stated word of God, the Son of God, who alone is righteous and not a man that he should lie.

Are you all listening to me? Yes, yes. There's a conflict here, there's something struck, and it's not happenstance or inadvertent. It's absolutely calculated by God from the beginning. We're joined into a remarkable issue with the Jewish community. How we relate to them in that issue is the issue, is the whole thing that we're about in these days, without which the age is concluded.

So, do we move in the direction of interfaith dialogue and acknowledgement and endorsement that you guys may not have Jesus, but what you do have is impressive and we don't want to be ungainly and be a sore thumb, the blood in the China shop, but the thing that you have to share with Jesus, all the more, when in his name you have suffered persecution for 2,000 years?

What kind of love is that? What kind of respect is that? Would you back off and not be insistent on your gospel? Many paths to truth, or is there one path?

And if we buckle before the Jew in their seeming civility and refinement, as if they had no need of that path, we're opening the doors for many paths, none of which lead to heaven and all of which lead to perdition, which Satan is quite handy to provide for the deceived millions in the world.

The issue of the Jew is the issue of the gospel. It's the issue of the gospel to the Greek. It's the issue of the church. And so I'm sharing my burden, as it has been triggered by listening to our dear brother Martin. And someone said they're happy that I'm seeing this because they were born to me in New York. Is God himself being taken away? Is he being seduced by the impressive scholarship and erudition and refinement of these precious Talmudic men, fifth generation, who were like clods next to these men in their remarkable knowledge, none of your people, but the other Semitic language. Aramaic. Aramaic. And so on, so they ask questions. We're stunned and stupefied. We can't answer. They seem to have all the answers.

The effrontery of insisting upon our faith in view of all that is either colossal egoism and arrogance or absolute humility.

One or the other. The rabbi can't understand, but by now I'm not thrown into power.

Hasn't he told me enough to show me how fraudulent this whole Greek myth is about Jesus and how it was a commonplace in the ancient world of a Godly son born mystically from the heavens and lives and dies and then is resurrected and Jesus is only a takeoff on that mythical pagan origin? How can you continue on to be a Jewish man and subscribe to that nonsense?

Haven't you seen the light yet? Why do you keep hanging on? I'm hanging on for your sake. Somehow at one point in our five, six hours together on a particular Wednesday, in some moment when I think I'm not at all succeeding and I'm ready to throw in the towel one last word or look or gesture, the word has come. Light for heaven. A key turn. And a man's ass falls on his face and cries out, my lord and my God. That's what we're waiting for. That's what we're praying for. That's my wisdom, my cleverness, my learning that I come even to begin to match notes with such men.

By trusting a word, a word will come to unlock his soul and bring light on all that he already knows but has not come to him as revelation.

But you know what it would cost him to surrender to that revelation?

His wife, his family, his place in the Jewish community, his forebears, fifth generation, there's nothing less than a death sentence for such a man to believe in Jesus because if he believes, he will equally proclaim being Jewish.

It will cost him everything but it will be the key to life to those who will hear him.

So, this is not an invitation to resume again the unhappy, if not tragic triumphalism and triumphalism and arrogant disdain of the early churches of the Jewish community.

The church was pricked and provoked by Jews who were saying that, that, that, that, that, that you claim that you found the Messiah you're a bunch of Gentile dumb-dumbs you don't even know a language and that's how you're interpreting it. You're all wrong and you've missed it and beside that, we're coming again. The scriptures speak of our restoration. God is going to honor us, we will be exalted above all nations.

Can you imagine men like Chrysostom and other of the early church leaders being pricked and chafed by that kind of Jewish person? But Luther himself and a later generation, the church has failed in its relationship with the Jew and has allowed itself to be provoked and irritated unto resentment rather than absorbing like a pincushion this necessary refutation and bearing it and loving them even and I know from my own experience speaking at university campuses from Harvard, Yale, University of California to wherever I've been in the world and I've spoken at universities, why do I speak at them?

Because that's where you're likely to find a Jewish audience if you can't get into the synagogues and very invariably when you come into a crowd of Jewish students, the anger because what do you represent?

You're opaque, flunky, you're some kind of missionary with a goyasha Bible under your arm trying to persuade them to forsake being Jewish and speaking that name by which we have been persecuted historically and boom, they let you have it and you're like a pincushion you just have to absorb all of their accusations all their indictment and you can't say, no, no, no, that's not me I'm not related to the crusaders, no, no I'm not with that institution they don't know the difference the name is all Christianity, you're coming in that name you're invited with them and before you can get the word because you have got to allow them to express their screen give off their invective all of that anger and then what it's spent, you might get in the word well the church has not been willing to do that so by all of the things that I'm reviewing, I'm not inviting the church to pick up again and be to the Jews a hostile arrogant entity but to know the truth of the situation and to bear that truth and come to them and relate to them in the love that knows and will not be a fact it does not require our arrogance it's a realistic affirmation of indisputable centrality of the cross does not imply a corresponding contempt but a pathos of identification with our Jewish kinsmen have been inured to the saving faith by a time-honored religious culture commendable and attractive in many ways with Christ projecting at its heart and hence without the saving faith that's a phenomenal statement not bad for 4 a.m a realistic affirmation of things I'm putting before you of the indisputable centrality of the cross as the only one faith the only one saving faith does not imply a corresponding contempt but a pathos if I had the chance to ask a question that Marvin mentioned Abraham Heschel I would have asked could you please enlarge on Heschel's concept of pathos and his two volumes on the prophets because the Lord himself quickened that word for us last summer that the church needed to come into a pathos of identification with the Jew and his sympathy pathos if you could have a pathos out of a knowledge of the truth of that one not out of a naivety or unknowing willingness to see the truth but knowing the truth knowing the rejection, knowing the hostility knowing the anti-Christ propensity of this community and its leadership and still have a pathos and still have an identification not just of a sentimental kind but of a kind for which you would lay down your life and I could say to my rabbi as he drove me to get in my car and my last visitor broke down and I had to leave it across the river in New Jersey and we were alone in the car together I said, has any man ever loved you as I have? who do you know who can match the affection that issues for me, for you from anyone out of your own Judaism though you have abused me called me names and acted with anger and insulted me who else do you know within your Jewish framework who has loved you as amply as I? you did not answer my question it's the love of God it's the pathos of God and so I'm saying the knowledge of the truth does not require us to be arrogant or hostile to death it's one thing to be innocent and not know and then be blithed in your conduct but to be knowing and to have pathos is a statement of utmost spirituality in fact, it's coming close to the very character of God himself remember what is waiting for what is being waited for that the deliverer might come out of Zion and take direction from Jacob when my servants shall have compassion on their stones and pity upon their dust when my church shall have pathos for the Jewish community and know how long they have suffered their rejection of me and how hostile they've come in their framework and how they oppose themselves in their own ignorance and the bleed in sympathy for that condition and pray for the lifting of that veil then the deliverer shall come out of Zion why then? because his purpose for the church is to fulfill he has a right for the bridegroom that's just like him because he's used the pathos of God himself now he can live with Israel but the whole object of Israel was inculcated and provided the incentive for the church to come into that condition true or not? okay that which is not of this faith is still sin that which is not of faith is sin I'm still learning it to say that which is not of this faith is sin the faith by which salvation is obtained because all of the so-called great faiths employ the word faith but what does it mean? a compendium of doctrinal statements of the distinctors of this land or Judaism or whatever it is but the faith that is the faith is sin and that which is not of that faith is still sin so what good deeds can be issued from those who have not come into that faith and see their own called faith as a viable alternative we are not called to denigrate your host but proclaim the truth in love this does not mean condescending sentimentality and avoidance of your principle of faith but of being cruel in order to be kind of being firm of being insistent my mother I don't want to hear another word of this not another word I said look the day will come in eternity when your cry and regret will be not that I have said too much but that I have not said enough is that a nice way for someone to talk to his mother? well what's nice when an aged lady's eternal destiny is at stake and one must be cruel to her in order to be kind to her but not sparing I'm such an enemy of sentiment I can't tell you I see sentiment as the most devious thing that has ever issued from the bowels of hell that is disguised as being somehow attractive and commendable and nice to receive and fear and to express but destructive of truth and keeping people from the kinds of issues that will affect their eternity thank you so those and by the way our kindness will be construed as cruelty you call that love, you call that being a Christian? that's the report that you'll get the guess that this being a Christian whether or not you understand it and if you don't understand it I don't wait for your understanding in order to speak that truth your understanding will come because I've spoken it the precipitated crisis of faith can only be justified in the light of eternity why stir an old lady up? why kidnap her from Palm Beach, West Palm Beach where she's lived for the last 30 years in her condominium with all of her adorable little ditchy goo on the walls and her honorary plaques from Hadassah hospital and all of the Jewish things she contributed and her husband who was a bed atheist was the vice president of the Jewish congregation and take her away out of that environment that is so sentimental so condescending to the flesh in December and bring her to Northern Minnesota because it was the only interlude when I had some free time on my schedule to affect that kidnapping if I had to wait until I came back from my next trip my mother would have been dead so we hastily constructed that little place where she came in the house and packed her bags, got her goods moved and sold and disposed and she was walking to the last we almost had to take her with her chair out of the house and buttering and complaining all the way and when she finally got here complaints if I had known that you were going to be making all these trips I would not have come what do you think I'd do when I'm home I'm a minister, I have a call I'm trying to explain that to an unsafe Jewish woman the only time she ever changed her tune and blessed my going was after she had called it and I never worked so the second day she said we were told, what about the others the way is narrow and now that I was going on a trip that would further this message and establish places of refuge for Jews in flight in the nations throughout she sent me this blessing what do you think happens 10 days after my departure she dies and then I'm in Scotland well what do I do, do I continue in the work here, do I go home do I go to West Palm Beach where her body has been brought back to be buried alongside her unbelieving ex, her deceased husband and John Parsons economic, wonderful package door to door from Aberdeen, Scotland to West Palm Beach and then to London I would just only have to miss about 7 or 8 days of ministry and so I'm putting it before the Lord with his parents and finally felt my Glenda herself is encouraging me to go home and that more than my physical presence at the tomb site she wanted me to continue with that work that would bring salvation deliverance to my children I said Lord if that's true let the very next meeting in Scotland bear unquestioning evidence that you have promoted something by my being present that would not have taken place otherwise that has to do with Jewish flight, rescue, salvation and in the next place up in the highlands of Scotland where at the base of the highlands where they cattle are brought down after the winter and then they're fed in that place and kept in a kind of ambient condition and then sent to market the Lord gave me the sense Jews will be coming down in those passes from those high places they'll be thin and stretched out and physically exhausted and they'll have a place here where they're speaking because of their speaking this Christian body will anticipate they're coming will have prepared for them, they will be fed, they will be rested and they'll not go to market from there they'll go to Zion Amen So to precipitate a crisis of faith can only be justified in the law of eternity. Why become raised excruciating issues for those who are already comfortable in their Judaism?

Can we allow them to die like that?

Only eternity justifies striking that crisis It's the issue of what lies beyond this life and anyone who knows anything about Jews knows that we have very little consideration for what lies beyond this life We are this world, this life oriented. A life to come is not part of a general understanding given from the Judaism In fact it's a subject that's not encouraged or not developed because what knowledge can they have for what lies beyond death and that's why so much attention and energy is given to what is exceeding in this life That's why we're so successful That's why we have to amass a fortune, win an old old prize, leave behind the name of legacy because there's no life beyond this life So one of us is terribly wrong We have that mini-evil notion as Christians that this life is only preparation It's a veil of tears It's a formative time for that which is to come which is eternal Paul saw in the things that are invisible and eternal, saw his present afflictions as both momentarily neither he's all screwed up or he's all right but he had a view of that which is invisible and eternal that affected his present profoundly which is totally absent from Jewish consideration So I'm saying this, if eternity is eternity the issue of eternal hell and anguish of soul without remedy, without belief we have a justification for promoting an anguish of soul presently in the crisis that comes from our word and our witness it will set in motion those things that redound eternal salvation But do we ourselves believe that? Have we retained a sense of that which is eternal?

Finney said when the church loses its sense of hell, people have lost its reality as church Wow The willingness of that loss in the land of that eternity is the very definition of loss What loss?

The loss of losing their friendship, their relationship that we cherish because we have said something in that ungainly way or raised a question that has exacerbated and wounded and caused upset The fact that we're willing to suffer that loss might be the greatest testimony of what we are about as so persuasively real Can you answer that? They know that we love them, they know that we cherish that relationship, but we're willing even to risk its loss and the offence that comes by raising the question of eternal life as a relationship or there is no other And when they see the willingness to risk the loss of that relationship with themselves they might think this guy is not just awful, he's not just speaking out of his doctrinal cap Evidently the issue of eternity for him is unmistakably real and that he's persuading me in a knowledge of something that I could not have except that he communicates it and is willing to do so at the risk of the loss of my love and my friendship There must be something to what he's saying or he will not take that risk That's being a witness unto the world To hear the voice of Rabbi Rosen in the video shows us that he has an unquestioned relationship to God, has no need of a mediator That ought to pierce us through, for only one The other can be true as I've said The word of Jesus that no man comes to the Father but my knee with a rabbi's subjective confidence in the face of it To be silent as Christians when such ghosts are made is to confirm or validate them with an exit and turn the word of Christ into a lie It gives to that Judaism a validity that Paul's claim in Romans 9 that he himself would wish himself to be christened as Revenson would never have allowed If a Rabbi Rosen can come to it a seeming salvation independent of Christ Why would he wish himself to be christened? We've got to reckon these things for us to allow the risks of the loss of the soul who makes it and the whole apostolic royalty and character of the church and its church To be silent when such statements are made is to put the church, its theology, its doctrines as grounding in the word of the word no question, hence more has been lost than the name of interfaith relations and can be understood when we confirm them in their suppositions by our silence Sometimes one must be cool in order to be kind and to be cool in this case is to say this Rabbi I'm sorry dear sir, I don't care what feels objectively, that is a patent no no, it cannot be true it makes my faith a lie One of us is in grievous in grievous error and so long as there's breath in me I'll contend for my error because I believe that your eternity is at stake by it To say that we have a warning call a phrase that our brother has used often is to apply unlimited amounts of time as if there were no eschatological intricacy of time running out, as if the lengthened shadows of global anti-Semitism and could not massage the devastating kind of Jacob trouble in which Jesus himself spoke in explicit warning Amen What long call? Judgment is at the door things are ready to collapse Israel's existence is in greatest peril and Jews worldwide now, you're not going to be a Zionist anymore to be an object of attack you have already been Jewish What long call?

Is this the best of all worlds where we have the luxury of continuing an unbroken relationship over the course of time, maybe something might be worked?

Well if you come into a mentality like that, I want you to know it is non-apostolic, for the distinctive of apostolic church is the expectancy of some imminent, soon to be fulfilled eschatological reality we're moving to a climax a last days upheaval a clash of kingdoms, the powers of darkness, anti-Christ, fearful things blood and fury and fire poured out on the earth Jerusalem itself will be cleansed by the spirit of burning Yes So what long call? It may well be, that's longer than we think but I think we ought to act and believe on the assumption that it's short the time is short and these things shall short the time to pass and we have not the luxury to cultivate hurtful long relationships we need to find the first and early opportunity to speak the word It's jarring, however, crisis bringing that will set in motion those considerations that will make for self-reflection for not to have an attitude of eschatological expectancy is no longer to be the church and that's why I'm saying that if we come into this framework of understanding that is called interfaith relationship we are threatening and forfeiting the very character of church as church, and not only do we then do the service to the Jew but also to the Greek So, the whole of man's eternity might hang upon a present moment when time might not again come as was demonstrated in the unsparing conversation of the Lord himself in Nicodemus It was only a one-time conversation not a long call and something had to be spoken however jarring that would set in motion those things that make for salvation, while Judaism's definition of the word salvation might differ from our own the one definition that counts is that given by God and the death and resurrection of his son as the one eternity for all eternity You don't believe in salvation you think it means social justice and other conditions that need to be defended? That's nice but I want to give you the definitive understanding of what salvation is as God himself sees it defines it, and by which we ourselves will be held accountable It's that definition that you need to know It's not that we respect yours, you need to come into the understanding of God himself for his salvation is the issue of death, resurrection and the illness of life Utterly supernatural and hinging upon the acknowledgement of him whom he has sent and what was performed in him and the calling upon them You may have another concept of salvation but it doesn't save This is the one that you need to know and to act upon So this is not a matter of opinion, but conviction which we are under obligation to share as non-negotiable though it brings its necessary offense. An opinion can be tolerated, even humored maybe even respected but a conviction requires a yes or no for or against God Are we presenting something as an opinion that they can shock off and say, well it's nice for you to believe that or are we saying, no, this is a conviction, this is out of God's very heart, this is established in his word If you'll not believe it, you'll perish It's not something that you can idly dangle and play with as an opinion It's a conviction, you have either to reject it or to receive it For or against God For or against God That's the issue And it's the issue of eternity This is not a matter of opinion They are a target That they are a target is not the issue of some kind of delight of putting a match in our belts We're targeting Jews Hey, that's not nice They don't want to be singled out for this kind of attention It's not that we get some kind of light and we want to put a match in our belt It's not that we're just doing it for our lead ones and Lord But the testimony of the very God for people who remain the apple of his eye They are his target They are the apple of his eye They are the object of his consideration Particularly as we come to the end of the age and that he's full of compassion mercy and will not allow them to perish He's not slack concerning his policies but he's not willing that any should perish People especially They are the apple of his eye The target of his affection and attention It is the Jew who is not who is afar off and needs to be made nigh by the blood of Jesus that he might be created the new Messiah Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should look at again You read Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8-13 not as it was originally intended The Gentiles who were far off without God, without hope in the world were now brought nigh but read it as God's presence taken to the Jew who we've come full circle It's the Jew now who is without God without hope in the world and who is far off and needs to be brought by the blood of his own Messiah into the commonwealth of his own people, their hopes and comments and promises that he might be created anew That's what salvation is The work of Messiah Jesus unto good works not your works, not your religious works not works that issue out of conscience or thinking that you can bargain with God and negotiate someone's work for so much recognition but the good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them for no other work is worth walking that was established before the foundations of the earth were made. No other work is considered by God as good nor acceptable in his sight but that which issues from the faith which is the gift of God and not of ourself lest any man boast This is the conversion which is an issue It turned a murderer and persecutor into a chief apostle a Jacob into an Israel and must be effected on this side of the grave and is ultimately the issue of Jewish identification itself To comfort Jews with platitudes that we are all God's children is to do them an eternal service to as many as received him gave him the power to become the sons of God and not have killed them He who hath the son hath life and he who hath not the son hath not life and the wrath of God abides upon him Jesus did not mince the terrifying words in John 8, 21 and 24 if you will not believe, notes the emphasis if you will not believe kind of implies you have every right and obligation to believe therefore what I have said, what I have spoken what I have done, why do you not believe? If you still persist in willing not to believe you need to know that you are dying of your sins and what is the capstone and the summation of all your sin is that unwillingness to believe How shall we in superficial preference to then say less? Read again John 3, 15 and 16 God so willed the world that he gave his only begotten son the host who will believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life the day of our Lord is at hand rands need to be plucked from the fire an apostolic absoluteness an an absoluteness of eye, surrogate, authority and power needs to be restored to the church the issue of the Jews, the issue of the church the issue of the Greek, the coming of the Lord is theocratic rule and kingdom we need to be governed by its felt sense, timidness, its nearness and not be lulled into a non-apostolic casualness that expects and indeed desires and won't call this kind of urgency is totally compatible with apostolic faith and need not express itself as frenzy, as if the suggestion that if you have this sense of urgency you're going to be foaming at the mouth you'll be irrational, you'll come on like gangbusters no, you can have a sense of urgency and be sober without frenzy and that that's so blinding and the high seriousness of the eschatological faith is that to which we are called, reward by faith not fear, especially the fear of falling into extremes, worst extremes by being virtuous, speak the truth of love let's speak it avoid reference to the word to come the world to come is to avoid the faith and to confirm the unsuspecting into the greatest of all deceptions that there's more life beyond this life and that this life is whole the shriek and hollowness that comes in the moment of eternity is incalculable the vassal of the ashram said that in that moment when the day of eternity, the moment of eternity comes all values as we have understood them will be totally reversed that which we celebrate in the world will be abhorred by God there'll be a complete reversal all to which we are subscribed with our life, our energy and time and it's too late to remedy anything it's an internal shriek without relief, we need our souls and our spirit and how that has always a backdrop in our relationship with these people eternity is at stake so it avoids the faith and confirms the unsuspecting into the greatest of all deceptions it is to diffuse the gospel, it is to weaken it, the distinctive of the church itself as church and becomes a victory for the powers of darkness in the very name of interfaith initiative, as it is written by Layan Zion, a stumbling stone and rock of offense whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed so Lord, thank you blood out, anything that I've spoken, read, commented that is in disagreement with yourself allow to remain that which is in perfect agreement, that was calculated for our consideration let it find a place of deposit and be brought again and again to our consciousness and especially to stir us if we're faced with a challenging issue with a Jew where we would be tempted humanly to back up, to retreat, to compromise to go easy, to go soft, to make nice, remind us again of the issues of eternal life, that one must be cruel sometimes in order to be kind and not to decode the word of truth lest this word, so much as it is your own let it be factored in as much as your brother wants to respond to and we just thank and give you praise for this interfaith dialogue between ourselves, which we can afford as lecturing, but not with them not on the basis of the doctrine acknowledgement that there's some inherent validity which they already possess independent of Christ in Jesus name we pray, Amen Thanks for watching!
