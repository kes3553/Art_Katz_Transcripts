Sonship with the Father 2 of 2 - Art Katz

How are we doing?

Is it too much at one time, too much content?

Can you take it? Are you able from morning by morning?

Or do we have to alter maybe every other day or half a morning?

How are you guys doing? I don't, I don't, I don't want to work. Every day all day. You're okay? Okay. Pray for enlargement.

Enlargement of capacity, because this is so remarkably rich material and virginal.

I don't know where else it's being sounded. As our sister said, this is foundation of foundations.

If we have not this foundation, we're batting at the air. So now I want to take up the question that, to which this theologian leads us. And by the way, when we hear these theologians, we should be earning a respect for this noble labor. A theologian is not one to be disrespected himself. Men who labor in the world work and give themselves studiously an attention to the original languages and have a breadth of knowledge of what other scholars have said about a particular subject and have learned to sharpen their faculties and to even sum up the perspectives of others with which they're not in agreement and will set forth that perspective faithfully and then take it apart and critique it and show why they cannot be in agreement and then go on to state their own. I can't think of any more valuable instrument for our own sharpening than to delve into and read the work of such men.

So that's why I feel free to quote them.

But even to hear these quotes and to catch the sense of them requires an unusual alertness on your part. Reading words is always deadly and these men are so complex in their word and thought that it's not everyday speech. And our Christian experience has not prepared us for men who are so succinct and say so much in few words.

So appreciate that and grow into that.

So this call bought has been examining the privilege of calling upon God as Father and what its remarkable significance it is seeing that the Father is the hub and the pivot of very reality itself and that this is not a right that we take to ourselves in human presumption to call upon him as we will. It's something granted to us as a grace by Jesus himself who commands us to call upon God the Father and gives us the enablement so to do. And then as we go on what is the benefit of that call?

It's everything for us as the church.

Now he's going to take up the question what is the issue of having been given that privilege we do not avail ourselves of it? What's the consequence of falling asleep at the controls and though we have the privilege of calling upon God the Father we fail to do so or do it half-heartedly. So here again the theologian is raising questions that are needful that I want to go into at this time. So what God the Father wills with us and for us to his own glory and our salvation is more than a solid but stationary relation or a firm but passive connection.

He's the living father of his living children. Not a beautiful statement? Talk about father and children.

He's the living father of his living children and we will only be living children to the degree that the Father is for us living and not just a fixed category or an honorary title to which we are religiously called to speak.

There's a living in this for him and for us.

What he wills with and for these children is therefore intercourse living dealings between himself and them, between them and himself. They too have to end into these dealings on their side. The veil is rent from his side but what about from our side? They have to actualize the partnership in this history. They have to express in word and deed his fatherhood and their sonship. What's the point of it something being potentially available to us if we do not employ it? If we do not call, if we don't call upon God the Father, if though it's a privilege afforded us and one in which we're encouraged to employ, what is the consequence when we don't?

It's serious.

The neglect of so great a privilege has got to have consequence and that consequence is visible and evident in the church today for the failure to call and it's a good thing to explore why. Maybe the root of it is pride, unbelief, self-satisfaction with ourselves out of our own humanity that we have no need to call.

We don't see ourselves as desperate.

We don't see our condition as urgent and maybe that's a statement that the faith has been so reduced from its radical apostolic content that we ourselves can perform it without calling upon God the Father. Isn't that a final, what's the word, anomaly, contradiction and maybe the very threshold of apostasy itself? When God is no longer called upon, no longer needed, we are at the door of apostasy where we can continue to invoke the language but without the reality because the apostate church of the last days is not one that visibly knocks its fist in God's faith. It continues to conduct services, have worship teams and say the right things but without the reality and the pity is they don't even know it or see it. So we need to God the privilege of calling upon God the Father as Father. So much is at stake with that call and we have been granted it and encouraged to it through Jesus who also gives us the enablement to make that call in a significant way of Father as more than just a title but as an endearing image of something called up in that call of a real person, a real God, a reality. Not only a reality, the reality because if we lose that, we lose reality and to lose reality, what is more pathetic in Christianity than to lose the reality of God and have only the husk and the form of its language and not its palpable resonating reality. So they have to express in word and deed His Fatherhood in their sonship.

Sonship means exerting it. Sonship means expressing it. You're not a son if you're slack.

You diminish in sonship if you shut your mouth, if you do not call, if you feel no obligation to pray, if you do not express respect, if you do not honor. Sonship is not just an abstract title, it's an activity, it's a conduct, it's a status that needs to be expressed, exerted, and maintained actively. To be an inactive son is a contradiction in terms and in fact in our own human relationships when a son is inactive toward his father, he's lost his distinction.

He's no longer a son.

He may be technically but in actuality he's a dead piece of timber. He's not maintained and revered the relationship and given himself to it in an active way, in a respectful way, in an honoring way, and he himself pays the price of that loss. So to be obedient to this command, to call upon Him as Father is to rise up as the prodigal son did to take away to the father as his child, to speak intimately to him, to claim a hearing from him, invocation and aims at renewal, or rather the dynamic actualization of what has become a static stagnant and frozen relationship with him. So the title of this chapter is invocation, to invoke, to activate a privileged relationship with the father because if we don't keep it actively we fall into a static stagnant and frozen relationship. We've lost the key to the dynamic actualization of a certain relationship with the father.

Got the picture? And it's so easy to do.

And in fact we have done it. And in fact this is an apt description of us today. Stagnant, frozen, static, non-active, alive and dynamic. On his side of course the relationship never ceased to be dynamically actual.

It never stopped working and speaking as the father of his children.

On the side of his children however there was and always will be the dangerous possibility, or even worse, the evil reality of halting, resting, and rusting.

Praise God for Kolbar. He didn't get this out of a book.

He got this out of being a pastor with a German-Swiss congregation which is the toughest kind, the most critical analytical to penetrate. And so he's bringing the anguish of his own soul and the observing of this Germanic critical mentality that does not cultivate the relationship with father because it requires humility.

It requires humbling. It requires love. It requires something active.

And these Germanic types sit on their humps and refuse to open their mouths.

Refuse to call. Refuse to pray. Refuse to honor. Refuse to acknowledge.

And they become stagnant, frozen, inert, and dead.

So we need to be warned. He's telling us this can become an evil condition.

What begins with neglect and indifference, if you keep up like that, it becomes an evil thing, a reality, halting, resting, and rusting until you're unable to call. That there's nothing more agonizing to your soul than to humble yourself and call upon God the Father.

You cannot. You've gone, you've passed the point of no return.

Your so stultified, so fixed in your obdurate condition, you can no longer pray. So how can you be about your father's business? You can only be about your own. So this is foundational, dear, dear saints. If we're going to be sons, sons must be active in prayer and worship, in submission and honoring, and calling upon the name, which is our great privilege. And if we harden in that, cannot pray, devotion to us is a dead end. We can't imagine ourselves getting up earlier and finding a quiet place before the Lord and talking to them.

It's like lead. Our words fall to the ground. We end before we begin. We give up. Anybody in that condition?

Aren't one of the things that helped me the most, I think it was tozer, I'm not quite sure about, I think it was. And a couple of years ago I was reading, and I knew the need for developing my relationship with the Lord deeper and all that, but coming out of a religious background that's very firmly, it was, may still be to some extent firmly entrenched in me, I had to learn a new living way on everything, I think, that he made a statement that set me free, and it was so simple, because I'm a simple person, it helped me, and he said, God is a person, Jesus is a person, Holy Spirit is a person, therefore you can develop a relationship with him as you would with any person.

Well, how is that?

You spend time with them, you talk to them, you share the things, your interests with one another, and that hit home with me in its simplicity.

That did it for me. You need to read the biography of Spurgeon. He prayed incessantly.

People who took walks with him in the woods, they said he was continually praying, or he would stop and say, look at this, let's bow here and give God praise for the beauty of his creation. The man was continually prayerful, continually in conversation with the Lord, and when he got up on a Sunday morning to speak before 6,000 people in the metropolitan tabernacle without a microphone, he boomed the resonance of God with a voice that was so pliable that it could make people move from laughter to tears from one moment to the other. His voice was such an instrument for the conveyance of God, because all through the week it was being fed, it was being enamored, it was taking up dimensions of God through his frequent acknowledgments in prayer continually. Now, think of the love of God the Father that gives to the Son all of his substance and allows him to go out and misspend it wastefully and find himself in the corral with the pigs and eating their husks, and finally so reduced that he says, I'm not worthy to be a son to this Father, but I have to go back and return. And the Father is not only waiting, he runs to meet him with a kiss, a ring, and a garment and makes a feast that the Son who is dead is now alive. I'm saying all that to say this, if you'll allow your relationship to God to die, if you find it difficult to pray, if you cannot summon an inward reality that corresponds to the word God and Father, the Lord will allow you to eat husks. He'll allow you to misspend everything, and you'll find yourself degraded and finally so desperate that what you had not volunteered when you were able, you will now volunteer out of your desperation.

Got that?

If you'll not pray when you're able, you'll pray when you're desperately needful, and that is yet a God the Father who waits to hear that prayer. And so my encouragement as a Father in the faith is this, don't wait for that desperation.

Don't misspend your precious substance.

Don't allow yourself to be degraded and come to a final place where you're eating like pigs and then have to cry if the Father will receive you, though you're not worthy to be a son.

Now activate yourself. Now seek the Lord. Now pray.

Now enjoy this relationship because in the West Minister confession, it gives the principle, what is the purpose of salvation? The chief purpose of man is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. To glorify God and to enjoy him forever. And if you're not enjoying God, how are you doing with God's people? How should you find more delight with God's people and all of their defect and condition if you'll not find delight in God? They will be as dead to you as God himself, and your relationship will only be minimal and mechanical so that we will fall into the conditions of our communities where men are described as the pig man, the chicken man, the machine shop man. The man is his identity by what he does, but he has no value for what he is.

You got me what I'm saying? You have no love, no delight.

I have a particular delight in some of the Hutterite men that have come to us.

I love to hear them. I love to see them. I love to hear their prayer. I'm wearing $4,000 new hearing aids. Not that the old ones were that bad, but I was missing what one of the brothers was saying in particular. I didn't want to miss a word that he says. It's precious to me. I want to hear him.

You have no delight in God's sons if you have no delight in their father. And then what then is the body of Christ?

Some kind of mechanical assemblage that functions according to certain principles?

The whole genius of the church is destroyed when we have no delight in God's sons because we have no delight in their father and our father.

Sons is an activity.

Speaking of the prodigal son, what about the other son, the servant?

He's seen as a servant. It's all religious service. The other brother.

Are we going to be able to get to the point too where instead of being that, are we going to be able to welcome back the brother that was with the pigs? Was that unconditional love for them? Or are we going to see ourselves as that area of pride where, look what I've done for God.

Now this guy thinks he can come back and reclaim the gift. It's going to take a long time. He will not be able to enter his feast. He will be outside the door pouting. You never did this for me when I was faithful. Okay.

Invoking God the Father is the enterprise that follows his word and summons to come back out of an atmosphere of unnatural cold and aloofness to one of natural warmth and intimacy.

Did you get that? Okay.

Invoking God the Father, what's the whole purpose?

What's the point of it?

It is the enterprise that follows his word and summons. This is his invitation to come back out of an atmosphere of unnatural cold and aloofness to one of natural warmth and intimacy. It is the attempt in relation to him who acts and meets him actively, not just to keep on waiting slackly for whatever develops. That's the mentality and the attitude of children who have not yet become sons.

They are slack in their attitude.

Well, if it comes when he wants, I'm not sure.

They're not pressing. They're cold and indifferent and aloof.

God summons and invites us to call upon him as the Father. Calling upon him as Father is God's provision to keep us from falling slack and becoming cool, indifferent, and dead.

That's what this theologian is telling us. This is not a formality. This is not a mechanical provision.

This is through God's grace to keep us from falling into a condition to which we will invariably come if we do not as sons press into the Father and call upon him. Not just for petitions, not only for our need, but for his own sake as a person. It's the most difficult thing we would rather do. We'd rather perform some act, but for the relationship to come to a natural, feeling, warm, affectionate regard with God as Father is more difficult for us than fighting demons and making heroic deeds for the kingdom.

It's the most difficult, the least rewarding, and the most discouraging.

The world of flesh and the devil will get you to quit before you begin because there's no visible evidence of anything being obtained, particularly if you're sensual or sensate or measure success in terms of some felt experience.

If that experience does not come, you're ready to quit.

You need to read, I think the article is now on our website, on the presence of God, esteeming the presence of God.

There's no sonship without disguise.

We can pack up and quit, go home, and forget the great word, the honor, the glory, sons of the Father, sons being called to glory. If we will not enjoy God if we will not have a sense of what he is, it is Godliness as Father and have an intuitive sense of that without seeing him or necessarily feeling. And it saves us from becoming cold, hard, indifferent, and alienated, not only from him but from each other.

It requires an assertion. A son is an active entity.

He prays, he calls, he worships. I pray that it's given by the Lord. It's the sons of God, our souls and hearts, and that his son be formed in us.

It's a descent in scripture.

We enter into it, we enter into it, we enter into it, and that his son be formed in us.

It's a descent in scripture.

Creation is morning and brooding for the sons of God to come to glory. And only prayer is going to bring this into existence. Lord is calling for men to become intercessors.

He's calling, he's pleading.

The Spirit of God is weeping for men to become intercessors. That the Father himself can bring forth what he desires to bring forth in the earth for his sons.

They're not saying the daughters are not important because they are.

They have a place to help the sons to come forth into intercession. The question needs to be raised. How many of us have an active intention to become sons?

That we desire sonship.

That we see this as honorific, as an ultimate statement of the faith to which we have been called and the salvation which we have been given. That we're not just content to be slack with one day like another. We desire to come into the fullness of the privilege by which God has glorified mainly as sons. If we have not the conscious intention, we will not obtain it. So I just want to raise the question. How many consciously, willfully, choose to be sons?

It's not automatic.

It's a growth into something by an assertion and not just an attitude that waits for whatever develops.

Not just to keep on being silent.

In this way they attempt to overcome and leave behind the strange, perverse, and totally unfu-fu distance from him. The movement from the children to the father is the thing that is commanded.

You've got to move into or else this distance is strange and perverse. It's unnatural.

God never intended for a presence in the earth of Christians who have not a son's relationship with the father.

That's strange. That's unnatural. That's perverse.

What he intended was the same kind of relationship that Jesus had of a warm, palpitating, trusting regard and a calling in a frequency to be the norm for those that are in the earth as Christians. Anything less and other than that is perverse, slack, unfruitful, degenerate, an evil reality of holding, resting, and resting.

Who has ever reproved us like that?

Who has ever spoken to us as firmly as that and shown us what would be the consequence if we neglect God as father?

No one. No one has ever addressed us like that.

They've allowed us to get by with the terminology of sons and sonship in a shallow way because they themselves are shallow. How shall they reprimand us? But the love of God the Father is this.

He'll not let us get away.

The love of God the Father is showing us what the neglect of his own fatherhood will mean if we choose to remain silent and slack. This is love to provoke us to call upon him and to exercise the very privilege which is ours as children to call upon God as father.

Okay.

I've often come away from preaches and teachings on sonship with the impression that it was an automatic station that was given.

Yeah, not at all. It's an adoption.

Even Jesus, who Reggie and I were talking at the break, had to learn obedience through suffering and of an author whom I intend to bring before your attention.

P.T. Forsyte's another great English writer. He said Jesus became what he always was.

He was always the son, but he became the son by his own human attention to the very thing that God is speaking to us. His own devotional relationship with the Father and his obedience to the things that the Father, which the Father called him, brought him into the sonship, which was already his, which he always has, but he had now to appropriate humanly and actively as a son in the earth.

Why?

That we would have a model for our own emulation and faith, that it was not automatic for him, though he was the Son of God by creation. From the beginning, before he made his advent into the earth, but he didn't come in just saying, look my no hands, I'm accustomed, this is what I always was, I'll just continue what I did in my pre-incarnate life.

Nothing like that.

He had to walk in and fulfill and appropriate and come to maturity in an active way so that when they found him in the temple and said, why, how you like this?

It causes heartache and we thought you were lost.

Don't you know I had to be about my father's business?

They didn't know.

And it says then, he went down with them to Nazareth and remained and dwelled in Nazareth until he came of age. He went back down with parents who did not know him, know his calling, did not understand him, and he went down with them in that condition to submit to them and honor his father and his mother and in the lowest place on the earth that later on in generations later they said, can any good thing come out of Nazareth? He went down to that and the next verse says, and he grew in grace and favor both with God and men.

He grew as a son by going down. He grew as a son by obedience.

He grew in the things that pertain to his son by the things that were contrary to his flesh by parents who did not understand his calling and yet submitting. So he became what he always was so that we would not say, well, don't expect me to be a son like that. It didn't have his advantage in deity, but he lay aside that deity and had to obtain through attention and worship and prayer and devotion the same way that we obtained that reality as a son. We have no advantage over us by virtue of being God.

Sonship is an accomplishment. Sonship is a glory. Sonship is an ultimate attainment.

Potentially, ours were given every grace and not the least of the graces to call upon God as Father, as trusting sons and to be in a respectful, worshipful, and affectionate regard with Father is the very key to sonship or else we grow cold and distant, separated, and stale and lose any affection in regard for the Father and for other of his children.

That's why I say how many people are willing for this. Sonship is an ultimate attainment and are called by the grace of God.

The first motive of their movement to him, which determines all that follows, is that they owe him the boundless acknowledgement of his free gift and knowing both him and themselves, they have at least the will and desire to discharge something of the debt of thanks. A son is grateful and those whom God condemns are sinful and judges them and gives them over to their own lusts. In Romans chapter one are those who have forsaken the creator for the creation and are not grateful.

Gratitude is an essential component of sonship.

It's a deeply felt experience because who are we to call on the Lord? Who are we to call on God the Father?

It's a privilege and a grace that requires our gratitude.

We should obtain gratitude because that calling and that gratitude is at the foundation and rudiments of not only what it means to be a son but what it means to be a man or what it means to be human, what it means to be distinguished as an aspect of God's creation. If you're devoid of gratitude, if you're devoid of this reality, what are you as a person let alone as a son? You're just a biological entity that consumes, that takes up space, that needs to be fed, that needs to be gratified sexually, that needs needs needs needs needs. But other than your needs and your consumption, what are you in significance as an entity if you have not gratitude and reverence for the God for whom such appreciation is due? That's why mankind is in its present condition, ungrateful, unholy, unthankful, disrespectful, and disobedient to parents. Everything that God says will mark the generation of the last days we are seeing come out large before us, unthankful, unholy, ungrateful, disobedient to parents, incapable of natural affection, incapable of mercy, hard, capable of murder, torture, devilish, why they have forsaken the grace that God offers to man in his image for which gratitude is a will spring.

Are you grateful or are you begrudging? So God, you be careful, don't dry up, don't become cold, don't become stultified, don't become fixed.

Bart's great almost exaggeration about the, not exaggeration, but great, well his focus on the extremity of this evil, how enormous this perversion really is, can only be measured with, like the scripture says, how should we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Only the greatness of the provision, the abounding availability of it, makes the indictment so much the greater. Had it been less, the indictment would not have been so great. So by what repentance have you come into the kingdom? By what repentance have you been saved from the unGodly, unthankful, and unholy humanity? Did you just make a decision at your will and choice? I think I'll call on the Lord the free offer of invitations, our unarmed saved. We're marked by a shallowness of a pervasive kind because we've not entered into the kingdom with the depth of brokenness and the recognition of our hard, cold, and thankless condition out of which we have been saved by the grace of God to become sons who are warm, palpitating, affectionate, honoring, regardless, grateful, gracious.

Got the idea?

Maybe, well we're going to come into this.

What is sin?

And for what have we been saved? And if we were saved out of that, would we not be more grateful now and relish and cherish not only that salvation but the opportunity through it to become sons by active persuasion and active seeking of the God who has saved us, the Father who sent his Son for that purpose? We're an ungrateful church, cold, and we're forced to conclude that only in this turn to unselfish praise from God which comes out of gratitude does invocation of the Father become what it is, the work of a people who are free because they are freed by God for God. This praise and gratitude and calling upon the Father is the free exercise of our will and if we do not make it, we diminish in that essential component by which we are distinguished not only as sons but as humans, as men.

We then become what? Beast children.

We become capable of most inhumane acts. We're worse than animals if we do not exercise a freedom by which we can have relationship with the Father and the graces that are elementary to our humanity.

Got the picture?

How should we encourage the unbelieving world to this relationship where we ourselves do not exercise it as sons? Part of the reason for ourselves is our witness to the unbelieving world of what is the benefit of his fatherhood by those who are privileged to call upon him and because we have been privileged, they are privileged because he's a God who is without, what's the word, without partiality because we're saved, they can be saved because we're grateful, they can be grateful because we have been made human freely and it shows in affection and warmth and respect they can be saved out of an unGodly generation that is condemned for judgment. Where's that witness if we ourselves have become cold and stale and indifferent and are not invoking the privilege of calling upon the Father freely because we are freed by God for God.

So there's something elementary about humanity itself.

So when I came to Africa and my message to the church was you need to be in guardianship for what is made in God's image in your black brethren who are being treated like animals, who are being neglected and being devoid of the most elementary consideration by those who are in power. You need to assert yourself as the church that has a regard for what is made in man's image and content for it and face those who are in the place of political power and say you guys need to meet the condition of mankind in an elementary way appropriate to their dignity as men because their life is not human in poverty, ignorance and disease.

Got the picture?

You can't be this kind of a church if you have not this regard for what is made in God's image and yourself if you have allowed your freedom to become impoverished and unused and have not asserted your benefit of the benevolence of God and the privilege to call and show forth the reality that comes from that. Who then can you charge about the neglect of humanity? If you yourself did not show that humanness that comes from the grace of God to those who call upon him as father.

There's a benevolence. I have a word for this.

You just showed the theological distinction between being human or being a beast. Being human or being a beast.

Humanity is defined in terms of this divine freedom.

To be deficient of it is to be bestial and that's an eschatological thing. We've seen that in our generation by the most cultured nation in the world whose culture failed them because they had not an elementary relationship with the father that would have sustained them.

They were devoid.

They had only a religious vocabulary of Protestantism or a false piety which collapsed under the weight of demonic oppression and they acted as beasts worse than animals in their treatment of Jews which is always the test of the church and we're going to see that that crisis come again. So this then is a sketch of the invocation of God for and to which his children are liberated invited and summoned which must come as event in the lives of Christians as thanksgiving, praise, prayer and therefore as the primal and basic form of the whole Christian ethos.

This is the name of the game.

This is the foundation of church.

This is the reality of realities.

This is the ultimate ground zero foundation and if you miss it here there's no picking it up in any other place.

You're a play actor. You're a performer. You're a dilettante.

You just pick up those things that touch your fancy and your interest but you're lacking the foundational relationship both with the father and his children.

That is the primal ethos of the faith. This is the foundation of foundations.

To go on to any other thing that's why we're beginning here would be pointless. Sin, judgment, the wrath of God, the mercy of God, salvation, redemption, sanctification, glorification, all those things would just be dead vocabulary, a terminology if we miss it here and we're missing it here. When certain people may not only be called the children of God but are this and as such qualified and fatally able, willing to call upon God their father when in this calling in their thanks and praise and prayer the Christian ethos is actualized, maintained, continued, and developed.

Well I wish I could brand that on every one of us. It's continued and developed. This is not a dead ethos.

This is a live organic thing that needs to be promoted and developed actively lest it become apostate. Praise, prayer comes out of gratitude, thanks through this calling and the Christian ethos, not A-T-H-O-S, is actualized, comes into reality and maintained and continued and developed.

There's no such thing as a slack son. It's a contradiction in terms. It's a, what do they call that word, an oxymoron. A slack son is if so facto not a son.

A son by definition, by nature, by calling is one active in gratitude, praise, worship, out of which comes his service. And maybe one of the most painful pseudo realities of our Christianity is the so-called worship by those who can strum guitars and turn up the amplifiers but have not a thankful heart, are not grateful, and that their praise that does not issue out of their gratitude because they have not recognized what is their summons and their call and the benevolence of God who gives them the right and invites them to call upon him as father. And that musicology that goes out, instead of livening and quickening the congregation and communicating to the sense of God who is being celebrated, deadens it. I was thinking about this the other day we were singing that song, it is well to my soul, and if a person does not have a sense of the person's heart when he wrote that song, you can repeat it without seeing the depth and the meaning of where they were coming from. And many songs we hear are very deep and have a real meaning, but when we try to recreate without the understanding of who the person is, where they were coming from, we just, we just, there's a counterfeit again, and we think we're praising and worshiping God but our hearts aren't. No praise without gratitude, no gratitude without acknowledgement, no acknowledgement without the realities to which we're called and for which the grace of God has been given, of which the principal one is calling upon God as father. If we miss it here, we miss it everywhere. It must become an event in the lives of Christians as thanksgiving praise and prayer, therefore the primal basic form of the whole Christian of us. Something that we do, it's a movement to call upon him and we continue to do, for which the Holy Spirit is given as an aid, as a blessing. My spirit rejoices in God, my Savior is the Magnificat of Mary. This is the mystery of the implication of God the Father by men and children. This then is the mystery of the central and basic act of Christian obedience which controls and determines everything, the mystery of the Christian life. My spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. My spirit rejoices in God, my Savior. My spirit rejoices in God, my Father. But religiosity does not need to call upon a fatherly God. It does not need any special movement and act of God. It does not need any baptism sending, outpouring, and gift of the Spirit. It may work itself out in this way and take this form but the spiritual life lives in invocation of God the Father and would be null and void without the and would be null and void without the special movement and act of this God without the work of the Holy Spirit. Religiosity does not need it, does not need the Spirit, does not need the grace of God because it does not seek, it does not honor, it's not grateful, it does not worship. The Spirit of God is given to them that obey him and the fundamental primal obedience is to call upon God as Father. This do, in this way pray, our Father which art in heaven, whatsoever you ask of the Father in my name it will be given to you.

We're commended, we're invited.

Not to do it is a disobedience and the Holy Spirit is given to them who obey. So how then can we seek God and how can we be grateful without the enablement of the grace of the Spirit? It's all together part of what is worshipful goes all together with summoning God. Everything is tied up with this active and continuing act of sons with the Father that call. Apart from the Holy Spirit no one can or will call Jesus Christ the Lord and we can say to that no one will call upon God as Father. Therefore no one can or will call upon God as Father and therefore in truth the Christians can and will do this because they may.

It is their spiritual life.

This life is one always related to the Father and the Son. The Father lets himself be moved by the giving of thanks because as he hears it their weak and dissonant voices are sustained by the one strong voice of the one by whose Eucharist the inadequacy of theirs is covered and glorified in advance. Hear the theologian saying however feeble you think your prayer is and your devotion God hears it and receives it in and with the Son because his Eucharist his thankfulness is taken up with yours so that you're being heard by God the Father with dimensions more than you are offering out of your own weakness and ineptitude. But if you don't offer in your weakness and ineptitude there's no further grace given with the voice of the Son. This is a remarkable insight and statement because we will be discouraged when we hear our own low quality of prayer and be encouraged to stop and he's saying however feeble it sounds to you the Father brings to it another dimension through the Son whose high priest. Your weak and dissonant voice is sustained by one strong voice of the one who's thankfulness the inadequacy of theirs is covered and glorified in advance. I've never heard this before I've never considered this before but I'm willing to consider it. It sounds like very grace that God does not evaluate the quality of our prayer as it sounds in our ears but he imbues it with something greater than our prayer which is the prayer of the Son who is ultimate intercessor but if you don't offer your minimal prayer neither will it receive that adornment.

Got the picture?

The devil wants to dismay you from offering up your minimal prayer and the theologians say when you do God will add dimensions not from yourself but from the greater self and that will work with the Father to invoke an answer beyond what you thought even to ask and to pray.

How do you like them apples?

Perhaps the quality of our prayer will be in relationship to how we have ceased from this kind of human evaluation so that we're actually weaned and this is the character of a son to be weaned and literally dead to these kinds of human evaluations which allows us to be self-focused and self-conscious but our prayers will take wings when we're trusting in his converting power and grace.

Take our feeble offerings and translate them.

I wish I had a buck for every time God has answered my prayers that I thought were embarrassing and inadequate and answered them as extravagantly and as lavishly as the most eloquent prayer that I had ever issued for me. That the Father's response to me is not proportionate to my own evaluation of my prayer. He answers my feeble prayers as profoundly as he as he answers what I think are my most eloquent prayers because that's what he is as a father you dear saints.

That's what he is as a loving father. He'll take your little scraps.

He'll take your inadequate little beep of a prayer and make it account as something deserving of his hearing and give an answer by it beyond anything that you thought it ought to summon. As I said to our brother this morning don't you define and establish the criteria for what you think is true repentance. Yes it might come and ought to come with tears and prostration in the most desirable form but what if it comes quietly and obscurely and it says pleasing to God as the demonstrative and emotional outbreak. We mustn't be connoisseurs or gourmets or define either for the issue of repentance or for the issue of prayer. The devil wants to dissuade you from being active sons who will offer up to father what meager things you're able for it will become enhanced by that measure from the son who is high priest and whose prayers are always heard and received by the father and yours will be born up with it is what the theologians say.

I believe it's true.

I've seen the truth of it in the answer that I've received far out of proportion to the feeble thing that I've offered up. Now you know what in your crisis moments when prayer is most urgent all you will be able to offer up is a feeble prayer know that the father is such that he receives it as being the very prayer of his own son and will give you a lavish answer and when you hear that and know that you know what you can do you can become grateful for such a God and such a father who is not a seeded critic of evaluating. I'll take this prayer and I'll reject that one. He receives it all as honoring to himself and gives lavish answer to all.

What a God! What a father!

How deserving not only of our appreciation our gratitude our love and out of that will spring praise and worship and out of which comes true service and fear. Come on you saints this is the foundation.

Amen. Amen.

Pray without ceasing call upon God the father it's your summons it's your privilege there's a grace. I've within the last about five or six years I've been made aware that and this is a this is a phenomenon to me that I've been made aware that the lord has answered and granted things that I never prayed for but I simply thought like I passed by something I think in my mind oh how nice but that's all out there just think how nice and then boom he gave it to me or you know wanting to go to Africa you know for so long but I just always thought and I never prayed it but he granted my thoughts that were deep belongings I guess they were so deep I never thought to bring them to the surface to create the holy spirit down there searching all that stuff out and it's amazing to me that is so gracious to me for him to grant even just these desires. I'm surprised that the answers I've received when more times than not I do not pray to the father I prayed for the son because I had a hang up about the word father for which I had not a comfort and an ease it was easier for me to pray to the lord though the lord has said pray to the father in my name I have haven't up till now been able to do it or have been instructed to do it now I'm being instructed and I believe that heretofore my prayers will be punctuated in the name of the father I will call upon the father and the name of the son and I believe I will receive abundantly more than what I have lost by that failure the father wants to be acknowledged he's the pivoting hub he's he's very God and we do him disservice and neglect the triunity of God and the glory of the Godhead when we omit the centerpiece of that Godhead who is the father merely to give tribute to the son or to the spirit is to ignore that threefold cord and the God who sends both son and spirit so father must be restored to his elementary place and it is there where we have failed and the enemy has discouraged it and has allowed the failure of our earthly relationships with fathers to discourage our heavenly relationship with the father so I said to someone at the break must we be continually scarred and what's the word crippled because we had unhappy relationship with the father or no relationship at all does that mean we're going to be crippled for the rest of our christian life and incapable of calling upon God the father when we're summoned so to do and see all of the benevolence that comes with that call you're only a cripple to the degree that you want to remain one but you don't have to you could be raised up from that crippling condition and learn about the beauty of fatherhood from the very source itself and be more compassionate in the in your attitude to that father who has failed you lest you find yourself duplicating him in your own conduct amen uh thinking of something i've read and i think it was the maiden power of the soul he's commenting on the lord's crib that's actually when Jesus is instructed and something i've not thought about before but it ties in i think he makes an interesting uh brings the attention to to our father who art in heaven and i thought as he goes on and describes the importance of that little segment how often i have begun to pray lord i pray against the situation or i pray and i'm really subverting or bypassing the father and i'm not even aware that i'm doing it and i begin to engage the city or tent to engage the situation and i thought what he suggested in the book that that is there for a very strategic reason that we are to remember that he is the person of the father i'm grateful that that's where he is our father which art in heaven because in calling upon you in heaven i'm having an opportunity for a linkage with heaven and all that heaven implies which i would lose if i were praying more horizontally i'm glad that you're in heaven because the calling upon you there brings me in a way into that reality so that the day might come by the consistent calling i can say with Paul i have my citizenship in heaven heaven is more than the geographical location it's the ultimate locus of reality and glory and honor and beauty and holiness so praise God that would call upon God the father of which art in heaven it's more than just a little designation he knows where he is why does he have us to say that because in the saying we're transported in some measure by faith into that realm of reality which needs to be brought into the earth and for which the church is wanting and lackluster we're not exhibiting enough of the heavenly dimension because we have not made sufficient recourse to it through prayer to our father which aren't in heaven hey this is something there's a wisdom to this there's a there's a remarkable sanity there's a genius this is not just God whipping together a few things like how to pray there's a design there's an ultimate wisdom there's a love and a benevolence could you see it God wants heavenliness into our earthly life but God knows how much it's needed and how drab and inadequate is the best of what we're able to perform if it has not a heavenly quotient so when he says here here's how to pray call upon your father which art in heaven because in the doing something comes back to you from heaven that will find this expression to hallow not only his name but your own life activity family relationship church ministry and service it saves us from the grimness of just abstract mechanical christianity this is a grace you dear saints much hinges but if you don't exercise it if you refuse to speak you choose silence you will not pray you will not call then you void and neglect the remarkable benevolence that is life-changing and you'll eternally regret it so get off your dead pump and repent for your silence repent for pouting and keeping it and God with my father failed me too therefore i'm not going to bow to that father get over that choose to honor choose to respect choose to exercise the privilege and grace to call ask his forgiveness as one of the first graces for your too long silence for your too long neglect of respect for him and for his authority especially as you've had opportunity both to see and touch and honor to the earth and men whom he has set before you amen repent and come alive in the spirit which is the grace to call to pray to have gratitude thankfulness to praise worship and be a christian this is the foundation shall we pray come on let's give God thanks and gratitude for so great grace for a father which art in heaven and gives us call upon him in that place where we might receive his very grace and benevolence saving us from grim earthliness even when we're correct thank you lord precious God oh my God this is love lord this is love from the father as only the father can give it thank you lord what a God you are we've not seen you this way thank you my God you didn't give us a little formula a little mechanical glib thing you gave us our holy mandate that we have the right to say God father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name in the earth thank you lord in my own life forgive me my silence lord forgive me my pent-up constipation staggered pool dead cold indifferent lacking in affection and warmth and lacking it for your children as well as for their father forgive me lord it's unbecoming to me as a christian i repent of it spring up loose springs of life in me lord that i can turn to you and call and receive in that call in very grace to be what i ought to let him hear you say turn the session into an event while you're internalizing taking the heart and praying deal with pray in german pray in bulgarian and in the last analysis pray in ponds give praise and worship in the heavenly language for the heavenly purpose no other prayer is ultimately adequate thank you lord for that privilege which we have neglected in being cold and indifferent and quiet when we should be speaking thank you lord cast out for that very reason and come to communities where they were free and welcome to speak and do not we might as well have remained where we were if we choose to be as silent here as we was we were compelled to be there give him your voice give him your praise give him your worship your heavenly father and he'll add the dimension from Jesus beyond what you're able to thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord holy holy holy is our God and our father what grace what mercy what love what patience what that you have waited so long my God thank you lord oh holy one oh our own will that will not threaten thank you thank you oh proud proud men defiant rebellious who will not allow God oh lord this is unGodliness thank you oh the great apostle spoke in tongues more than you all because he was the most grateful of all because he was the most thankful because he knew that every grace that he had and knowledge and wisdom and understanding authority came to him from above even from the throne of heaven even from God the father thank you my God oh thank you lord thank you lord more praise more gratitude more love more appreciation thank you lord more heartbroken gasps and chokes and splutters that is greater than eloquence more groanings that cannot be uttered thank you lord oh precious God oh lord oh lord this is the foundation which the apostles and the prophets brought to the church their knowledge of God the father as God and awakened thankfulness and gratitude to those who are dead in their religiosity thank you lord this is the foundation of foundations and we're asking that it be revived and restored before we go any further thank you heaven more heaven my God thank you lord oh we bless you thank you my God father i thank you that you received me as a son thank you father i thank you man increase the knowledge excuse me listen to me i'm receiving the voice let it be received lord father i pray for my brothers the hunter eyes i want to encourage them lord i'll lift them up father to you this day lord Jesus any fear of failure lord let us under guard them with strength from your throne rings today lord that they can be received and honored by your touch lord today lord let them get beyond themselves once again to be received as sons father for their weak where we're weak we're strong father let us under guard one another let us under guard one another sons and daughters are the most high you're the one you're the one father you said that you received this is nothing of ourselves what's nothing of ourselves it's nothing of ourselves father the word is coming forth from your throne lord let us continue to take even more even more even more lord let's not get out three one dribble leave us lord without receiving it and taking it father even as water drips on the plant and comes down and feeds a little birds let that kind of drippings be on us lord and may we not despise them the smallest drip may we take it into ourselves for you to receive it and to give it back to you quickly quickly lord you come with healing in your wings father for your son you've come you've come let me take you thank you lord consider what it is that the centurion saw at the cross when Jesus yielded up his spirit he said truly this man is the son of God i don't understand it but he saw something in that moment when Jesus said no man takes my life i give it up when he yielded up his spirit when he gave up that last act is the quintessential act of sonship it is giving up it is surrendering it is yielding and this dumb centurion recognized this is the son of God this act revealed him and so what is the essence of a son one who yields up and if you can't yield up your voice in prayer how shall you yield up your spirit in death how how can you show ultimate sonship when you're not showing immediate sonship which is in essence the same thing a yielding up and a giving up of pride of restriction or inhibition or whatever it is there's a yielding up your voice in praise in prayer in gratitude that is at the essence of what it means to be a son son is an active pursuit an active reality it's not a static designation be a son and yield up your voice without feeling without waiting for the payment the payoff the benefit because he's the father he's holy and he's deserving of your acknowledgement yield up your voice father father of glory you provided your son who is the captain of our salvation is leading many sons unto glory and we thank you lord i thank you from the bottom of my heart lord as you condescended to us this day in your wisdom and your wisdom is your glory and this has been glorious you've condescended even to us in your mercy and your mercy is your glory to us you've condescended in your meekness and your meekness is your glory and your grace unto us that we may invoke the name of father is your very glory so we thank you lord that you're leading these sons into glory and lord i must exclaim to your wisdom and to your glory oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who has known the mind of the lord or who has become his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be repaid to him or of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen thank you lord anyway thank you lord hear the prayer of Paul in the book of ephesians in chapter three for this cause i bound my knees unto the father of our lord Jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he the father would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ might dwell in your hearts by faith that you're being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God he bows his knee to the father that he would grant you according to his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit all went to the source and we need also to go thank you my God thank you my God precious God lord we don't know as we want to know grant us lord imbue our hearts our spirits with a sense of your ponderous reality because that reality is the key to all reality and if we have not that reality we have no reality so lord we're asking imbue us with yourself as father supreme God the heart of the trinity thank you lord who glories in the sun who sends the spirit who is full of riches who is full of patience my God lord help us as father my God teach us and that we might be something like that and express something like that for you are the eternal prototype we cannot know fatherhood we cannot express it until we catch glimpse of what it is in its primal and true and eternal state as it is with you and me thank you lord thank you my God repair that loss and revive my God thank you both of us we think we must earn something father show us that it's already given that it's a gift to be given and not something to be earned but are coming on to you the gift that you supply to us for those of us who have a vague view of father or even a negative view of father break through this old stuff to give us an understanding that a relationship with you is something to be highly desired not something to be earned or grudgingly come to put that in our hearts or to give us the desire to just spend time with you thank you thank you for making the way for people that we can approach you thank you thank you lord
