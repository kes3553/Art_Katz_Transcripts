Extravagant Love - Art Katz

and I'm far from any kind of authority and I'm far from any kind of authority my prayer is that the Lord will minister to me this morning as much as you my prayer is that the Lord will minister to me this morning as much as you that we all of us together will be on the receiving end because our need is desperate and few of us have any actual knowledge of this subject and in fact, not that I'm the most extensive reader around which is not that I am the most extensive reader that exists but there seems to be a lack of really profound Christian literature on this subject and I think that the answer is not to be found because there's a lack of writing skills But I don't think the answer is that there's a lack of writing skills and I don't think the answer is that there's a lack of writing skills but just a lack of actual knowledge and experience of this love So I would recommend to you the one from whom I am reading this morning, Basilea Slink I've not found anyone like her when it comes to the knowledge of first love also called bridal love and just again to remind you that the condition in which we shall be found at the very end and the consummation of all of God's redemptive work at the final end of the ages is as a bride adorned for the bridegroom I don't think that we should ever lose sight of that It could easily happen when we become embroiled in what is immediately before us the necessities for evangelism, the issues of discipleship the needs that are in the world but I think it's good to keep our eyes toward heaven look up Jesus said when these things begin to come to pass, look up and these things have already begun to come to pass the horrible fulfillment of the end time things which makes our looking up all the more urgent and necessary setting our affections on the things above not because it's a technical requirement but because it's where Christ is don't you admire the genius of God don't you admire the genius of God that he has so established things that no kind of mechanical discipleship will suffice only love any other obedience will run out but only love goes beyond only love will compel you to look up and keep your affections set there it cannot be imposed as a mechanical requirement it is the logic of love itself it inheres in love it is built in to love so there is one requirement foremost above every other consideration we must become passionate lovers of God we have got to know in our actual experience what bridal love is also called first love first because it puts him before every other consideration and bridal because it has eyes only for him because it's intense and burning nothing in the world has prepared us for this even our previous shabby romantic experiences even our previous shabby romantic experiences the casual matter-of-fact spirit of the world the everyday, practical spirit of the world this business-as-usual mentality this ordinary business-as-usual mentality casual and passing relationships have not fitted us for this kind of intense love have not fitted us for this kind of intense love so let me read a little bit about it from Bachelier Sling's book so let me read a little bit about it from Bachelier Sling's book I wish I could read it all from cover to cover for you I wish I could read it all from cover to cover for you because she describes how she was quite successful in ministry because she describes how she was quite successful in ministry many doors were opened to her everywhere she was an admirable Bible teacher serving God diligently very content with her successful Christian life enjoying the applause and the commendation of others enjoying the applause and the commendation of others until God convicted her of one thing she had not obeyed the commandment especially the first thou shalt love no ifs, no ands, or buts, thou shalt and not any kind of love either but with all thy heart all thy heart all thy mind all thy strength the total call of a total God who has answered that commandment how many of us now recognize the impossibility of the faith this is not some clever alternative to Judaism or Judaism with a new wrinkle this is altogether a devastatingly other thing impossible to human attainment it must be of God through God for God that he be all in all for this very bridal love that we are discussing itself comes from him it's heavenly therefore it's burning because God himself is a consuming fire it cannot be fabricated from the earth not a matter of personal temperament it can't be drummed up or worked up it comes from above and it returns to above through vessels who are open to receive it who will put away their earthly contents where the flesh or that enmity with the spirit is lustrous against the spirit it is always in contention with the spirit the good is always the enemy of the perfect and our light kind of Christian affection our ability to give each other little hugs our ability to give each other little hugs and how you doing brother is always contending against this pure and burning love which would far eclipse it I was sharing with Paul and Wilbert at lunch yesterday about our community in northern Minnesota how the lord has sent us some really precious saints their very coming to us is already the evidence of true commitment who wants to live in 30-40 degrees below zero weather and winter is the largest season of the year it doesn't end until May and it begins in October so people don't come to us for little life vacations let alone give up their homes, their security, their businesses and their private lifestyle let alone give up their homes, their businesses and their private lifestyle to make ice in the winter and mud in the sleds and mosquitoes in the summer but there is no exception to those who have come they have not cracked up within weeks or months of their coming they have not cracked up within weeks or months of their coming where the seams have burst and the stuffing has come out of their little Christian dolls precious charismatic saints they had it all together they talked profoundly about the body of Christ the love of God ministry until the pressures became intense the intensity of this daily life together and the little porcelain figurine begins to crack and then come undone altogether and out of that death comes the reality of a resurrection life people who show themselves so kind, so loving for the first week I wondered to what degree we are all in a condition of deception that our true condition simply has not been revealed because we have not been together intensely enough and long enough for God to reveal it I would say the greatest obstacle to this first and bridal love is our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have our own unwillingness to give up the earthly counterpart our own unwillingness to give up our earthly counterpart it is only in the place of suffering and death that it happens and it is a suffering and death when it does happen that darkness comes over the earth before there is a breakthrough a pressing through the veil of the greater glory what is this bridal love, this first love? it has eyes for the bridegroom alone it is the end of all flirting roving eyes why do we carry on like that? because our hearts are not yet filled to the uttermost and there is room for a little something extra and we are scanning the horizon to see where it might come because our hearts are not filled to overflowing with the love of him alone I tell you children, I did not know what the word filled meant as many times as I have used it as a Pentecostal until I was travelling through the American midwest in the harvest season it was last year they had what they called a bumper crop, an enormous success in the harvest and the corn cribs were filled up to overflowing and were piled over on the ground in yet another heap and then I understood what it meant to be filled even coming to the brim is not enough it has got to flow over and maybe this is exactly where our Christian life falls short many of us are far below the full line in love and remember that it is a faith which works by love how many of us have not seen it working? not because we lack the faith but because we lack the love I can almost fall on my face right now before God at the genius of God who insists upon the two together and will not let us be sufficient with the one without the other and he will not let us be sufficient with the one without the other can you imagine what we would be if we were great men and women of faith without love? it would be a horror of horrors some kind of bristling spiritual efficiency a pharisaical know-it-all ready to do but loveless I'm glad that God insisted it's the faith that works by love are you filled to overflowing? and maybe it can be said that we really do not touch the world we can pressure our vehicles with stickers and bumper slogans and all these things we can have campaigns to wear blue in the faith and make our knuckles bloody from knocking on doors and we really have not impressed the world until the fragrance of his love overflows to me dear children, this is a first and primary need it has taken me 15 years to see it and I could kick myself that I didn't realize why the first commandment is the first commandment thou shalt love what good are the other nine? and indeed how can they be fulfilled if we have not yet met this first requirement it's only love that gives the enablement it's only love that provokes and motivates us to be faithful in all the requirements of God God has put it first but we have put it last and we need to reestablish our priorities and seek first this love to the exclusion of all else and I have told God again and again and again not only for myself but for my community and above every other consideration this one thing should mark us that we are passionate lovers of God I think it will save us from every error and everything else will follow it has eyes for the bridegroom alone such an absoluteness seems utterly lacking in my own life hasn't God been speaking to us about the things that are absolute? total and unconditional above and below such a severity, such a clear demarcation in his perspective a line of separation but not in our own view for which reason we have not recognized this need of a total utterness toward God an utterness toward God an absoluteness toward God you think in your own experience when have you met such a believer that displays this kind of absoluteness and utterness toward God who is absolutely impervious to the world who is immune to the world he simply cannot be attracted it's all the same to him to abound, to abate to increase or to decrease it's all the same to him to abound, to abate to increase or to decrease what kind of a car he's in, when he's driving, when he eats or doesn't eat what he wears or doesn't wear, what he has or doesn't have single eyes toward God such an utterness this has about it, the flavor of things apostolic this has about it, the flavor of things apostolic can I read a little quotation from Oswald Chambers? can I read a little quotation from Oswald Chambers? a saint is a sacramental personality a saint is a sacramental personality sacramental, sacramenteel, is that Dutch? I don't know that it's sacramental it's a catholic word, sacramental sacramenteel, do you understand that? a saint is a sacramental personality a saint is a sacramental personality where did Oswald Chambers get that? from heaven one through whom the presence of God comes to others one through whom the presence of God comes to others I had written this a few months ago and this morning by accident my eye fell upon it again I had written this a few months ago I added a further question What then should it's corporate expressions be?

what then should it's corporate expressions be?

can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities a whole body that has this utterness toward God marked by first bridal love watch out world they would not be able to resist the glory of such a people this love gives up all others it is a spin-thrift love a lavish love that doesn't count the pennies one of the amusing, if not sad and melancholy experiences that men like me face continually is the payment we receive for services rendered how can you put a price on the ministry?

how can you put a price on the ministry? shall it be so much per day? shall it be so much per day? so much per lecture? how do we evaluate its worth? shall we pay according to need? shall we pay according to need?

you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches? you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches? you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches? they're very... they are very minimal they are very minimal they're satisfied to be adequate I almost feel like a man being paid for his services I almost feel like a man being paid for his services but there is nothing extravagant about their gesture it's stingy, it's narrow and my sadness is not for me that I'm being denied because the Lord sees to me aboundingly I'm sad for their sake and this is especially true in Europe because they have not learned how to give they don't know what extravagance means because the kind of extravagance that is pleasing in the Lord's sight is not something which you can be taught or instructed it's the overflow of love the love to give that must give so I see this as a symptom of lovelessness a worldly mechanical attitude so much paid for services rendered not the fragrance of Christ it's the stink of the world of a church that needs to be profoundly converted to the lavish love of God that gives everything to the beloved I want to examine with you this morning a little episode in Luke the 7th chapter do you remember when Jesus was invited in the 36th verse to come to the house of a Pharisee to eat and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him waiting for the Lord to come and the Lord said to her, Jesus, come to the house of a Pharisee to eat and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment and when the Pharisee which had bitten him sort he spoke within himself saying, this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner Jesus answering said unto him, Simon I have something to say unto thee and I think that the Lord has also something to say unto us you want me to read it? no, I think that they can follow there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, see thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which on many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that said it met with and began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace it's a remarkable and precious episode there are two others like it in the gospels in all three episodes a woman is the chief actor you know how foolish women can get they're not practical like us fellows they're so reckless and mindless they'll waste anything this is my single greatest issue with my wife she just does not have a proper Jewish sense of economy we have guests and she's lavish I would have put out just a little salad, a little of this no two salads, three salads coffee and tea cake and cookies cake and cookies it's amazing how that kind of lavishness will drive a man to a fury so I really understand the reaction of the disciples in one of these episodes when the woman came with the alabaster box and broke it it says they were filled with indignation as I said so what purpose is this waste? why this ointment could have been sold and the money could have been distributed to the poor could have bought literature or tracts they couldn't understand this act they were offended by it and it is still true to this very day I met a precious young Christian on this trip that when he first came to the Lord he came in first love the Lord swept him off his feet the Lord threw him upside down he was so in love with the Lord that he would walk against a wall he was already in heaven but you know what the more experienced Christians say you'll get over this you'll come down to normal and sure enough when they said this enough he did they could not stand to see someone so lost in love to God it intimidated them they wanted to make him as they were you'll get over this it's true to this day the disciples have indignation at this kind of lavish extravagance that pours itself out upon the Lord and is not satisfied with just the minimal requirement or obligation this Pharisee thought he was in real sport the other Pharisees wouldn't touch Jesus with a ten-foot pole he was quite an emancipated fellow quite liberal and he was going to have this character into his house to eat and he fed him I'm sure it was adequate but he was quite proud of his largesse of soul, his hospitality but a stinking woman came a putrid sinner the Amplified Bible says an especially wicked sinner and he was very happy the Amplified Bible says an especially wicked sinner and she couldn't even bring herself to stand before the Lord she stood weeping behind him and she washed his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair I don't know if you ladies can even understand this today but there was a generation when a woman's hair was her crowning glory it was the best she had and with that she wiped the feet of the Lord what shall we say also of tears? maybe that's the best we have also it comes from the inward place I'm not talking about some shabby sentimental tears this wasn't just a tear she washed the feet of the Lord with her tears it was a profuse overflow it was an... it was an exceedingly great sufficient to wash a man's feet from the dust of the road I always thought that the scriptures were just being poetic here and really who can cry that profusely this is a profound deep inner weeping which of us has ever come to that kind of profound breaking in the depths of our being and it shows I can almost look over this room and know who has had a measure of breaking and who has not do you remember what I quoted to you from Phinney yesterday? he wouldn't even dream to travel with any man who has not been broken down before the Lord within the space of no more than three weeks as a frequent and a recurring experience this is not yet the case this is not just a once and for all but God calling an entire people to live in the spirit of repentance because the more truly spiritual they become the more they recognize the subtlety and the depth of their being and can say with Paul, I am the chief of sinners it's amazing the kind of conviction that God can bring to sexual I've had an occasion to visit with Basilia Schlink several occasions and I spoke to her about this I said you speak about the necessity for daily repentance you know how direct we Jews are but tell me, do you experience this yourself? you impeccable saint you spotless glory you radiant heavenly being are you trying to tell me that you repent daily? that you are a sinner daily, that you see the necessity for repentance? she was amazed at my question but of course she said give me an example of what you repented yesterday and when she gave me the example I repented because it was not anything that I would have thought of as sin it wasn't any flagrant violation of any kind no real harm was done by it it was only just a little attitude just an inward disposition of heart that was a little bit sullen it passed in a moment but she broke and repented over it we had a couple of confessions last night of people who had a critical spirit they confessed it but that they break and they weep over it maybe we need to see as God sees that in his sight there is no such thing as a small sin I want to tell you that last night was the most difficult night of my ministry before you in these days I was inwardly struggling and laboring the flow of God was being impeded I don't know how to explain this I came very prayed up very expectant believing largely from God for great things I came believing that God would do great things but we didn't get them I wonder if so much as one or two with a critical spirit are enough I wonder if one or two with a critical spirit are enough to affect the flow and to grieve the spirit of God if it has not been dismissed by an authentic repentance and sorrow if it has not been dismissed by an authentic repentance and sorrow it seems that the experience of men in true revivals supports this the man who wrote the definitive book on the revivals in China it is enough for a whole meeting that there is one man who has a wicked spirit and who ruins the whole meeting and then the awakening did not continue until this person really broke and grieved or the Lord removed him how little do we understand these things? because we do not understand the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit because we have had only a functional and utilitarian attitude about the Spirit of God because we only have an attitude that wants to make use and really only sees the functioning of the Holy Spirit only thinking about what He can do for us and through us but not contemplating Him in love love is sensitive toward the beloved love is sensitive toward the beloved it has a purpose and it feels when the mood of love changes love is very careful not to bring the slightest offense how little have we had this kind of loving attitude toward the Spirit of God not realizing that the Spirit of God is the very inner essence of Him how much greater reverence should we have for Him and be careful not to grieve Him by earthly and fleshly attitudes that are contrary to His essence and personality which is burning love I didn't think that it would be possible to wash someone's feet with tears but this brother says that in the Chinese revivals the floors were wet with the tears of the saints and I saw it recently in Sweden a young girl bent over a chair and when she lifted her head the seat was wet with tears and how many of us here has God succeeded in breaking us up in the deep? where these precious tears are to be found how many of us ourselves are like an alabaster box very nice to look upon singing all of the appropriate choruses very expert in the current vocabulary and terminology impressive outward vessels thinking to serve God from that basis and not recognizing that something has to come from the deep and not recognizing that something has to come from the deep and that can only flow out of brokenness I don't know as much about evangelism as you that's not my calling but I just want to suggest what I think will have much to do with God's end time evangelism but I just want to suggest what I think will have much to do with God's end time evangelism described in 2 Corinthians 2 in the 14th and the 16th verses 14 to the 16th verses 14 to the 16th verses 14 to the 16th verses now thanks be unto God who always causes the triumph in Christ and then comes this tremendous statement and make it manifest the savor or the fragrance of his knowledge by us in every place remember seeing that lately remember seeing that lately isn't that a strange expression the fragrance of his knowledge the fragrance of his knowledge we never think of knowledge as a fragrance let alone that it should be made manifest by us let alone that it should be made manifest by us in every place have you ever thought about the knowledge of him as a fragrance have you ever thought about the knowledge of him as a fragrance are you really disappointing me this morning I thought you were kind of a two-fisted rugged disciple type but this emphasis on fragrances surprises me but this emphasis on fragrances surprises me this is too feminine a category this is too feminine but still it says in the Gospel that the woman who came and broke the alabaster the whole house was filled with the fragrance how many of us are perfectly correct and very right in our conduct and activity and service but there is no fragrance the fragrance of the knowledge of him that can really turn the heads of men when mere words fail have you really pondered what Jesus said to the disciples have you really pondered what Jesus said to the disciples leave this woman alone for she has done a good work on me I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work he even went further where this good news is preached in the world this that this woman has done shall be spoken as a memorial unto her this that this woman has done shall be spoken as a memorial unto her the difference between the attitude of the disciples and the attitude of Jesus the difference between the attitude of the disciples and the attitude of Jesus just as great as the difference between Jesus and Peter in yesterday's message Jesus celebrated this act wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed are you conscious of how many gospels are being proclaimed today are you conscious of how many gospels are being proclaimed today gospels of prosperity gospels of self interest accept Jesus and you'll receive these benefits accept Jesus and you'll receive these benefits but where this gospel shall be proclaimed that makes manifest the knowledge of him what was the greatest revelation of the knowledge of him in my opinion it came on the cross in his suffering and brokenness something was exhibited in that suffering in that moment of ultimate agony in that moment of ultimate agony and overwhelmed even the Roman centurion who was standing at the foot of the cross while the proud Psyrothaical Jews were crying come down from the cross and we'll believe you this dumb centurion this mere gentile who had no religious training a pagan of pagans who had seen emperors deified as God in great pomp and ceremony saw this pitiful naked figure on the cross saw this pitiful naked figure on the cross and the ultimate agony of his suffering yielding up his ghost and he cried out surely this is the son of God something was revealed even to this unthinking club that only suffering can reveal something somehow gets right to the heart of the issue cuts through subterfuge and deceit and concealment something in the suffering of Jesus and the way that he died as a broken vessel poured out for the world that brought some knowledge into the soul of this Roman that he was compelled to cry out surely this is the son of God the event was so enormous that even the dead had to come out of their graves and enter into the holy city it rent the veil of the temple and cracked the stones and it will do so again and again as often as God and his people will reveal him in their brokenness it's the ultimate revelation to an unbelieving world to an unbelieving world of God as he really is nothing reveals the love of God so much as God crucified wherever this Gospel shall be proclaimed in all the world this that this woman hath done shall be spoken of because this act of hers this act of lavish love this extravagance that was not just careful to screw up the cap and spill out a few drops this utter recklessness which smashed the box and poured lavishly out over the head of the Lord so that the whole house was filled with the fragrance is a revelation of the heart of the Gospel itself of the heart of God himself and it cannot be demonstrated by those whose alabaster boxes are still together who are just measuring out a few appropriate drops giving the minimal requirements and have not yet come to the extravagance of love Jesus said to the Pharisee, I came into your house and you gave me no water for my feet or you failed even to give the minimal obligations you didn't even give me any kind of a cheap oil for my head you didn't even greet me with a kiss on my cheek but this woman this especially wicked sinner has not ceased from the moment I have come in to wash my feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair and have anointed me with this oil and have anointed me with this oil tell me there were two men who owed a debt one owed more and one owed less and which of the two shall love that creditor more who forgives their debt and which of the two shall love that creditor more who forgives their debt oh he said the one who has the greater debt Jesus said you've answered correctly he who has been forgiven much loves much wouldn't it be an advantage for us if we were especially wicked sinners and knew it as this woman knew it and knew it as this woman knew it because she knew herself as she really was she also knew who he was whose feet were bathed with her tears but a religious Pharisee who was especially correct did everything right and had a proper understanding he said if this man were a prophet he would know but the one who sat at his table was far greater than a prophet but the correct religionist could not see it he could not recognize Jesus because he could not see himself that is a revelation that comes only to especially wicked sinners who are broken over it and are weeping with gratitude for the forgiveness that is extended to them by him whose feet they wash by him whose feet they wash when Christ came into your house how did you receive him and how have you received him since have you accorded to him the minimal things the necessary obligations the minimal amount of prayer the appropriate amount of service you've been feeding him, you've had him to your table maybe you've greeted him with a peck on the cheek a little kiss on the cheek I came into your house and you gave me no water for my feet you didn't greet me with a kiss you gave me no oil for my hair how have you treated the Lord since he came into your house most of us are minimal we get by we give the appropriate amount that's required how can you measure this really what have you been pouring out on the body of Christ remember it says that she poured this upon his head but when he spoke of it he said she has poured this upon my body what is poured upon the head is upon the body and what is poured upon the body is poured upon the head what have you poured out upon the body in the extravagance of love that has filled the room with the fragrance even the world knows how to be sociable and can be fraternal you can give a back slap and a bear hug how are you doing brothers but there's no fragrance of the knowledge of him that is made manifest by us in every place in every place that this love has overwhelming power to go on even when obedience has spent itself love continues on it flows over because this love joins us with the bridegroom this bride that is adorned for the bridegroom that comes down from heaven this bride that is adorned for the bridegroom is having the glory of God being like him because she's joined with him in love any other kind of joining is illicit, illegal sinful it's an intimate union with the Lord by which you receive of his life and make it manifest again he'll not be satisfied with a peck on the cheek he waits for lovers who'll be joined with him intimately has that union taken place with you or have you just rendered to him the minimal obligation since he came into your house he who has been forgiven much, loves much that's the key to this love you can't pump it up you can't manufacture this it flows out with the tears of brokenness for repentance from those who have great debts and cannot pay them who are especially wicked sinners we really have a choice before us this morning I asked you last night, who do you more resemble, Nicodemus or Jesus the proud Pharisee or the man of spirit I might well ask you the question this morning who do you more resemble the correct Pharisee the religious who thought he was doing very generously to have him into his arms or the broken prostitute who washed his feet with her tears or the broken prostitute who washed his feet with her tears I'll tell you how naive I am I don't think that there's any middle course I think it's the one or the other I don't think that there's any other category I don't think that there's any other category you're proud and Pharisee correct, minimal doing our obligations or we're broken and extravagant and lavish in our love he said to her thy faith has saved thee, go in peace faith is more than just subscribing to the correct doctrine true faith is an extravagant act of love that has recognized who he is that has recognized who he is because it sees who we are because this love also sees who we are this translation says your faith has saved you, go enter into your peace in freedom from all of the distresses that are experienced as a result of sin the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin this is the answer to those of you who are still being harassed these days have been filled with confessional sin in a kind of minimal way in the sense of fulfilling a required obligation in the sense of fulfilling a required obligation but it is not a confession that has been extravagant lavish until in tears that would enable you to go in peace in freedom from all of the distresses in freedom from all of the vexations vexations in an annoyance of strife that are experienced as a result of sin it is interesting that all of the disciples fled Jesus in his ultimate suffering but I form a prostitute with that across wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us to learn that one former prostitute like that in the extravagance of her love which comes out of a true repentance which comes out of a true repentance which comes out of a true repentance from a particularly bad sin that he did more to bless the Lord to delight his heart and to make him known than all of our acts of discipleship love is the answer first love you can't pump it up your earthly thing is in the way your light human affection you need to repent of it as an inadequate substitute for that which is divine there is a connection between repentance and love there is a connection between repentance and love may we see it by the eye of the spirit and not be proud religionists who cannot see who call Jesus teacher who call Jesus teacher if this man were a prophet and dignified for the man as well as for the woman therefore not going into may the house be filled with the fragrance the house of God in the end days beyond all our programs and all our activities all of our doing for God may this one thing characterize us above all the house is filled with the fragrance of the knowledge of him made manifest by us in every place out of our own brokenness have you asked the Lord for that?

have you paid your debts, can you?

or yours were not as great as hers she was an especially wicked sinner and we're not ours were the smallest sins critical spirit let us see as the Lord sees and to weep over it only the Lord can perform this to those who are yielded to him for his precious breaking process above all of the glorious experiences that I have known in God in 15 years enormous victories in ministry great breakthroughs in proclaiming the word there's nothing that I cherish more than when the Lord brings this breaking I remember one time I was actually under the table at a banquet I was a mess to look at I had exhausted all of my handkerchiefs and tissues my face was awash with tears I was mopping my face with the tablecloth that left over the table I was under the table, I didn't want to be seen of men I had an inward breaking by God and some great men of God whose shoes I was unworthy to unlace looked at the table cloth could I help you brother? and I burst again had the expression of his love when you glimpse the love of God it breaks your heart may he do it for us this morning may we rise above me, electors electors, electors, electors may we receive the word of God as an event that breaks us that we see by the eye of the spirit we are especially wicked in this state to be a prostitute is to be especially wicked a woman who has given her body to men for gains but to be a proud religioner correct and self-satisfied utterly assured in his knowledge who is only minimal to God and to God's people is worse shall we pray?
