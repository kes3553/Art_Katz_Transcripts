Walking in the Rest of God - Art Katz

walk thou before me and be thou perfect I used to wonder now Lord are you goading us or is that some vague standard thought which we should aspire or do you actually mean that we ought to be perfect as you are perfect well as I get old in the Lord I believe it's the last nothing less than sheer perfection and isn't that ironic that it comes at a time when every standard is falling about us as the world becomes increasingly slapdash haphazard vague approximate every kind of standard declines and every service is beginning to break down and anything goes God insists on his perfection so the world grows darker we grow brighter I've come back recently from 30 days in Europe I've never seen days so crammed full beginning in Germany and going on for Yugoslavia and concluding in Switzerland I have to say that all began with a vision which the Lord imparted to me and a German brother about four or five years ago which I had quietly kept in my heart waiting for the hour that the Lord would begin to fulfill it one of the lessons that I'm learning is because God gives a vision does not mean that it's to be immediately realized among the other reproaches that we experience in this day is the accusation oh you can't you dreamer what about your vision that you said this is going to happen didn't you say that God gave you a conference at Columbia University and he said and he gave you the explicit name Shekinah and if you're kind of 74 at the same University where the student rebellions broke out some years ago and that the glory of God was going to fall on the day of Pentecost Shavuot the Jewish holiday and Orthodox Jews would be sitting in that audience and they'd be overwhelmingly zapped by God in form of faces and clouds of what he's done didn't you say that was a vision that God gave you yes I said that how come then it wasn't realized well it wasn't but just before the conference concluded we were instructed that we were to have another conference in 75 and another one in 76 and unbeknownst to us it was not to be a one-time thing but an annual event I don't think that Paul ever did see that Macedonian remember that one who said come over and help us he saw a woman at a riverside and he said the and he saw a prison keeper in a scroungy bunch of inmates but he never did see the men revealed to him in the vision so I'm learning a thing or two about God's visions we need not expect its immediate realization or even its literal fulfillment but if it suffices to initiate us in a course of activity that shall bring about the fullness of God's intention that's all that matters I hope I'm not speaking in mysteries already God gave me a vision a burden pertaining to Germany the same people whom I could not look straight in the face when I was sent there as a GI almost a quarter of a century ago in the Korean War during when men were being hacked to pieces on Asiatic battlefields where I thought that I myself would end my absurd life because my name was cats and it came from the middle of the alphabet I went with others whose names began with in that portion to Germany instead of to Korea and that began in a love affair with the people whom I thought I would despise I couldn't help it though I tried to avert my gaze I saw the fantastic resemblances between Jewish and German life our Yiddish and their German language they're gonna use this type and our zest for good food good talk and all the things which they themselves also celebrate in fact strange enough I felt more at home in Germany than I had ever felt in Brooklyn in America I felt as a man without a country some kind of a kooky character a man out of joint and time and place but in medieval Germany with with the cobblestones once moved by the passage of feet over the centuries in the shadow of ancient cathedrals in towns that are redolent reeking from life then live in that unbroken continuity there I felt at home and so if you've read Ben Israel you know where the first chapter begins at that house where I went on Yom Kippur the day of Atonement which I thought to be a fit way to observe an important Jewish holy day that I myself was a vehement atheist and would never have found myself in a synagogue and there a God whom I did not know began to drop my heart and save me from stereotypes and simplistic notions of good guys and bad guys and begin me on a succession of steps that was to cultivate culminate in my salvation about a decade later I've had a long-standing love affair with Germany and the thing that God spoke to my heart about five years ago is this that the same people which Satan had used to cast the Jews into the physical fires would be the same people that he would use to keep them from the fires of his eternal judgment as Inger says how do you like them apples well that lay quietly in my heart and I loved it because they were so in keeping with what I understand to be the character of God just like him to take the most vicious and untoward events and acts of Satan and turn them to his glory I could think of the unspeakable celebration of Jews around the throne of the Lamb through endless periods of time rejoicing together with German saints who had occasioned their salvation by their prayer my mother to this day can't speak the word German it's so loathsome to her consideration and yet if this realization is true she may well be saved by some German saints supplicating and groaning in the spirit for her so they may never see each other on this side of eternity so I couldn't wait then when the Lord would begin to fulfill this we live for a year in Denmark and we traveled on a few occasions into Germany and not a single door open and I myself was not going to press one open someone came to me the other night but art what did I ever enjoy this service terrific preaching brother I'd love to hear you speak on prophecy I said well very likely you'll never have that occasion how come I don't have a single message on prophecy the guy was absolutely flabbergasted you're a Jew and you don't have a single message on prophecy no God has not opened that door and so you can live in and near a country and God has given you a burning vision and not a single door will open and it pleases God to keep you in obscurity and hiddenness until the moment of his perfect choosing comes how would you like to submit to that condition that seems to be the pattern in all scripture and Elijah kept in hiddenness and obscurity until the moment of God's choosing then he brings them forth to the central stage if I know anything about Jewish prophets or did he have this flesh did he want to go go go and he saw all of the prophets of God slain day by day in the increasingly filthy condition of the apostate Jewish people and he had to keep himself silent I know what an itchy had to leap out and say oh how long you did you remain in this condition choose either thing I don't know what else he would have said but in other words I was wishing he had an experience like that Hebrew University I watched a crowd of 300 students come together to watch a dancing and singing ensemble from a Christian Bible college in Wenatchee Washington Gentiles would never so much as later eyes on a Jew before they met me come to Israel completely uninstructed and do more work in four days than decades of conventional missionary endeavor and God opened doors at the Hebrew University Hadassah Hospital a home for convalescent soldiers from Yom Kippur war and a street meeting in Tel Aviv where the presence of God was enormous when I saw this crowd form my immediate impulse was to leap into the midst of them in the first law and say brethren the God of our fathers and go on but the Lord went zip now I'll tell you for those of us who are called to walk in the spirit the hardest thing may be the obscurity and the hiddenness and the silence until the moment of God's perfect choosing then he brings forth as Elijah is Joseph is Jesus and what he does in moments after that shakes the earth the timing of God is exquisite you say art how did you get to the Hadassah Hospital and to the to the Hebrew University did you write letters and make arrangements and wheel and deal not a stitch we went without any plans any communication nothing believing God that somehow it pleased him to send us and we were not tourists and so we sat at the Rome Airport on the hard concrete floor the plane was delayed and I was giving these young Bible college students some orientation for Israel and I noticed we were being observed by some of the passengers also waiting for the late flight and so when we were called we started to walk up the gangplank and one of these men came somehow alongside me and we got into a conversation and he told me how enormously impressed it was looking at these young people he said they look as if they've come out of the 19th century I know what I know what he meant by that there was an innocent about them they somehow were different from other young people in the world I said if you're impressed with them silence you ought to hear them singing see them dance I said how would you he told me by that time he was a professor at the Hebrew University how would you like to arrange something for them at the university all he said but that would be fine I got his phone number called three days later he's gonna make all the preparations and I called him and he said I I've done everything in my power impossible sent them a lot massacre this would take months to arrange the security measures are so extraordinary well I said I'm just sorry I said but listen what if they just came noontime and took out their instruments and began to sing and dance and if anybody wanted to listen they would stop and listen he said well sure try that we came that day with three busloads and we stopped at the gate with guys with Tommy guns machine guns they wanted to see our certificate I'll pass our permit and so they sent from it the hot shot to explain and I thought we don't have one what are you doing here well we were invited by a professor so-and-so no good you still have to have an official permit I said look my best Yiddish intonation look they've only come to bring mitzvah I think I even use my hands a little bit they've only come to bring blessing oh okay he said and we let him the three buses these kids unpacked their instruments and began singing at noon and within five minutes we had 300 Israeli students with their jaws agape listening to the goyim Gentiles praising the God of Israel and singing the songs of faith and joy we had been that morning earlier at Hadassah hospital and the kids have been talking about wanting to plant trees and leave something behind rather than take something out of Israel and I saw a sign with that blood donor and something my one click I began to give you blood yeah and so I went up to the official I said we have 30 Christians who want to give their blood for Israel and the official clock an occasional Jew maybe well padded but 30 Christians want to give their blood never heard of such a thing we came back that afternoon after the Hebrew University and they took us five or six at a time the rest of us waited in the hallway and they were just overwhelmed one of the kids said to me aren't you said you think they would mind if we sang in the hallway I thought at all I'll ask this doctor an American Jew who was looking at me clearly like cats what are you doing your cats are you know I said listen these kids want to sing do you think it's okay he said we're so grateful for what you're doing today we've never had such a response the hospital is yours do what you want so they began to sing and I'll tell you that with their voices they went in a of the glory of God through the corridor and it was only a matter of a moment I heard the loud clicking of heels and there she came a woman doctor with a white gown on I knew it I knew it she said you can't do this without going up to our floor and singing also and so she sent down a student nurse and when we finished giving our blood up we went we went from room to room what the war for hours praising God singing through the hallway laying the head laying hands on the sick worshiping God in the spirit praying for healing you can't the glory of God my scalp like six inches high off the top of my head and embracing and weeping and gray disconsolate faces hopeless and doomed beginning to break forth into smiles of hope and expectancy praying for infants that were doomed to die and just the glory of God moving to the car this never seems that you work and so it was at the hospital with the multiple amputees beautiful Jewish boys with one eye and one arm left hacked to pieces gray disconsolate broken and the doors burst open and come these Christian kids praising God in the beauty of His Holiness singing the songs of faith and joy and they begin to blink their eyes and what's this and falling on them with kisses and love and expressions of affection it was the presence of God coming to comfort his children when we left I draped my arm over one mutilated hack to pieces beautiful Jewish boy I said dear brother take this occasion of seeming tragedy to seek the face of the God of your fathers that he might convert it to joy in and out pow pow pow street meeting in Tel Aviv no preaching not one word living epistles and I was holding back the crowd we made room for these dancers you never saw more spiritual dancing dancing to the Psalms can you believe that and where a couple Israelis next to me were saying in Yiddish are these missionaries I said no these are going and whose heart is the rock our Kodesh the Holy Spirit they've come to express their love for Israel for the Jewish people oh they said okay and you can see their faces just relax and then when they heard the singing and saw this dance and they were just overwhelmed and when the women that was over they pressed right into these young people began to talk with them asking questions take them to their homes for tea for food and to the wee hours of the morning fantastic deep rich ministry of sharing and witnessing all around in Tel Aviv we ended up ourselves in the street one o'clock in the morning hand-in-hand with Israeli soldiers and young college-age kids one or two of them had even lost members of their own family in a recent massacre and attack from the sea from the I said to them look nice have you ever considered Israeli geography what kind of a God is it was left us so defenseless so open to the attack of our enemies from every direction even from the sea is that the same kind of a God who would not allow us to look for the arm of our own flesh for our defense or the natural barriers but look to him you know these guys have studied the Bible as their curriculum and they think that it's collection of myths and fables in history as if you never would you host a factor in the separate temple and he said oh God he said we have no might in ourselves but our eyes are set upon thee and they stick together with their wives and their children and the spirit of the Lord spoke into the congregation by the priest your heart to yell the battle is not mine but yours say for God against them tomorrow you know how we ended praying hand-in-hand Oh God if you're real and you're the same God that heard the prayer of that King and gave answer we ask that you would reveal yourself to us in this Yeshua Hamashiach of whom these Gentile students speak and sing it was a night of glory I didn't plan to share that part but you know there's an axiom that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach what would you say about a God who would say that the way to Israel salvation is through Germany and not through a face-to-face witness but through a deep ministry of supplication and groaning in the spirit for the lost sheep of the house of Israel and so God has led us in a succession of steps now the realization of this vision our first contact was with a wealthy elderly German in the city called Ruppertal who lived in Berlin through all the war years and had many Jewish friends and I said the dear brother what did you do in the early 1930s when you looked out your window in your apartment in Berlin and saw the Nazi youth pulling the the beards of the old men and breaking the store windows and letting the epithets and and beating up the Jewish kids what did you do then well he said I looked and I pulled the shade down and I walked away God had me to say to the same man early one morning only a few weeks ago God is giving you another opportunity to be an instrument in the salvation of these Jews don't pull the shade down the second time but he did we thought he was going to give us his house as a center for Jewish discipleship where God was going to be using Jews to affect a reconciliation in a divided body of Christ in Germany you think you have problems here they have animosities and splits and divisions that go back almost a century fierce contention rivalries coupled with German pride German arrogance German stiffness you can't believe what a knotted message it is only a sword can cut through that good enough and God is saying send a band of Jewish believers maybe they can compel an audience from Germans who will not give it to any anyone else even Billy Graham and maybe they'll be reconciled and they'll be in one spirit and one accord that my work can be affected that they might cry for the salvation of Israel so we had a conference at Columbia University and I thought well the Lord is going to show me who these disciples are today that will send and the first night they came to call for the fornicators gross sinners liars hypocrites and I'll tell you the aisles were full they came pouring out down the aisle down the front weeping sobbing choking spluttering and I saw that mess and I said oh is a is that the condition of the Jewish believe evidently this you kind of glory of God is not going to fall as quickly as we thought and so this year's conference which the Lord is leading us now to have is going to be on the shaping of Godly character and there's a place which God has given us first the 95 acre camp and now a 160 acre farm across the road from it not unusual to have 30 degree below zero winters where men are going to be called to be shaped for these end time ministries and to not be willing to tend the physical sheep and we have over 75 and they'll be more in sub-zero weather together with their brothers and sisters in these severe conditions how they shall they minister in Germany how then shall they react to the latent am I anti-semitism which is still there and the part of German Christians how shall they respond when they'll be unseen unrecognized unapplauded unheralded and have some way to win their way between the charismatic the Pentecostal Germans the evangelical the state church it's a very severe but God in his wisdom is putting together something that spans continents and there's a most beautiful unfolding I went to see that man on this most recent trip and God wake me three o'clock in the morning with his burning vision I was telling Paul today I prayed till 5 and try to get out of the house and found myself locked into the house I said Lord what's this and God said you're the spirit of life a picture of the spirit of life locked into Germany and a fearful insecure people who do not know me as they were I didn't get out of the house till six in the morning and finally had to be let out by the housewife the front door the foyer and out the front the gate 50 yards away and gave me a key to unlock the gate didn't even fit had a leap over the gate into the street and walked down the street looking for someone to inform me how to get downtown and had a conversation with a man waiting for bus was a Muslim a Turk a foreign worker and began to witness to him about Jesus as the one hope that can reconcile Arabs and Jews in the streets of Germany then another day later in bond Germany a home meeting ended up baptizing nine Germans in the bathtub of that apartment the next day to a German community near Frankfurt where we thought we were just going for a social visit the Lord began speaking one night over the coffee table by the spirit and these men pushed aside their cups and sauces and put aside every consideration and two days later God had done such a work by his spirit of an exchange of life of money of substance of concern that I was taking a rest night to describe the complexity of what God has done these men were never before laid eyes on me are paying the down payment to enable us to get into the farm in Minnesota and the house which we thought to sell in New Jersey that would finance the farm is now going to be retained for their use as their first outreach in the United States and extensive collaboration with the purest work of God I've seen on the face of the earth who have also the same burden they have Germans this is how I met them in Jerusalem where they've sent a team of German believers living very quietly and working very obscurely to affect a reconciliation among the divided body of Christ of Jewish believers in Jerusalem God sent Germans to Jerusalem to reconcile the Jews and he sends Jews to Germany to reconcile the German his ways of that then other ministry through those days I can begin to tell you a variety of places Germans Americans army chapels I came to one army chapel in the course of those days potluck Sunday night chicken balling kids not nose babies the whole works noise one stocking up one stocking down the chaplain was a careerist hail fellow well-met back slapper my heart just went clunk hopeless and I was gonna get a half hour on the program before they showed the film and in the midst of the fried chicken our whole works I went upstairs and I prayed for some of these German brothers we came down and they called on me God gave me Isaiah 6 about the holiness of God and in the head the moment that I began speaking a hush fell over that room not a single baby whimpered I think even the nose is dried up when I gave an invitation 13 people stood to their feet and among them was a Jewish GI who had never before heard the gospel who were saved in the moment of his standing not even a prayer for salvation absolutely done in staggered and then picking up stray men in ministry singular lonely men unrelated to others bringing them to a place where they can be related encouraging them in their ministries and enter Munich to do such a work with two American boys who were living there and struggling independent of each other things that can be shared and then on to Yugoslavia where I was invited by a Yugoslavian brother with whom I had gone to Leningrad a few years ago he'd heard me speaking in Germany on my last visit he said Artie said these Yugoslavian ministers need to hear this end time message I said well you think so arrange it he did and I came to this conference of the leading Pentecostal denomination Yugoslavia preceded by another speaker fine German brother not knowing their need couldn't speak their language and in four days God reconciled a denomination about to explode God did a work that when I was driven to the airport four days later they said God sent us the living word in the moment of our greatest crisis and need at the point when we threatened to explode God sent a prophet with the living word and I did not even know this situation and I would go to the meetings out of my hotel room not knowing ten minutes later from the room to the pulpit what to speak and after four days looking back I could see the continuity of God how he had laid the foundation line upon line precept upon precept stunning these men breaking weeping and wonderful deep rich work of God I could say without exaggeration in touching this key denomination at the moment of its greatest crisis the only instrument available to God in that nation he had touched the nation and I flew from Yugoslavia to Zurich to spend one night there with German brothers from that same fellowship who had an outreach there I needed to take a walk we took a walk through the streets of the city and all of a sudden I remembered this is where it began 11 years ago I hadn't been back to a zero in 11 years it was in the same street that I met that American girl who was on vacation who was willing to spend that time with me and whom I was querying why are you willing to be kind and she kept saying it's the love of God it's the love of God and finally at the end of my exasperation late that afternoon I asked her how do you know that God is and she gave me that answer that exploded my heart and arrested my life for God it happened in the streets of Zurich and the very next day when I left Zurich hitchhiking on my way this conflict broken Jewish bum intellectual frenzied trying to understand the perplexity of his life I was picked up by that Swiss man when we found out that I was Jewish took me to that coffee house and at the end of pouring out my soul to the stranger he asked me that one question Artie said you know what it is that the world needs and I had my arms folded over my chest with that fixed cynical expression on my face what he spoke that one line from which I've not yet recovered he said what the world needs is for men to wash one another's feet that was the first night I ever heard the gospel in 34 years it happened in Zurich and all of a sudden I had just come back from Yugoslavia and Germany trailing clouds of glory God touching nations God affecting this God spanning continents God working with end-time purposes for Israel and I was reminded where it all began 11 years ago when God picked up off the streets of that city a broken Hulk and led me step by step to a salvation in Jerusalem and about a decade later had fashioned an instrument by which he was affecting these things I want you to turn to the book of Acts and the 17th chapter I didn't tell you there's so many things I can't say and I'll forget now I won't have time while that conference was taking place in Yugoslavia in a city I had never before heard we were walking in the streets one day and we asked a woman for instructions and she was just about to get up on a trolley car and I said to my Yugoslavian brother stop her she's Jewish Oh Artie said how do you know she's Jewish I said brother don't argue stop her he stopped her just before she got on and indeed she was Jewish she walked us back to the hotel before she left us that day I had the names and addresses of two other Jews that Yugoslavian city whom we had gone to see and before we left that city in the course of those four days we had visited nine Jews a remnant of the previous Jewish community that existed before World War two and in fact went to this synagogue one afternoon now abandoned and have one of the most melancholy experiences of my life with the plaster hanging down bricks falling out no electric no illumination floor creaking we walked into this old building how do you having such an eerie impression and I came and I felt around that half darkness and walked up on the platform to the to the arc where the Torah's kept the scrolls of the law star of David now faded and I opened up the arc and there was nothing inside it's something of the same stun shock as a surgeon opening a chest and find no part in it and that night I came to the conference the scripture that God gave me standing on that creaking synagogue floor and your house shall be left to death and I said to these Yugoslavian ministers if you'll not be reconciled in Christ if you'll not lend yourself to the building of God's end time house and overcome your divisions and strives and the things which have divided you I shall come again and find that your house is desolate will be as as foreboding a sight as the synagogue which I've seen today and God will leave you with your plaster ceiling hanging bricks falling out your house shall be left to you that's what that's how God was using the circumstances of those days the fish for Jews to reconcile the body of Christ to seek out the lonely individual ministers who need to be comforted and strengthened and exhorted to go into army chapels and speak about the holiness of God and to do the variety of works which would please God before German audiences American audiences unsaved Jews from day to day following in the course of God and that dear children is really the substance of the thing that's on my heart tonight there's a beautiful illustration of this in the 17th chapter of Acts where a guy by the name of Paul caught up in the purposes of God we read in the 14th verse that his brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea here's a man in service to God no preconceived notion or plan if we had turned to the previous chapter of the 16th chapter who would who was successfully establishing the churches in Asia and was arrested by the Holy Spirit that forbade him not and redirected by a vision and was sent to Greece and now by a succession of steps into Macedonia into Berea and now on his way to Athens the brethren sent away Paul they conducted Paul and brought him unto Athens in the 15th verse and so we read that in the 16th verse while Paul waited for them at Athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry I hope this means to you what it means to me I can almost salivate as I read these scriptures you know why it's so undramatic it's so ordinary it has nothing to do with great bombast or voices ringing from heaven it has only to do with a man who is led by the spirit a man caught up in the purposes of God variable and instrument to speak to Jews to contend with with intellectuals to be in this city or that in Asia or Europe it matters not a man on course with God by God who says for me to live is Christ there's not a situation that he's going to find that will face him there's not a an untoward event or for which he is not prepared my last day in Switzerland at the very end of those 30 days the next to last day I was at youth with a mission in Lausanne some of the greatest ministry that they had ever recorded on their video and Peter Van Vorden you know I can you can say that without boasting Peter Van Vorden the son-in-law of the nephew of koi can boom came to him and as he was driving up the driveway the Lord said to him take art to see this Armenian millionaire and so he told me that after the service I had heard of this man I said why don't you call him see if he's available he called them only to find out that this man was definitely sick terrible case of flu can't see anyone as well and yet I didn't feel good about that as if Satan was stealing something God intended I said look whether how about if we just go and raise him up right out of the sick bed to know that God has sent us yeah he said and we drove out to this man's place right near La Brie and when we got there the man was sitting up in his drawing room that afternoon while in his sickness the thought came to him what am I doing in bed I ought to be out and he lifted himself up and the sickness broke we found him fully clothed alert and well on the phone trying to find us and make contact with us here we were knocking on his door at the same moment he said God has sent you he didn't know what for what I didn't either but we both knew that this was a divine encounter you don't have to know for what the same God who sends you will it's shortly explained and I gave that man a two-hour expression of the burden that God had given me because he has an enormous concern for Israel and I said except that you're a man of the spirit you're going to miss this there's nothing to do with bombast there's nothing to do with wonderful evangelical designs of winning the Jews it's an unseen invisible slow quiet work of God beneath the surface and he was a spiritual man and he saw it when I finished that he said Artie said I can't contain this will you write me a statement that I might study it and prayerfully consider what God will have me to do in this venture which I have since done the next day the day of my departure from Switzerland the same Peter Van Vorden comes again and takes me to see another millionaire this time a Jew these two men know each other and we went to see him in the suite of offices on our way to the airport to fly out what a suite of offices staggering what a man how impressive taking phone calls speaking French Hebrew English a South African Jew with a clip accent the picture of sophistication swab a self-assurance what do you want he said I didn't know but it became clear and he began speaking first telling me about all he's doing for Israel the thousands upon thousands that he invested that invest in that country the fundraising campaign he's a big macho big organizer his wife is a former inmate of Auschwitz and she's a big leader in the Zionist women's organizations his son had 40% burns on his body as a tank commander the Russian Yom Kippur war he's telling me all these things and I said excuse me just a second Norman here I'm telling this man multi-millionaire Norman I said Norman if you continue this way I'm going to weep whatever do you mean he said in his British accent I said you're the living epitome of our chronic Jewish era through the ages how do you like to begin that way what era he said do you mean I said your priorities are completely disordered if you think by your fundraising and your organizations and your wheeling and dealing striving that you're going to save Israel you are grossly mistaken I tell you God shall intensify our crises until we shall have no alternative but to look up to him that was the beginning of my statements two hours later and we had to leave because the plane was ready this man was absolutely pinned to the wall no one had ever dared speak to him as I spoke to him he knew though unsaved he was hearing from God with the authority of God that God was calling his life for commitment much deeper than anything that had to do with Israel bonds or fundraising and he also wanted a statement that he might read it and study it and consider what should be all crammed in to 130 day period something like what we're seeing in the life of Paul on course for God no plan brought to a place in Athens and while he was there in the 16th verse we read and his spirit was stirred in him dear children everything begins by the inception of God by his spirit in our have you ever had your spirit stirred within you I can't take the time now but I can give you illustration after illustration of this phenomenon it begins with a freaky feeling that no one else but you perceives everybody else seems to be having a ball starting to amens and hallelujahs but you're getting something something strange is ticking in your heart and sure before long God has got you up in a place where you're not scheduled to be and you're speaking words that cut like a sword and turning people off right and left while others are being brought from death to life it always begins with the inception of his spirit in our spirit how many times have you experienced that and turned it off or turned away from it and would not consider it he saw the city wholly given to idolatry praise God for men whose eyes are open and who perceives and whose heart can be wounded therefore disputed he in the synagogues with the Jews and with the devout persons in the market daily with them that met him notice beginning with the inception of something that winces in his spirit a step-by-step unfolding of God that is going to bring Paul to a key place where he could never have gone if he had sought by his own efforts to be there he saw the idolatry therefore he disputed in the synagogues doesn't that seem strange what have synagogues to do with idolatry except that it's grossest forms are practiced there haven't you noticed that in the Gentile equivalent of the Jewish synagogues I'll tell you that idolatry can be performed even in the name of Jesus if you have a spirit in which God can win and with the devout persons in the market daily with them that met with him I'll assure you it wasn't the soul that Paul encountered who in any way was haphazard or accidental everything was right on in the purposes of God that began with the inception of a man being wounded in his spirit by the spirit of God then certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics encountered him and some said what will this babbler say and others he seems to be set forth a strange God because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him unto Areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine wherever thou speakest is and so Paul was brought by other men to that one place which is the central place of discussion where the key men of Athens were to be found others brought him first it began by brethren bringing him to Athens then he was led to a synagogue then to a marketplace then by others to Mars Hill there's a wonderful unfolding in the purposes of God in which God employs the circumstances of other men and conditions to bring us to the place that pleases him have you ever experienced that it has not a cotton-picking thing to do with striving it has nothing to do with preconceived notions of how we shall evangelize or do this or to do that but only to be men and women led by the spirit of God in his time and place divorced altogether from any purpose of our own it's effortless and then we read in the 22nd verse then Paul stood in the of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for as I pass by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with the inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worshiped him declare I unto you I don't know as often as I've read that before you know what I never noticed Paul is insulting sophisticated intellectual Athenians him whom you ignorantly worshiped I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious that's almost like beginning a conversation with a celebrated personality and saying now Norman if you continue in this way I'm going to weep I perceive that in all things you are the living personification of our Jewish era through the centuries hey art that's no way to talk is that what you learned in the schools of evangelism is that how you witness to people I no more presume in any way I believe about the things that God will choose to speak or to do at any given moment I've seen him do such variable things I wasn't too long ago on an airplane and I'll tell you that I can fly 20 times and not speak to a passenger 19 times hey cats don't you know the world's done man shouldn't you be redeeming the time and shouldn't be witnessing with those that were next week no I've learned after 10 years that God is well able to open this mouth whenever it shall please him and every time that I have sought to open it hasn't availed much but when he opens it something is transacted for a time of return week so let me give you this illustration I'm taking work from Chicago just about to close the door one last passenger comes in huffing and puffing out of breath and plops right down alongside me one of most attractive black girls I've ever seen and the moment something began in my spirit by his spirit and before we had come to the place of taxing I was coming on like gangbusters but I was breaking every guide every rule in the evangelical guidebook I was getting on that girl's skin I was goading her I was teasing her she told me she was a graduate in psychology and I said oh I said what do you hope you think that that offers for a distraught mankind and she would tell me and I would take her answer I go crack what else you got to say crack just picking apart a puny little humanistic notions and she was a graduate student in the humanities were up 30,000 feet I thought have I ever got sucked out of this plane to my death she wouldn't even notice and just turn the next page of the Vogue magazine she said me first then my black people then mankind oh yeah I finally came to the point where I said what hope you think that the Bible offers for mankind oh she thought it was Uncle Tom religion and she began to rant and rave and God began through out of my mouth to prick this girl almost unmercifully and go at her and get under her skin and I sensed in my spirit that somewhere way back as a child she had been exposed to the word of life and over it has grown a hard sophisticated outward veneer and the only way that God was going to crunch that was not by polite speaking but by saying I perceive in all things that you're too ignorant and too superstitious are you willing to insult people if God shall put such words in your mouth if that's what it shall take for the rest of your life even though it violates what you think should be in the guidebook she came to such a place of exasperation she was trembling with indignation and my mouth was not stopped yet and finally she said if you'll not stop she said I'm going to call the stewardess and have your seat changed and all of a sudden the blood began to rush up to my head and I thought how's that going to look at a stewardess is going to come and change your seat Reverend Arthur can and I know what every passenger on the plane is going to think and you'll not have any opportunity to explain still willing to be God's fool in God's mouth and at that particular moment before I could think further there was a blonde woman on the other side of this black girl who had been overhearing our conversation with a cigarette out of the corner of her mouth lipstick over the lip line mascara peroxide blonde I mean typical bitty I think she even had a big fat cross hanging on her bosom and she looked over past this black girl and said yeah she said why don't you leave her alone what a beautiful illustration of what end-time ministry is going to be of those led by the spirit striving for the soul of one who has not even any notion of a God seeking to save her and unwilling even to receive the testimony having to suffer embarrassment and reproach and not being able to explain having to listen to the castigation and the bitter words of those who are going to say to us why don't you leave them alone are you willing children that is what it's going to come to in a very soon are you love the Jewish people do you I hope it's not in your schmaltzy sentimentality because that's going to go like a vapor as the crises of this age are going to unfold are you willing to be stand are you going to be willing to stand with Jewish people when reproach shall come upon them and harassment and growing anti-semitism even in this country or shall you like this German man pull down the shade and walk away he said Artie said if I didn't do that he said I would have shared their faith and so what are the alternatives Paul began by not mincing words with these Athenians when God brought him from Moscow God that made the world and all things therein seen that he is Lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples worship with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he give us to all life and breath and all things who is made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth and has determined the time before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us you realize what Paul is saying in one of two verses this is philosophy of the deepest kind this is a statement for the purpose of being that all of the philosophers and all of their striving and seeking and mental exertion have not been able to deduce he told them why it is that God established the earth how and why God gave bounds the purpose for all human beings to seek God that happy we might be found with him you know there's nothing unctuous about this I don't think he quoted yet a single scripture and in fact he was not going to he spoke philosophically to philosophers as I passed by I noticed the inscription to the unknown God praise God for a man who notices praise God for a man who was not unfamiliar with the cultures of people to whom God had brought him praise God that he did not trot out little tired religious cliches or four spiritual laws or five or forty praise God that it even seeks to bludgeon with scriptures praise God that God had the possession of a man in such a way that he could speak to other men even philosophically and yet end up speaking to them about the resurrection from the dead and I don't believe that when he came to that point he shifted gears and all of a sudden began to forget and become religious that his voice changed and he had a pontifical look on his face and all of a sudden he began to trill it was the same naturalness the same matter of factness now look guys this is the way it is look if you continue this way I'm going to leap I notice in all things that you're too ignorant you don't even know how to worship God listen this is the whole purpose for existing now the good the God who winked in times past in such practice exists is winking no longer but is calling all men everywhere to repent and so he goes on this delights my soul what is the word does this say low profile thing that I'm speaking or low something rather or not very zippy and bombastic and great wavings of arms and raising of the voice to great crescendos but I'll tell you we have here a picture of something very dear to the heart of God I have always rankled at those who are concerned about becoming spiritual all of this walking on eggshells and trilling with the voice and fixing to face to have the proper religious expression what a bunch of as a guy said to me whom God destroyed at a recent service on Easter Sunday at a big impressive denominational church where they came in all of their finery those who'd only come out once a year and the pastor before I was introduced spoke about taking up an offering to compensate for the purchase of the new choir robes and the reupholstering of the choir seats and it was religious from beginning to end there was a guy who had been brought to that service by his backslidden girlfriend hating every moment of it he told me later he said Artie said it was all BS he said the moment you open your mouth and out came such an explosive word about choir robes and finery and Easter expectations and religious posturing he said something began to thunder and hammer my heart and God attacked me and when I gave the invitation couldn't get out of a seat fast enough those sitting in their finery didn't budge an inch but a man was just destroyed and fell on his face before God and he kept crying for one o'clock we couldn't get him away it's really sad it's real it's really really sad I can't believe it what's happened there's really there's really God God found me God I want to just conclude by reading a little bit from a little booklet written by a Chinese writer this writer says many people cannot minister the Word of God apart from special revelation if at any given time they have no fresh revelation then their ministry comes to a standstill because revelation is the source of all their utterance I'm not against revelation it's the source of much of my utterance but not all of my utterance what came forth on that airplane to that black girl had nothing to do with divine inspiration that I heard my heart now art say this it was simply a mouth engaged by God out of the fullness of things that God has provided there coming forth to bring necessary life in the form of penetration that we need revelation if we got to have uttered ministries of fact but please bear this fact also in mind that revelation is not given us in unbroken continuity it was not so in the case of the 12 Apostles and it was not so even in the case of such a man as Paul I think Paul just got up at Mars Hill and right on a spot right in the moment which God brought him without premeditation without any opportunity he just drew from the collective experience of that day I noticed as I was walking here there's an inscription to the unknown God and the God of whom you are ignorant and it's not fashion and he just went on like that right in the vernacular and the idiom of the day out of his own personality out of the fullness of all that God had invested there in the years in which God had him to shape in a certain instance Paul said I have no commandment of the Lord yet despite that he continued to minister he dared to utter what he himself believed without having any fresh word from the Lord two Jewish boys who were related to us when a quandary about whether he should go to Israel some said yes some said no some said they were not mature no some said they need the experience they themselves were didn't didn't want to offend against God I say to go to Israel now is not a lock it could be a matter of life and death I was only passing by and I was stopped what do you think I said well I in that moment something went I can say go and I'll take full responsibility for you going I'll tell you children when God has the possession of you and there's a necessity to impart life in any given moment he can do it and it doesn't need to sound like thus saith the Lord coming out of a sound chamber he dared to utter what he himself believed without without having any fresh word from the Lord this is an amazing thing Paul distinctly says that he was expressing his own judgment he was not uttering what had been given him at that specific time but was simply giving his own opinion on the matter which was brought before him what a terrific thing to do this writer says he dared at times to express himself on spiritual matters without immediate revelation to speak under such circumstances would have been presumption on the part of others but there was no presumption on Paul's part this isn't some amateur this isn't some young guy trying his wings this isn't some neophyte thinking what shall I say in a certain situation this is the man of God who has been fashioned in obscurity and hiddenness in the beginnings of God and brokennesses and temptations and trials stuffed with the fullness of God a man who can say for me to live is Christ in him I move and live and have my being there was not a situation that would find him unprepared there was not a confrontation that that would stagger him there was nothing that would tax his own natural powers or boldness or skill or intelligence he had gone far beyond that for me to live is Christ he was not just the man of God have you noticed this the man an art cat 11 years ago in the streets of Zurich a bum broken nothing the revelation of God for the face of Gentiles and the salvation of God in Jerusalem and in the course of the years that follow God shaping a Godly man and then a man of God and maybe the final stage as with a Paul and with an Elijah as with Jesus the God man you can't tell where Elijah leaves off and God begins you can't tell where Paul leaves off and Jesus begins is God trying to bring us to the place where we can say as the Lord my God liveth before whom I stand it shall not rain nor do but according to my word and the elements are arrested that God has so worked his life into a man that his word is God's word the secret is that over the years there have been a ceaseless increase of the grace of God in his life in Paul we meet a man oh hallelujah it takes God to be a man God hasn't called us to be a feet spiritual beings drilling with our voices and walking on eggshells but a certain fullness of life in the design which God intended a life that God has dealt with which he has poured in his grace over the course of years and trials and experiences and so written his life into the life of that man that at any given moment despite the need the situation Jews Gentiles Germans chapel conventions conferences Yugoslavia millionaires whatever the need he is able to draw forth out of the grace that he has invested a life-giving answer for the moon and Paul we need a man the most precious thing here is that though Paul was not consciously speaking the word of God he was all the while under the control of the Holy Spirit and was spontaneously expressing the mind of God he winced in the spirit when he saw the idolatry in the city a wealthy Christian can out of the abundance of grace in his life speak the mind of God without the overwhelming consciousness of being God's mouthpiece and I'll tell you every time it'll come out with a Brooklyn accent a North Carolina accent or whatever is the distinctive manner of speaking of the vessel through which the life of God is being poured now tell you what children when I came to the end of that 30 days or any 30 days or any trip or any challenge or any experience which God has left me you want to know what something that's happening now I'm as fresh on the last day as I am on the first none of that chronic exhaustion that used to characterize me in times past you know what I'm learning it's the father who'd do it hallelujah I remember going from one meeting to another tired trying to think what am I gonna speak I Lord I apologize I haven't had time to pray I said Lord and the Lord said I didn't expect you to pray how do you like that I said what he said I have appointed others for that task you have enough to bring your body and your face and that night I mentioned that in the meeting and a woman began she winced and cried out at that particular moment when I mentioned that and came to me weeping after the service to save art only a few weeks ago God whispered your name to me in my sleep and I didn't heed it and rolled over and when you mentioned that he pricked me that I'm one of those called to pray for you oh dear children no striving no exertion no necessity to be spiritual to be clever to be only in the possession of God in his place and his time for his purposes it has nothing to do with our thinking our prearrangement our plans what we would think would be the clever way to evangelize Jews who would ever conceived of Germany how shall that be obtained what are we gonna do in Minnesota how shall the community be established by what wisdom what principles how shall the funds be found what shall we do when we get there the same question really essentially I had to answer a few years ago when I went to my first place of ministry in Kansas City as a missionary to the Jews Lord what do I do after we move in I've had a crash program a year's kind of training I'm wet behind you I don't know what which end is that you know what I did I took the diapers to the laundromat and at the laundromat I asked a woman how to operate the machine and she told me and I found out she's Jewish what are you doing in Kansas City she said mm-hmm the time she left she had a list of scriptures so long and that was the beginning of our ministry in Kansas City just take the diapers to the laundromat in the course of time that came to pass when he was faced with a need he could immediately speak the word that met the need here we see the lofty heights to which under the new covenant the grace of God can bring a man here is a human life that has been wrought upon by God over the years God has been ceaselessly molding this life and purifying it till at length something has been wrought into the man's very Constitution you know how something is wrought over an anvil with the pounding of a hammer in a red hot oven this is wealth and this is the result of unremitting divine activity in a human life over years of time that's the burden children that I had to share with you tonight the challenge to confront to baptize in bath tubs to comfort believers to encourage to establish to exhort to search out you to testify to give the prophetic word to save a denomination to weep to groan come to Jewish community centers and seek out and fish for the Jews stand in the middle of the graveyards and weep over the two thousand stones in the valley of dry bones do all those things in all the countries and see the purposes of God affected and to be as much at rest on the last day is worth the first it's the fatherhood with the works you know that there's a rest which God has prepared for the people of God all hallelujah I pray that something will be worked in your spiritual appetite to be fashioned to be such a one as this something tempered on anvil heavy poundings with hammers hot burning ovens that God might infuse and build and shape substance of his life and grace into you at any moment you're fully prepared if you've been struggling to be spiritual striving to be spiritual conscientious of how you should witness and what you should do the answer children is to allow yourself to be formed at the hand of God and so to infuse his life in you it's not going to be done in a day it will be done in obscurity and hiddenness that when he is finished with the process it will be hard to say where you end and where he begins it's all one you'll be commanding the elements and they shall obey you you bow your heads with me
