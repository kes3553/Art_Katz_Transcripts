Gleanings from Psalm 37 1 of 2 - Art Katz

It's full of instruction, and it has certain premises, certain things that are assumed or understood, and often they are explicitly spoken or referred to, so that when the smoke clears and you have been a student of the Psalms, you realize that you have been introduced to a certain mindset, a perception of reality, a, what's the German word for that, a Weltanschauung, a worldview, and leave it to the Germans to invent the word, but of course they have the mentality.

We would never have come up in our English or American speech because you don't think in terms of a worldview.

We don't have an overarching perspective that is all-inclusive and has a certain logic, a divine logic, but they do. The psalmist has it, and in fact as you scrutinize the Psalms and see your present situation, it throws you into an inevitable conflict as to what in fact is reality.

Is the psalmist all-weak? Is he simplistic? Does he reduce everything to the wicked and to the righteous, and good and evil, curse and blessing? Is that life?

I mean life is much more complex than that, that it could be reduced to such simple categories, and they are always in opposition. The psalmist has a view of reality that is dualistic, D-U-A-L, it always reduces itself in the last analysis to two things, the righteous and the wicked, blessing or curse.

God or the enemy, light or darkness. And that's not a mentality that is appropriate in our generation.

We are relativistic, we see many paths to truth, there are always nuances and shades of meaning and shades of gray, but the psalmist has a clear and simple view.

The question is this, is it because he's a simpleton or is it because his view is God's view? That's the critical question.

If the view of the psalmist is God's view, we're in trouble. We are the ones who need profoundly to be corrected and adjusted. So that's my position, I see the psalmist's view as being God's, foundational, and we need to be brought back to it. And you'll see that there's a disjuncture, a tension of conflict between modern views, and seeing modern mentalities and that of the psalmist. And of course this psalm is particularly David's, this is a psalm of David, God's beloved.

So that gives it a certain ring, aura, or authority that we shouldn't miss.

Maybe he's beloved because he sees like this, and we will and are also as we come into this view and into this perspective.

So I'm reading from my study Bible, New Revised Standard Version, pipe in where your version is a little different and perhaps even keener. I love the King James, but let me read from mine.

Do not fret because of the wicked, do not be envious of wrongdoers, for they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb. So we just comment as we go rather than, you know, why does the psalmist begin with an injunction like this, do not fret. Fretfulness is a state of unbelief. To fret, to be anxious, to vomit the mouth, to be irritated, to be resentful is an indication of an absence of faith. It's being chafed because you don't see God in that situation and there's something that strikes your heart and impatience or as something being foundationally unjust. Because we will learn from this psalm and it's repeated many times over for the Psalms that the unrighteous seem to prosper. In this life, they're having a blast, they're not occupied with the things that weigh upon us, they're sailing through life glibly, blithely, everything goes their way.

They seem to have it all together.

So there's every reason to fret, not only because here we are thinking to be serious about God and his purposes and we're catching it and we will catch it all the more as we come more deeply into the last days while they seem to be prospering all the more. So what we're fretting about is not only the inequity of that, we should be the ones prospering and being blessed and they who are indifferent to God and are hostile to God and are even a threat to God's people are having a blast.

So the question is where is God?

We're really vexed, not just because of the painful contradiction, but because it raises a painful question, where is the God who is just, who is righteous, who honors the righteous and gives to the righteous blessing and censures and rebukes the unrighteous? This is what really disturbs us and God allows us to be disturbed. He allows us to choose whether we will be vexed or we will have such an understanding of God's ultimate righteousness that doesn't have to come forth right now. He could delay it for purposes of his own, that we can be at peace even in the contradiction of things that offend our sense of God. And that is faith, because we have to reckon in that there's an eternity to come. It's not all going to take place in our lifetime and if we have not sufficiently considered eternity, we will be vexed. So David begins with don't be vexed, it's not a suggestion, it's almost a command. Because of the wicked, do not be envious of wrongdoers who seem to be prospering in the midst of their wrongdoing, for they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb. We're going to see in this song words like soon or in Psalm 102 or other places or in the scriptures, what does it say, for a moment I turn my face from you.

A moment? Two thousand years is a moment? Yeah, in God's sight.

But in our sight it seems grievously long, how long we have to wait. The problem is not God's but ours, which is to say our human impatience is predicated on the fact that we reflect a now generation that has to have it now. The mark of the true Davidic saint is the ability to postpone gratification. The mark of the carnal believer is the one who needs to be immediately gratified now. And one of the great questions through the faith is waiting upon the Lord. Waiting is the priestly disposition and demeanor. It does not mean twiddling your thumbs, it means a patient trust that though God's answer seems long in coming, yet will you wait for it, which is to say you'll not succumb to an itch yourself to provide your answer. Your trust is complete, you've thrown yourself upon God, and in fact if he doesn't come through you'd rather die waiting than to succeed by doing it. Not a victim of circumstance, and circumstances don't call the shots, God does, and your trust and your faith in him. They that wait upon the Lord is a mouthful, and we're not finished talking about it. This is more than passive resignation. As an active engagement and absolute trust, God will come through, however long it takes, and if there's reasons for the delay, we don't have to be instructed. He's not under obligation to explain to us why he's late, or why he's slow, or why the answer has not yet come. We know that God is God, we know that he's sovereign, we know that he does all things well, that he's perfect in all his ways, and if there's a seeming delay from the human side, from our impatient side, something is being wrought in the heavenlies or in the earth that we cannot see, that is somehow congruent with all those purposes, and he cannot therefore answer our need in the moment that would gratify us.

I was once on a plane flying overseas reading a time, a Newsweek magazine, about economics.

Some of you may have heard me make this remark, it's worth repeating, and the author says, a secular man, he says, we've come to such a pitch, in such a place and time, that anything that happens anywhere affects everything everywhere.

I said, wow, what to God, a saint had said that.

A secular man is seeing that in the secular world, how much more should we? That anything that happens anywhere affects everything everywhere, and there's the Lord over the whole of his massive enterprise, coordinating and moving things for the consummation of the end, so he cannot gratify us in the moment that we think the answer should come, because what comes to us has got to be co-ordinate with what he's doing elsewhere, and we can't see that doing, so we have to trust for it. Waiting is the name of the game, it's the mark of the saint, it's a priestly disposition, and impatience being chafed, anxiety, fear are statements of unbelief, lack of trust that God is God. So they will soon fade away like the grass, how soon, it will not be tomorrow, it may not be till eternity, so we need to come into God's scene, what is soon for him. For a little while, I have turned my face from you, a little while, my God it seems like forever, well you need to adjust your seeing with mine, because the day in the sight of the Lord is as a thousand years. Trust in the Lord and do good.

This is James, if you have not works, where is your faith?

Trust is not some kind of abstract disposition, it must eventuate in works, there must be consequence, there must be a doing that issues from the faith, that is not an alternative to faith. The kind of works that God despises are those things that are engineered or summoned out of our humanity as an alternative to trust, that is despicable, but the works that issue from faith, that is sublime. And in fact when he comes, he shall bring with him his rewards and give to each man according to his works. God forbid that in that day we should merit no reward, because we thought that works were contrary to faith and we were just waiting, we didn't do anything, I can't believe that's such a life, that the knees are so great of the last days, they cry at you, it's not for us to pick and choose to which of them we will respond, but certainly God has not called us to passivity, but to participation, and in fact that very participation is the preparation for our eternal living and reigning with him, so it's a remarkably active life, but it's not self generated, nor is it a bomb or a stop for our souls as an alternative to trust or an alternative to faith, it's the works that issues from faith. Look at the order, trust in the Lord and do good. I bet when David wrote that he wasn't saying, how shall I say this so that the saints of every generation will know that faith precede works, he didn't think like that, I don't know that he was even thinking, he just was just spontaneously bearing his heart, but the great principle of God was wrought in his heart, and he could not have expressed it in any other way than he did. Trust in the Lord and do good, I mean after man says something like that he should retire, you're not going to beat that you know. So you will live in the land and enjoy security, who has another expression for that, that sounds like my reformed addition here, so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed, oh isn't that beautiful, of course dwell on the land, does that literally mean Israel or Palestine? I'm asking, I would say yes, but that's not the full statement, and it's a critical question, whether present Israel can continue to be occupied by those who are unrighteous, that righteousness is the qualification for residency, not some invoking God said that this was all Yes, if you live in it under covenant conditions, with a hot attitude and a conduct that's God honoring, if not you'll be expelled from the land, and so that land yes, but there's that land also in a kind of spiritual sense, you'll dwell in the place of God. The first is a statement that calls us to a certain condition, and then the second statement is the result of our having obtained it, it's full of instruction, we're going to see here the kinds of things that are so different from the modern mentality, maybe I'll just link to it right now, about your children, look at verse 26, here's David speaking, I have been young and now I am old, so this is evidently David in the latter stages of his life, having a long experience of being groomed in the way of God, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken, or their children begging bread, they are ever, who's the day, the righteous, are ever giving liberally and lending, they are magnanimous, their generosity, it's in what in them, it's not some self-conscious obligation, they spill out and they spill over, and their children become a blessing, that's the point I wanted to make, it's as if it's a reward for being generous, how do you couple these things together, what has got to do with children, is it because they see your example that they're going to grow up in the right way, perhaps, but that's not implied or stated, it's as if there's a divine principle here, that if you want your children to become a blessing, it's not going to be by taking them by the ear or grounding them in their faith, I'm not disparaging that, but the remarkable thing is, they're going to be a reflection of your generosity, that your generosity of soul, your ability to give the largest, this magnanimity that overflows, the consequence, divinely speaking, is God will bless your children, show me that, how is that cause and effect, where can we see that this relates to that, we can't, God simply says so, how about that, what a remarkable thing, and it completely blows our minds, I'll tell you what, is there a generation that needs more to know, what will it take for our children to be blessed, to become a blessing rather than a threat, we're raising up a generation of monsters, capable of murder and mayhem without batting an eyelash, how can we avert and save them from the sweep and the tenor and the terrible atmosphere of this generation that is calculated to make them murderous, well by being generous, that's how, according to the song, of course if this is just David daydreaming, we can ignore it, but if it's David expressing a divine principle, we had better heed it, so what am I saying, the Psalms introduce us into a perception of reality, of cause and effect, that is altogether different than what the world knows, I would say that if you would follow this, the world would see you not only as strange, but disturbed and maybe even dangerous, you're no longer sane, you're not playing by the rules, you're hearing another drummer and you're marching by another beat, well it's a new question of who's really sane or insane, but we may not be far from the time that if they see parents acting like this and trusting like this, their children might be taken from them as being irresponsible parents who are not doing it according to the world's program, so that even raising children in the last days is a remarkable taxation on faith, for example the Psalms and the Proverbs, spare not the rod, the rod will not die, well if you do that in Sweden, if you inflict the rod, you'll find yourself in prison, that's called abuse and these children have rights, even in this country now I believe, to divorce themselves from their own parents legally, choose not to be the children of these parents, so we're coming to a final showdown over the issue of children and how they're to be raised and whether we're going to follow the injunctions of God or that of man, it's a remarkable, to raise children in the last days is a remarkable demand on faith, so the children are really the product of our faithfulness toward God, more than anything else that is the issue, the children are the statement of our relationship and attitude toward God, I'm trying to remember an episode that came when I was praying for somebody in a hospital and they complained that their kids are loudmouth, vulgar, obscene, full of cursings and all sorts of things of that kind that really disturbed them and the Lord had me say something like, you would do well to regard that as some symptom and statement of your own failure, probably your own walk with God is a kind of obscene disrespect, these children are visibly and audibly expressing in disrespectful terms what you in fact are doing spiritually before God but don't recognize it because you're not employing language of that kind but in substance what they are exhibiting is what you are in fact performing before God and the way that God brings it to your attention is by showing it to you and your children, that's another way of perceiving reality, we need to put on another set of glasses, we need to bring ourselves into an alignment with divine perspectives which are altogether different and other than that by which the world understands and it's the question ultimately of what is real, what is reality? So back to verse four, take the light in the Lord, he will give you the desires of your heart, hear again a statement or an injunction, a call and then a promise of a certain result that is altogether different from cause and effect in the world, we don't see the connection but it's a divine connection, delight yourself in the Lord, he will give you the desires of your heart because you can be assured that if you delight yourself in the Lord your desires will be very much in keeping with his own, it's not going to be for a car that's a block long and has 16 cylinders that won't even interest you, what will be the desire of your heart will be the desire of his heart because you delight yourself in the Lord, but hey how do you come to that place to delight yourself in the Lord, he's invisible, what are you going to delight and you know what we need to notice, we should be keen observers of life as it has lived in our generation, delight itself is a very rare phenomenon in the world, well known among the people children of God, would you have a delight, what is delight, just to dwell on that word delight, I would say that sainthood is proportionate to our capacity for delight and that our capacity for delight is proportionate to our willingness for suffering, that joy is relative to sorrow and that if we are immune and don't want to experience painful emotions and just want to walk a kind of a middle course we will rob ourselves of joy and delight because we are not willing for the other end of the spectrum, sorrow, pain, suffering, disappointment, we've got to take the chances, you know the Christian life is vulnerable and what is community, but the willingness to be vulnerable to disappointment, to all of the kinds of shocks and jaws and things that take place when God's people are together long enough and intensively enough to reveal and to express those things that will be painful before they're joyous, you know that follow that, that I knew when I left that 17-room house in New Jersey with the two volvos and nine bedrooms and five baths that this was not going to be a picnic, I wasn't concerned about the alteration of the material condition of life because I can only sleep in one bedroom at a time and use one bathroom at a time, but I knew that I was opening the door for humiliation, that I would be found out the truth of my life, my marriage, my family, it would be out, it would be hanging out there and yes, so you have to bear that, but I would not be doing God's service and justice if I said it was only humiliation, only frustration, only discipline, only pain, they were corresponding joys, unspeakable, moments of God where you didn't leave the room, you floated out of the room, dealings and revelations, breakthroughs and insights and joy in the Lord, that's proportionate, so what distinguishes the Saints from the Earthlings? The Earthlings want to play it safe, they don't want to make themselves vulnerable for pain, but they shut out at the same time any prospect of joy and therefore they've got to hit the bottle, they've got to have a chemical substitute for the joy that would have been theirs in the Lord, because we're made for joy, we're made for living life in the full, we're not made for a stunted humanity, but to be large in God, Paul was a full-orged man in mind and body and soul and spirit, he wasn't some narrow performer, some religionist serving some narrow God, he was larger than life and so what all God's people could be if they're willing for the whole spectrum of both suffering and joy. Maybe the art of delight is not the spectacular things but the mundane and the everyday things that are always with us, that we would have passed by without observation or appreciation, to find delight in the ordinary and the Saints, to find your delight in the Saints of God is our relationship with God, I praise God for that, he doesn't allow us an exalted, phony, super spiritual, ethereal relationship with him, independent of our relationship with his people, the two things are so coordinate, so I would say that I would be suspicious of ethereal delight at a spiritual level where there's not a corresponding delight at the earthly level with God's people as they in fact are in their present condition, in the process of sanctification and not yet arrived and still to find the light in them, in fact the day will come when we'll have no other source of delight, the plug the plug will be pulled on the amenities of civilization and we're not going to be running to the movies or not that we do now or any other external enjoyment, we'll be locked in with the Saints and I remember from the first months of our experience here 25 years ago everybody wanted to go into town and we were poor, we couldn't afford these trips, it's a 60 mile round trip, that's at least two or more gallons of gas and we didn't have that many vehicles and most of them were broken down, we had a plot for one or two free trips a week that had to do with purchase and things like that but people wanted to go into town, I said what for, my kids wanted to go into town, they wanted to go to the mall, I said well what do you need, nothing really, what do you want to buy, nothing, why do you want to go, we want to see the merchandise, we need to see our eyes are voluptuous, we need, we need, we're bored at looking at the same faces all the time, we want to get out, you know, we're confined and we see the same people every day, well you may see them but do you see them, you know, are they so one-dimensional that after you've seen them for a few days you've exhausted the subject, you know, or is there richness in God's people, don't they have a history in God, aren't they variable, can you find two of the same, there's no two fingerprints the same as snowflakes, what then about those that are made in God's image that he has formed from their mother's wounds, they're so variable, I can't help but think of Ingrid wanting to call the ambulance when we were in Israel, what's that support on the Red Sea, Eilat, and they have a maritime museum and you can go down a spiral staircase and you're looking into great glass windows of the sea, you're at the bottom of the sea at Eilat and you can see the flora and the fauna, well I saw fish and forms of life of such a kind, some fish were chartreuse, some were shocking pink, some were dots, some had zigzags, I never saw such a variety of design that had nothing to do with their environment, it did not protect them where they would be kind of camouflaged, it made them all the more conspicuous, which is to say that God who created them was just having a bash, just a ball, it was just going well, he's pulling out the stops, he's just showing the variety of his power to create in his originality, gasping and choking and spluttering, and they had it caught in your way in a straight jacket.

We've never heard that one.

Ask Inger, she always talks about it, I actually went berserk when I saw God pull out the stops because I'd grown up in this revolutionary thing that they take on their forms, they're comedians, they change their colors to protect, yeah there's that, but there's God who just wanted to show that I can create without anything to do with the environment that it inhabits, just to show off my creative power.

Look at this, can you find two fish the same?

Shades of color and shocking colors, astonishing, like they're illuminated, plugged in and dots and zigzags and design, it was staggering. How can we ever say that we're bored with the saints, whether we have to get out, we see the same people, our problem is we don't see. So I think somewhere, is it in the Psalms or the Proverbs, we're encouraged to draw out the heart of another, that probably we're bored because we lack the facility to draw out the richness that's in God's saints and we're suffering from a malnutrition in the church, though the irony is that we could feast in what is already there in the saints, but we lack the facility to draw out the nourishment that's there. So what a contradiction that God has already given us such wealth and we're impoverished and suffering from malnutrition and if we need a pastor we have to import him from somewhere. I never liked that, that they find a replacement, they have to put out a search and get some guy from and rather than out of the organic body itself, which is God's way. So may we delight ourselves in the Lord, which is to say delight ourselves in God's people, delight ourselves in God's nature, delight ourselves in God's word and his purpose in the Psalms, in the Psalmist, in David. Listen, we've got a family here, David the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the prophets of old and the apostles and all of the giants of the faith and the great literature that has issued from them beyond the scripture itself. What an inheritance, what a past, what a future, what a destiny and you're bored and listen and you've got to get out to a shopping mall to see the merchandise.

And by the way they know how to package the merchandise. Supermarkets today. Why do they stack it in such abundance?

Because there's a psychological principle that when you see something in such multiplication and visible abundance it moves upon you to have a piece of that and they know how these manufacturers and those who produce Wheaties and corn pops vie for shelf space, that there's a great struggle and an internal tension and dynamic about who's going to have this shelf space because that's at the eye level. And don't you know that they employ people who have university degrees in design and color and sound and every kind of thing for for movement.

There never was a generation like this where every demonic.

The demonic equivalent of what will engage the eye, engage the senses that's voluptuous, colorful and will bring you into it in order to buy. And in contrast to that we have the simplicity of the church in its ordinary condition in God's makeshift slapdash uh motley band of saints that there are not many what does it say not many how many noble noble not many yeah yeah we're out of the bottom of the barrel with we're off the donkey so they let the light themselves in the Lord what a phrase what a statement wow what's the promise they'll receive the desires of their hearts and i'm sure that those desires are uniquely different from those who do not delight themselves in the world probably a reversal of the kind of desire that men would have in the world so commit your way to the Lord trust in him and he will act it's a promise to believe that his it's a promise to believe that his action may be slow in coming and when it comes it may be different from what you expected he will act he will make your vindication shine like the light though you may have to for a long season wallow in and live in unjust accusations and misrepresentation and all the other kinds of things he's not God's not in the business of alleviating our distress instantly in fact distress has salutary benefit to live with distress with demeaned reputation or where your vindication does not come and you have to live it out with your face sticking out for example call the cult or a sec because we're living in the woods here people believe that we've been here 25 years and if you will pick someone off the street of cast lake or look what and ask them what they think they would say this is a cult assert well that's not a happy accusation and it's the opposite of the truth this is as yeah i mean i mean how do i say this as much the reality of the church as can be found in this locality and yet to the eyes of people in certain conditions it called it a sec and God's not vindicating you even a woman who did an article on us from the park rapids newspaper and meant well yet when the way the article came out we did not come up smelling like a rose she said those who follow art as if oh yeah what's this guy jones gave you the appearance of some cultic thing a bunch of mindless brainwashed glassy eyed people following this charismatic figure who knows where that's the way she saw that's the way she expressed it and i didn't call her back to say we want equal space we want vindication we want to be set forth as we are not as you have this sort of representative you just have to live with that there's suffering there's something beneficial in the suffering of something that is not quickly vindicated it's something like the prophet having to hold his burden God giving it to him years in advance of any possibility of fulfillment but why give it to him before the time because he has to hold it and in the holding of it and keeping quiet about it just the holding something is going on in the interior man as a kind of discipline that affects the man that when the time for the release of the burden comes it'll come forth in a much more pure and profound way than if you had blurted it out immediately there's some benefit in holding and there's some probably some benefit in being unjustly accused and not being quickly vindicated and living with injustice or misrepresentation and bearing it and david and when he cut off the corner of soul's role he said let God vindicate me let him judge between us i'm not going to make a case for myself so there was david in a an explicit moment when his own life was at stake acting to this principle but just interesting that this morning i think before i finished my first cup of coffee i only had two apologies but the result when God does it he will make your vindication shine like a light when he vindicates it's not just that you will be alleviated of your personal distress but that he will be glorified in that alleviation because you're probably suffering it on his account and the justice of your cause like the moon day let God do it because then it really comes forth redemptively and gloriously be still before the lord and wait patiently for him so this waiting be still be still to know that i am God you know that i can also out of the sun how much of our failure to know God is our failure to be still because the promise of being still is the obtaining of the knowledge of God and as i mentioned that would not be ours if we were not obedient to the command to be still that the key to the knowledge is not our active intellectual pursuit but obedience to the word be still and know the knowing is the consequence of being still but being still is no small requirement particularly for us who have been in the world or energetic men or dynamic or to be still not just externally but inwardly you know there's a way in which you can maybe sit on your hands but your heart is palpitating your mind is racing your thoughts are way out in left field that's nothing still being still is the whole of body soul mind and spirit coming to a place of rest because it's a place of confidence in God that can wait and then that is the knowledge of God be still and know there's much at stake and yet it is contrary to the whole ethos ethos the whole mind of our present civilization that is frenetic active anxious always on the go always finding some more bizarre more loud picturesque kind of film a thing of program to be still in our generation would really be a spiritual attainment this is a generation that can't do its homework without the radio on but without their earphones on without a boombox how many times you're riding the street that some guys got his radio in the car he has some special equipment you know you don't just hear the noise issue out of his car you feel the vibration that sound has become a sensual experience in our generation so that quiet is the very antithesis of all of this demonic emphasis on noise now to fight to be quiet in the midst of that like the day that in cairo egypt they went up to see the sisters of mary vasilya schwenk's fellowship the marian schwestern denote this is the sisters of mary they're not catholic it's a protestant women's fellowship in germany vasilya schwenk is one of God's 20th century oracles and when you go to domstadt the headquarters as i did the first time you're on holy ground felt palpable holy ground and the legend that i've heard is that when david wilkerson visited there for the first time by the end of his visit he threw himself on the compost heap wow he was so stricken about the holiness of God that was sensed and felt in that place that he threw himself on the on the compost heap what is it what what kind of an atmosphere must it be that so felt palpable so holy if you read the history of that place these women built those buildings themselves out of the rubble and bricks over the destroyed domstadt of world war two and the one episode talks about the trolley falling off the tracks that were bringing the bricks to the building site and they they stopped and they prayed and the lord showed them that there was an unspoken resentment between two sisters and these two sisters were convicted and worked it out and prayed and forgave them the thing never fell off the tracks again everything they did was couched in the deepest spiritual terms everything practical and physical was really ultimately spiritual so that when it was finished and they lived in that spirit it was holy holy holy well it's one thing to do that in germany because pietistic movements are part of the history of protestantism in germany we don't have this in america an order of women who are celibate and wear wedding bands because they're married to the lord it's unknown in germany it's not unknown so i thought well this is they have an advantage in their history and their culture but then the lord called them to this band and to go out from from germany and into different parts of the world so i went to visit them in cairo you know what cairo is like you can't cross the street without getting hit by a camel or a car if there are three or four lanes there are seven or eight cars vying for it they don't drive by sight they drive by sensors by hearing the sound of the horns that are continually being sounded you know if you're in it's an unbelievable congestion unbelievable stink unbelievable pollution it's the noisiest filthiest city in the world 14 million people ragged compressed into that place i said oh let me see the sisters and marry here you know one thing to perform this in germany so i remember going up the flight of steps they had like an apartment for themselves and i knocked on the door expecting to see them haggard and disordered and and and responding to the congestion and the intensity and noise of that environment and the door opened then out came the same heavenliness that i had been affected by in germany it wasn't germany the issue was not where they were the issue was what they were in God they brought heaven with them even to cairo so be still is one thing in an environment like this but how about when it will be charged with tension and life and death questions and noise and contention and clamor can we be still then and be quiet then it's an art but we need to cultivate it nurture it and we're encouraged to it in the psalms we're enjoying be still before the lord now don't miss that plot be still before the lord because if you're still before the lord what is there externally in the world or in man that can rob you of that quiet wait patiently for him do not fret over those who prosper in their way over those who carry out evil devices refrain from anger and forsake wrath do not fret what is about the third or fourth time now that that injunction has come right not fear not fret not it leads only to evil for the wicked shall be cut off but those who wait for the lord shall inherit the land here's a whole what should i say framework of understanding of reality this is as fundamental as you can get in what touches the ground where the rubber hits the road those who are pursuing evil and seeming to prosper at it who are wicked and the righteous who are seeming to be denied they have to wait for their gratification for their realization and this is somehow the formative way in which the psalmist perceives the whole of reality itself the wicked shall be cut off does it say when the issue is God it's not that men are just prospering who are wicked it's where is the God who allows them the issue is God it's not that men are just prospering who are wicked it's where is the God who allows them to prosper and is this the God in whom we can believe or maybe God himself is a fiction and a myth and we have been sucked into some understanding that that reality does not support where is this God very slow to deliver the goods and to allow us to languish in the condition of this tension as if he is not God the only way that you can do that without fretting is to have a sublime confidence that God is God even when he's not delivering the goods and that he's not under obligation to deliver the goods even in your lifetime that these all these died the great heroes of this of the faith in hebrews chapter 10 is it 11 all these died not having received the promise but having received a good report none of them saw the realization of that for which they lived the life of faith and sacrifice right till the day of their death but not one of them ever was diminished in faithfulness and performing the things which they were called they didn't have to they didn't have to have the immediate reward in order to be faithful they could believe for it after this is faith this this this is sacred and they are the pattern that's why they've given us in in hebrews 11 as the it's not that some of them died without having to work all these died not having received the reward all without exception as if to say the reward is not to be expected in this life but faithfulness is obedience is service and servanthood is without the reward the reward will come after the reward will come later how do you know because God says so because he's faithful because he will vindicate his saints and the after is much longer and much more glorious than the present this is a transient and passing thing it's eternity that's the real subject for which this lifetime is only preparation cats you're really mad now you sound like someone out of the middle ages who had this narrow view that this life was a veil of tears and trial all for the eternity to come pie in the sky when you die come on guy wake up get with it it's this life is now or nothing that's why we get divorced and remarried not once but twice or three times because we have a right because we want to be gratified and after all we're young yet and still good looking and it was an unhappy experience but why be saddled with that try try again it's this life we've got to get our satisfaction in this life and that has unhappily come into and corrupted or is corrupting the church not over the issue of marriage but many issues because we want our satisfaction and a reward now a saint is one who can postpone his gratification till after and in no way diminishes his obedience or his service he does not need the reward of gratification now in order to be obedient he's utterly confident that the lord will yes at some future time bring it beyond any ability has even anything conceive of it totally different from the world the world wants workers and the world wants performance it's reward is right now and it'll even tell you what you will get if you'll perform but the children of the kingdom marched by another people all these died not having received the reward but were convinced of it so the wicked shall be cut off but those who wait for the lord shall inherit the land and all that that phrase implies yet a little while and the wicked will be no more what do you mean a little while imagine living in the hypnotic time when when one day was like an eternity and and jews were being slaughtered like they was going out of style and nations were being overturned and civilization being brought down around our ears in God says in a little while well his little while and our little while are two different things yet a little while and the wicked will be no more it seems like a forever and the wicked are destructive see the dualism of the psalmist it's the wicked and the righteous there's no other category there's cursing or blessing there's righteousness or evil it's a dualistic view of reality that modern people would condemn as being simplistic but the question is is it that or is this the truth are we is the modern world the thing that's perceived that sees all these multiple kinds of things when the real issue is the one or the other choosy this day blessing or curse well what's a believer one who has committed himself to this view of reality and lives by it and that's what will make us in this world strangers and sojourners we will be strange strangers sojourners is one of the word pilgrims in this world this world is inhospitable to God it's that empathy with him because it's tune it's logic it's reason it's concept of reward and gratification totally different than other than that of God what is a believer a saint one who has committed himself to the biblical view and has steeped himself in these scriptures as if being the very predicate and foundation of his reality he will not be moved by any other consideration that's madness or insanity one or the other so yet a little while the wicked will be no more though you look diligently for the place they'll not be there that's powerful but the meek shall inherit the land not appropriate it or lay their hands on it or what's the word rudely take it to themselves they'll inherit it not a beautiful word i love that inherit it's something that you have you do not obtain by your virtue or your effort it's something given by virtue of your relationship with someone who has died and left it for you to inherit the land is to affect the very character in which you will live in it it how we acquire something very much determines how we're going to employ it to inherit the land is very different from rudely appropriating it and that's what we're learning now in the history of the present state of Israel but before the smoke clears we're going to see the different the alternative a surviving remnant of present-day world jewelry will return into this land to the land to zion as the redeemed of the lord and it will be given them as an inheritance and not an expropriation and it will not have the same savage consequence on those who were already in the land as the zionist enterprises had which will be the setting in motion those things by which present Israel will finally be brought down the anger the resentment the bitterness the desire for vengeance on the part of islamic arab people is another spirit you cannot understand it there's no placating that spirit you can't give them territorial consensuals or make other um as low agreement conditions that will gratify them there's one thing only death and destruction for these jews and casting them into the sea we don't just want the gaza strip the whole land we're seeing in history what history has always shown but maybe it's all the more glaring when it's performed by a people whose book this is who have not lived by it and had expropriated or appropriated or found one way or another to come in and to possess but set in motion the resentments anger the displacements i don't know how many how many palestinian christians that we know who lived where the present tel aviv airport is and had lived there for centuries and are now in ramallah and they were forced marched out of Israel many dying in the way just like the american indians when they were forced out of their places into distant reservations died in root this is part of the recent experience of palestinians so there's a profound difference between a human appropriation and that which is an inheritance and God is going to reveal revealed both in our generation the meek shall inherit the land anybody have a definition for meekness it's a beautiful word you know we it's a quiet you don't run to a dictionary for words like this words like this are like a rare wine you've got take it on your tongue and let it rest there before you gulp it down meek because this is the very character of God himself this is the essential nature of God himself learn of me for i am meek and lowly your king shall come to you lowly riding on the back of an ass zachariah chapter 9 and Jesus said find an ass about me it's tied up and if any man asks of you say the lord has need of it you'll find a cult and an ass you'll find a mother and it's young offspring bring them both to me and which of the two does he ride on not that you experienced older animal that has borne the weight of the man before but one upon which never man sat he took the weakest and the youngest animal and plopped himself on it and came down the mount delos you ever been on the mount delos you can't walk down and maintain your dignity impossible it's too steep i mean it's just absurd where you got to walk without it's just like a precipice but to come down on the on the back of an ass upon which never man sat and that's the king coming into his eternal city it's an absurdity it's a picture of utter weakness and foolishness but your king shall come to you lowly and meek riding on the back of an ass the meek shall inherit the earth tell me what meek is double dare you humble humble humble surrender but then what is humble what surrendered strength surrendered strength here you might but i know that yeah no you're disqualified before you're good yeah does meek mean that you're like a casper milk toast and you never raise your voice and oh are you asking me to be a speaker really i don't i'm not a public speaker i'm not no is that meekness what my brother called that salesman's humility it's a design calculated to obtain something meekness is is in no way something effective in order to obtain some kind of benefit or to obtain some kind of esteem or recognition or meekness is what God himself is true and true i mean so when i picked up an essay one day the humility of God i gassed and fell out of my seat i knew that we were called to humility i didn't know that God was the humility of God the creator of all things is is humble and meek that was stupefying but that's what he is and that's why he loves that quality in his saints the meek shall inherit the earth so have we come to a real definition it's so rich a word that no single definition will do it we have to apprehend this word not define it and be apprehended by it because this is the essential character and disposition that God wants established a willingness a willingness to be quiet and still before him knowing that he himself is your vindication okay what would you say when Jesus over through the money changers tables with a whip and scourge them with a whip that he himself made call that meekness he lost it he lost it he lost it he would right off the table what i'm really saying is can you be meek even in the midst of a violent act of obedience in fact would you have performed that act right except that you wouldn't yeah that's right meek means total resignation to the will of God however displeasing to ourselves a complete submission and surrender to God's will however contrary to our own interest and whatever the consequence that follows we do it it wasn't those money changers were always at the temple he could have at any time done something like that in his whole three and a half year tenure but there was a moment that the father gave because nothing happens anywhere that does not affect everything everywhere and what happens has got to happen in the ordained time yeah the set time to favor zion has come there's two greek words for time kairos k-a-i-r-o-s and chronos c-h-r-n-o-s chronology is the word that we use for that second word which is you know time as it's measured but what is kairos k-a-i-r-o-s the set time to favor zion is another kind of time it's not one that has come chronologically but one that has come at a point in the fulfillment of a designated purpose in God and the church needs to have that sensitivity that sense of what God is wanting and wait for it and not do something prematurely and before the time maybe that's meekness Jesus could have done what he did at any time but he only performed it at one time and it set in motion his death and it was it was a violent act that by every reckoning he would say well he lost it he lost it how about when Jesus waited after he heard that his friend lazarus was sick and yet waited two days longer where he was because the set time had not yet he wasn't going to act out of human compassion that this man that i love is sick hey i've got to go right now and help him he waited that's meekness meekness i'm just talking off the top of my head is allowing the will of God to prevail as against every impulse in our humanity to act otherwise meekness is a full surrender to the will of God whatever that moment of God's and God's requires and therefore there are moments when you'll act in a way that is decidedly unique it's not going to be a salesman's humility you may be loud and insistent and i don't know what absolutely what you say and do but that's not contrary to me because if that's what the moment requires is this is a precious state of being it's it's the very essence of God's own nature learn of me i am meek and lowly of heart it's not something i'm putting on or affecting it's what i am through and through and probably the most profound illustration was the washing of the feet as we mentioned the other day by Jesus well he could take off his robe not many of us can do that because to take off our robe is to take off our identification but what we're wearing how we report ourselves is the way we want to be understood and recognized and to remove that is to lay ourselves bare that we lose our identity who are we Jesus had no fear of the loss of identity he knew that he was from the father he knew he was going to the father and the father had given him all things therefore he got up and took off his robe and girded himself about with a towel and took a basin of water and washed the feet of his disciples that humility that act of humility was based on the deepest knowledge of God and this is what we need or else our humility will be a salesman's humility it will be an affectation it will be a play acting of keeping voices soft and oh are you asking me to speak really i'm not a speaker that kind of stuff a person who's in the meekness of God will be a public speaker when the moment requires it though he's had no previous experience he will not make an excuse for himself that sounds flattering because to defer from the moment of God's obedience because you feel that you're not qualified is not meekness but arrogance it's the very opposite of meekness and the world is so deceived that it's impressed with that kind of performance to say no i cannot when God says yes you will is arrogance not meekness meekness to say well lord i've had no previous experience but if you're calling me i'll trust you for the enablement and grace don't do it that's me the wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them how come you see this throughout all the psalms the wicked are bent on the destruction of the righteous they cannot abide their existence and the history of the church documents this the anabaptists the walbencians every apostolic movement even before the press for information was always attacked their death was and destruction was always sought by the established religious bodies how couldn't they let them be you know the men and knights and the anabaptists were called the still in london the quiet ones talked about in the land they were the quiet ones they made no show they were little communities of believers they churned their own butter they built their own houses they kept their own fields they were industrious they prospered they were blessed they were Godly people why couldn't the luference in the the state churches allow them to exist why did the wicked always plot against the righteous and are not content except for their life the righteous who are always an embankment of the wicked even when they're silent their very presence their life their character reveals the fraudulent thing especially of those who purport to be religious those are the ones who cannot afford their existence the secular are more able to tolerate them but those who purport that they are religious and are in relationship with God but do not evidence the same quietness and sweetness and meekness and are bawling and luther and those of his generation believe that these anabaptists were of the devil because how come they don't curse they don't drink they don't run after women they don't do any of the things that the lutherans are doing it must be from the devil because every other christian who's born a christian and sprinkled is carrying on as if that's the way you are your sin is being saved by grace you don't expect to walk in righteousness but these people who are doing it must be doing it by the power of satan and therefore they need to be destroyed isn't that interesting that the women that were probably drowned for being witches might have been God's choices saints so this has always been a historic persecution and how about in the last days is this issue going to fade away as we come into modernity in modern times or will it become at the end as a cute and as bitter as savage as it ever was in the history of the church maybe more so amen this is a way of viewing reality this is the way the psalmist sees it and gnash their teeth at them but the lord laughs at the wicked for he sees the day is coming the wicked draw their sword and bend their bows to bring about the bring down the poor needy and kill those who walk up rightly their sword shall enter their own heart and their bow shall be broken this is another thing that those that are wicked shall die by their by the very designs that they seek to employ against the righteous will bring them down there's a paradox is an ironic thing that the very devices they're undoing so better is a little threat the righteous person has than the abundance of many wicked for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholds the righteous the lord knows the days of the blameless and their heritage will abide forever they are not put to shame in evil times in the days of famine they have abundance this is my song for the day and until i came to that verse i had not marked any other place i'm just going to read it and that was it when i hit that wow i did a double take because here's a promise for the last days they are not to be put to shame in evil times in the days of famine they have abundance the lord knows the days and he knows those who are his and that we have to believe this promise as against every appearance to the contrary i've even made the suggestion that the greatest provision for the saints at a time when we cannot buy nor sell is not what we store up but what we give away and especially to those who come into our midst who are naked thirsty hungry and in their terrible need and we have to share a little widows mic with them a last jar of oil and our last can of grain what happened when the woman did that for the prophet there was no end of oil and no end of flower and it may well be that in our generosity and willingness to part with the last thing that is necessary for the preservation of our own life and give it to those who are despised that will be the very key to the supernatural provision of God not only for them but for us i wouldn't put it past the lord at all that we will see those supernatural demonstrations and those that are being fed and provided by it will see it also is it what you're giving a little measure of this to us yes but in giving we release a flow from God that will amply provide in these last days that our provision is our generosity you see how contrary this is it's another wisdom this is another way and God is looking for people who will elect to walk in it though it is contrary to the wisdom of this world in every point and particular that if you give yourself to this way and walking in it by a faith that believes God for it it will mark you as a stranger and a pilgrim in a in the earth you will be strange that's the most uncomfortable of all feelings you will not be one of the boys you'll be looked upon as some kind of freak but david was beloved because he walked in this way that's why he had the insight to write in this way and this is the way of the world the songs are like a guide a textbook a a manual for last day's overcoming in a way that would have astounded us that it has not to do with assertion but with rest it's not to do with wheeling and dealing but with quiet it's got nothing to do with performance but with trust and that will be tested because the answer will not come because we're doing the right thing we're going to get the right response it may not come to africa so our last day's provision is our Godly character and just to boil it all down the key to last day's provision is not our stirring up but our Godly character God will honor and reward the blameless they'll not experience family that's his promise maybe we've been barking up the wrong tree and and uh giving too much consideration to the other rather than to be becoming the blameless does it mean that blameless means that you're spot free and you've never ever fallen that you've never sinned that you're kind of impeccable look my no hands sink with that's not a saint david himself was the most grievous of sinners but he was a forgiven sinner he came to a place through the blood of the lamb yet future yeah an atonement by which the blame was removed he suffered a certain consequence but in God's sight he was no longer blameless not because of some impeccability that walks such a tight life that's afraid to take a misstep but saints who have stumbled but are forgiven and are without blame in his sight the blameless i love the language of God if we rightly understand it no this is a revelation of God's mind and to know God how does it mean to know God to know what he delights him what he endorses what he abhors what's an abomination for him what what kind of character what what does he loves what when he sees in his saints what he is in himself and knows that it's not a superficial affectation and a put on an overt show but something that has been in wrought because we have steeped ourselves in the way of the lord because we believe this is God's word because we have made this our own and we sit and we walk in it by the grace of God and we encourage each other in that work listen we're called to insanity and how are we going to perform this who who of us has the courage and the strength to walk a walk like this by himself we need the encouragement of the saints we need to say okay but he stumbled but keep on keeping on and and being blessed and i receive your correction and we're out for something together that God will honor even in the time of famine and what a testimony for those who are desperate around us and realize that we have no material access if anything more than they and yet somehow our life continues it's being sustained and provided for we have little when they had abundance but that little is enough and it will be a demonstration of another kingdom come it's a kingdom to come but it's already present and already evident in their in their neighborhood
