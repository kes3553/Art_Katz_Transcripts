The Gentile and the Jew - Art Katz

He's not allowing me to consider anything other than a message given some months ago That precipitated the most violent physical response to anything that I've ever spoken I'm afraid to try it again. I Was taken completely Unaware as I was astonished that it evoked a kind of response from the man who?

Sponsored the conference of which I was one of the principal speakers and whom I have known through the years and Probably if I would cite his name some of you might even know of him When we came out at the final meeting He was standing by the entrance of the building leaning against the kind of a rail and I extended my hand in my typical manner to say sorry about that Sorry, if I have precipitated any kind of tension or issue or conflict I really was apologetic and the man who was he was holding his Bibles and some other books and Struck me on the chest repeatedly in anger and said cats You and your Jewish pride you and your Jewish arrogance And When I left him to walk out to the parking lot There was the worship leader Who whenever he could find the occasion would slip away from the room when I spoke I? Never Viya responded to him from the beginning And he said if any man had come like you and has and had spoken so repeatedly About Mexicans or Indians or any of the ethnic minority as you have spoken so consistently about Jews I would by now have hated that minority I Thought what if I start here?

What kind of response is this?

So here's how I Began a series of three messages that I'm going to try to telescope and give you in one night It's more a lecture Than it is anything else and the Lord just gave it to me naively in installments Because I had By the ordinance of God stopped at a certain American city the night before my arrival in Canada and learned of a synagogue That our hostess in that city had mentioned and I felt somehow that I should visit it So she drove us by Lovely architecture.

She may have thought I was only interested in the architecture She went into the parking lot and around them out.

I said no I want to go in oh that took her by surprise and so she parked in the parking lot and we went in and spent maybe Almost two hours there though the rabbi himself was absent and the secretary showed us about and I went into the sanctuary the architecture they the The aesthetic Appeal of that sanctuary the elevated Ark that contains the scrolls of the law the beam of the platform where it's taken out And laid and opened and the parchments are read It was just Remarkably touching and as we walk through the corridors and the hallways they had photographs black and white going back to the early 1920s the hadassah women's group the candidates training for bar mitzvah a Purim party with costumes as I walked by and looked at those photographs just something of Jewish community a sense of kinship what this people have enjoyed for decades in that community and it just touched my heart in a remarkable way and I mentioned something about myself without letting the cats out of the bag That I'd written a book of an early encounter that I'd had with God as a hitchhiking atheist and disillusioned Marxist and she said oh, I'd like to read that I said I'll bring it to tomorrow before I leave town at any rate I came into Canada still resonating from the visit to the synagogue and how it had touched my deeps and Something about this Jewish community life taking place in our midst altogether unknown to us and with whom we are altogether unrelated and somehow the Lord used that this is you're learning a lesson in the Preparation of a prophetic man for a prophetic word Using the actual experience of the day and the exposure to which that one is brought To condition and temper his heart his mind his disposition out of which a word of another kind is to come and here is that word I Said after 38 years in the faith and traveling the world over and being exposed to the people of God in every condition and In the world itself. I have finally come to the conclusion that Anti-jewishness is Intrinsic to all Gentiles by the very nature of things There is a latent and potential Anti-semitism under the surface of every Gentiles life and All it takes is provocation of a certain kind to have it to erupt and be expressed And then I began to off the top of my head. This isn't any scholarly work this notes that I as I'm Probing why that is what are the factors that are resident in our contemporary life that would instigate or Serve to turn Gentiles against Jews and it would could be something like Jewish exclusiveness the way the Jews have maintained their identity apart from the Parent the patron nations that have received them. They can be a little exclusive community of themselves and self-contained and barely reflecting or touching the society that has allowed them a presence and that would evoke something of a Gentile envy of What this Jewish life is that you know exists, but that you're not with that you don't contact either imagined or real social cultural economic superiority Something about this strange people that gives us a sense of a superiority that they may not themselves Feel but we suspect that they have toward or against us us being Gentiles they represent them and Depict something of a God of wrath if we read the Old Testament and how God had brought Israel out of Egypt and hadn't had them to absolutely devastate the pagan Civilizations that were in the land Ruthlessly and Spear not and utterly destroy It leaves a certain impression about Jews to an unregenerate mind that does not advance or encourage a Positive image of Jews but can cultivate even a sense of fear And if that's the way that they have dealt with pagan Gentile peoples from the inception of the history What would they loose on us if they were given the opportunity? The kind of a people to be feared maybe even a rod of God's judgment as it was against the Canaanites and These people convey a thinly concealed Content of the Gentile of the goyum those that are not like us and our other their rejection of Christ and Christianity even makes us to suspect that after all those centuries they still maintain that posture of rejection of what we think is so dear and central and and True, could it be that maybe we are wrong? Maybe we are in error maybe we are maintaining some kind of a fiction and that these Jews who are evidently clever and Analytical have not found reason to believe in all these centuries Does that dispose us maybe to question the security and confidence of our own faith their very presence is a kind of Sending of a little vibe Of those that would make us insecure and what we think to believe is true or else.

Why have they not believed?

Excuse me, their very presence is as an element That would cause Some friction rising up from Gentiles and Christians of a certain kind So that would makes us maybe to suspect our own creedal claims virgin birth You know the very presence of Jews in the Middle Ages Constituted an unspoken challenge to the Uncontested claims of the faith that when you really think about them, they are essentially Foolish and and Hard to be proved and Imagine shallow Christians in the Middle Ages Christians in name Who have been thinly indoctrinated about virgin birth about resurrection? Living in proximity to Jews whose very presence is a statement of rejection of those beliefs There is something that has come up in the whole history of Jews residing in Alien communities that causes vibes of dissension and contention that Jesus foresaw and wept What would be the consequence for the rejection of himself? We Jews have been an indigestible lump in every nation in which we have been cast Our very unbelieving presence Constitutes a kind of attention into the general Gentile communities into which we have been placed I'm not saying let's say the Lord in any of this I'm giving a little lecture on how we should need to understand something of what has gone on in these last Thousands of years that is a fact of still and under the surface not only of Gentile life, but even Gentile Christian life of a kind So if their very presence would bring into question some of the creedal claims that could now be open to doubt and that not only did that but that this very survival of Jews and Judaism and their prestigious institutions and synagogues their prominence and success Beyond their number in the population in the professions and science Prizes and Pulitzer Prizes beyond their number would even make us to question that how can they be so prospered and so distinguished yet rejecting our Christ Maybe we're wrong. Maybe they have a handle on something that that we've not understood and that their presence therefore raises even unspoken or unarticulated questions of this kind So What shall we say of the miracle of the state of Israel? that God is with them even in their Christ rejection and their rituals their holy days there's something about their presence and their position and their Demand that if we are to meet with them on the interfaith Dialogical table which is now happening between Christianity and Judaism is on the grounds that we acknowledge that their Judaism is as valid as our Christianity I don't know if you know that I learned that in seminary That this new trend is not to evangelize Jews But to have dialogue with them around the ecumenical table, but the condition that Jews Require is that they're not to be objects of proselytizing over that table but to be looked upon as in a position of equality as Having a religion equally as valid as ours and that we will as have as much opportunity to learn from them as They from us in the interfaith exchange that takes place at the tables This is a remarkable thing and the significance of it is more than I can take time now to express So they are not some little cowering community Of a minority kind just hoping to get by there's a certain thrust and even prominence even an aggressive character Beyond this small numbers that would rub Gentiles the wrong way Even Gentile Christians the wrong way if their Christianity is of a shallow kind Of course the Jewish claim that the Holocaust is a statement of the bankruptcy of Christianity is not something quickly to be dismissed and that What is really at the heart of anti-semitism is the way in which Jews are referred to in New Testament scriptures so that the root evil of Anti-semitism having its full expression in the Holocaust is the New Testament itself or Christianity itself You can I'm not saying that their view is the correct one but I'm saying it's one that they hold and it constitutes an antagonism between the Jewish community and The Christian community and I've even heard Liberal Christians agreeing with this indictment and saying that we need to review our Scriptures and maybe there are certain statements that need to be taken out because they're inflammatory at that that that that So it's amazing how much condescension there is to Jewish influence even in Christian theological circles And of course Jewish ethical Character is well-known well-behaved prominent in the community they don't raise their voices to their wives at least we don't think they do and They conduct themselves with a certain kind of the dignity that would be the envy even of Christians And have we sufficiently wrestled with the concept of their election Have we surrendered our hearts to God's right to choose this people?

Is he required to have a criteria based on accomplishment or attributes like ourselves?

Why would he choose a people like that and have a destiny for them who have blasphemed his name in all the nations in which? He has scattered them if there's not a real Holy Ghost Apprehension of the mystery of Israel's election I can see that that very election can excite a kind of envy and antagonism in Christians of a superficial kind Who do not agree with God's choice and with God's election or even the God who elects at all? let alone that he should elect Jews and That the Bible says Jacob have I loved in Israel have I hate it again sends a disturbing note into nominal Christians That God would elevate and celebrate one over another and As I've mentioned here in these sessions though we subscribe to the doctrine of grace We are more predicated on merit works and accomplishment as a basis for esteem Then we know The presence of Jews and the inability to forfeit their gifts and callings and To enjoy this kind of covenant privilege despite their apostasy Aggravation reveals the depth of our own Pharisaical hearts Because if they don't deserve the prominence that they enjoy and there's yet a future for them and a covenantal relationship that God is Obliged to honor it would kind of get under our skin and rattle us a bit so There's something about the Jew and their prized place in the purposes of God That would excite a certain kind of irritation on Christians of a kind who are more Pharisaical than they know who begrudged them their prodigal acceptance by the father and Refused to attend the feast that celebrates their return as I spoke earlier today Now we would secretly prefer that they blew it and that they have permanently blown it and that there's no further prospect for their future and that we alone would enjoy an unchallenged and complete Basking in the father's inheritance We don't like the idea that they would have a place of return by which they would be given a ring a robe and a feast Because we don't have the flawless thought and we feel that they deserve a permanent rejection having squandered their inheritance So we are uncomfortable in acknowledging God as the God of Jacob and And Give scant acknowledgement that we have been grafted into their tree. You know that I really see any acknowledgement by Christians of Gratitude that God has allowed you who were far off without hope to be taken in and grafted into their tree They were broken off that you might be grafted in Who were wild branches who by the very nature of your wildness could not bear fruit? The only reason that you're fruit-bearing or capable of being fruit-bearing is that you have been grafted into their tree It's remarkable how there's an unspoken Unwillingness to acknowledge that connection and to and not to See how grateful we ought to be for the privilege that they were broken off that we might be grafted in And I even suspect that though we are grafted in We may condemn ourselves to be not fruit-bearing if we do not if we're not grafted in with gratitude If we do not understand and appreciate the privilege of being grafted into this tree their tree Whose roots are in God and who sat and life is his life flowing through the roots and out to the members We lose the value of the life and the ability to bear fruit if we're not grafted in with gratitude and Spiritually understand and appreciate that privilege and that may explain more than we know Why it is that the church is relatively fruitless? Because God is not going to allow the benefit of the sap of his life to flow out to branches That are not grateful in the privilege which is theirs to be grafted into Israel's tree You need to know understand the depth of Gentile pride and intransigence even as Christians and that We need to be reminded that the God whom we celebrate in worship is their God It's the God of Jacob and the God of Israel and I will never forget how I was in Nuremberg and Walking around in a village in a town nearby before the meetings the evenings meeting and visiting a Jewish cemetery That goes back to the 15th century Whose tombstones were so thick of granite that the Nazis could not topple them and you could still barely discern Something of the Hebrew that the that the weather and age had not be faced I can't tell you the sense of melancholy for Jew like myself To walk through a Jewish cemetery in Germany and to see the continuum of Jewish life that goes back to the expulsion from Israel In 70 AD and taken up into the Holy Roman Empire and that which subsequently became Germany and then to come into the meeting and stand in front of a German audience having a great charismatic time and To say to them. How is it that my people have lived in your presence for 2,000 years and never knew that? The God whom you celebrated is their God Didn't you convey to them that your God is the God of Jacob and the God of Israel And when I raised that question, I watched German jaws drop. I mean that They're actually like someone had hit them in the solar plexus that they they air went out of them No, they had never really considered that their God is the God of Jacob and the God of Israel And so I had a thought that I'm not saying thus saith the Lord But I think until that acknowledgement comes and comes not reluctantly but gratefully We lose something of the value of that God We do not know him as we thought Until we know that he's a God who's not ashamed as being designated the God of Jacob Because Jacob is a supplanter a schema and we know that the long dealings that he had to Receive at God's hand before he could become an Israel and yet God instead of disavowing that past and rejecting it Chooses yet to remember and to be identified as the God of Jacob.

The question is do we choose? Have we consciously made that identification?

Because if we have not I believe there's a dimension an important dimension that is lost to us from God as God But there's something about the mystery of this relationship with this Jewish people that has got to be Reconsidered And maybe for the reason of that loss we're trying to find some other avenue by which it can be made up and I just suspect prophetically that It has everything to do with our desire to find a source of energy and life and hope in revival If only we can find the revival that will bring to us a dimension lost from our failure to recognize God as the God of Jacob and the dimension that comes to us from the flow of the sap of his life From the tree into which we have been grafted because it waits on a grateful Acknowledgement of that privilege and we want to make up for that deficit by something external like a revival Just a thought and I wonder how much God will honor that attempt to compensate in some other way For what he intended in a relatedness with his people which our Gentile pride will not acknowledge or allow That's a heavy thought rock and that we're barking up the wrong tree to think that there can be a compensatory To think that there can be a compensatory something coming through revival that God intended in his wisdom to be obtained in our connectedness with Israel and What we've what are we in fact getting and who is the God of the revivals that we're seeing stimulated these days in Toronto Pensacola and elsewhere that have a lot of Activity energy dynamic going for it, but seem to subside they don't seem to bring a lasting dimension so that I'm not saying that you're obliged to receive my opinion but I am suspicious and I'm waiting for the kind of revival that will come in the restoration of The intended relationship of the church with the people Israel its tree and its God as the God of Jacob Well, I'll see a revival that has at its center this conscious Restoration of what has been historically lost I will have confidence that that revival is in God and not some spurious source that at the very least can be questioned if not dismissed In fact, I've come to a place you guys can pray for me that Everything that the church lacks it's every malady It's every defect can be traced back in the last analysis to the want of this kind of recognition of its relatedness to the Jew and when that centerpiece is lost We have necessity go off in deviant directions and find ourselves celebrating men celebrating dubious ministries barking after revivals of some kind of spurious and questionable kind that Don't leave us in a better condition, but it works We read for example The commencement of the three great chapters in the book of Romans on the mystery of Israel 9 through 11 where Paul commences by saying I would wish myself a curse for my brethren's sake that they might know Christ It's a remarkable cry and we say no Became Jewish to have this kind of hearts cry for Israel and The fact that we have not had it is because we so easily attribute that to Paul's Jewishness rather than to his apostolicity But if the genius of what is apostolic is this identification in this heartfelt cry for the lostness of Israel Then it's available to us If we will come in to the authentic apostolic thing of which this kind of cry and identification is a high mark It makes an implication for us of a radical kind if we don't just attribute it to Paul's ethnic Jewish identification with his kinsmen and The fact of the matter is are they not also our kinsmen that he would wish himself a curse for his brethren But is it are they his brethren because of the racial and genetic Generic identification or his brethren in the sense in which the Lord says in Matthew 25 That if you did not do it unto the least of these my brethren you did not do it unto me That God is speaking in Matthew 25 of something that he expected as a mercy coming from the church to the least of these his brethren and Some of the commentators say it can't be Jews because the only use of the word brethren prior to that time is speaking of the church But I believe that the text itself shows that those who are saying Lord When do we DC when did we see you hungry thirsty and naked are already the Christians? So who then are the brethren who are the least if not the Jews in their last days flight and of? Exile and movement through the nations when they shall be the least of these his brethren But are they our brethren is the question Not because we're born Jewish, but because we have been brought into their Commonwealth into their covenants and hopes Into their grafted into their tree The Failure to recognize them as brethren shows that there is still an in hospitable Disposition even on the part of Christians to recognize this identification in this linkage Talk about Jewish pride of which I was accused maybe the issue is more Gentile pride and even Christian pride Which will nowhere be more revealed and found out than in our response to this people They serve a purpose in God in revealing to us our secret hearts that we would never have seen or even considered except for their existence and what they represent and how they chafe us and how we keep ourselves at a distance from them and secretly Cannot find the basis for identification with them So we do not eat as a rule pray for the peace of Jerusalem except in the most perfunctory way kind of a 30-second obligation and then move on to other things Nor are we watchmen on the wall who will give him no peace till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth Why in Lodge as the church we are not conscious little on smitten that we have been ignorant of the mystery that Paul speaks of in Romans chapter 11 And when I said this in this speaking where I was assaulted I Said I have to reflect that as I have gone on through the years and I have had the privilege relationship with with Bible speakers of international renown Who have admitted to me aren't I have to say?

That Romans 9 through 11 remains for me a mystery. I've never understood it. I don't speak it It's just outside of my consideration. Oh isn't really But now I have to say how can a renowned Bible commentator?

Make such a confession so nonchalantly as if well tough about that too bad It's just something that I've not seen and I have to omit Why aren't you grieved that you are ignorant of the mystery of which Paul says? I would not have you to be ignorant lest you become wise in your own conceit I'm not faulting you for not seeing the mystery I am faulting you for your casual nonchalance that you can afford not to know the mystery as if well So what so I missed that one point but you dear me and that one point is central to the whole apostolic framework of understanding Is that the heart of Paul's whole? Apostolic mindset and you can afford not to know it without even a ripple Why aren't you ashamed that the revelation has not come why haven't you confessed and cried out and sought the Lord for it?

How is it that you dismiss it as if it's only some secondary?

Kind of a thing that you can well afford to miss because you have such a grasp on so many other things There's something in your attitude that needs to be identified and repented of as if this is not a Mystery of any real consequence and therefore we can well afford to receive the penalty of becoming wise or inflated in our own conceit To the degree that that conceit nullifies the character of the church in its lamb likeness Because conceit and humility are irreconcilably Different and if the church has lost its essential humility and has become conceited and wise in its own conceit How is it then the church in any apostolic sense? This is a mystery we cannot afford to lose and that our greatest spokesman can boast That they don't know anything about it as if it's not a matter of great concern is a statement that Should concern us So we have been witness to the ages-long tragedy of Jewish suffering as I described some episodes today Where entire Jewish communities were wiped out at their own hand Kiddush Hashem was sanctifying the name of the Lord by not condescending to those who were Threatening us either that we would convert or be killed But rather than face that option at their hands or submit our wives or daughters to their lusts. We slew our own children and Slip the throats of our own wives Can you imagine a Jewish husband doing that and then died either at one's own hand or that of a brother? So that when the doors were finally burst down and the mob and rage came in to take their loot They found every Jew dead at his own hand And I'm raising the question. This has been going on historically through the ages in Christendom and Has come at what Jews think to be Christian hands after all These guys were white crosses on their tunics. And if they're not Christians, what are they? They're not Jews They're not Muslims. This is a Christian brutality And why haven't we who believed thrown our own bodies in the way of the those that are persecuting? God's people Israel. How do we stand aside or look away and Allow this kind of destination of God's people even in their unbelief even in their apostasy As I asked the German brother some years ago in Berlin an older man who remembered the Nazi time He said odd I looked down from my apartment window and I saw the arrival of these brown-shirted Nazis with this swastika armbands and they were smashing Jewish door windows and yanking the beards of elderly Jews and and beating up the children making these Jews to Scrub the sidewalk with toothbrushes and the humiliation.

Oh, I said you saw that. What did you do?

So what could I do about I pulled the shade down and I walked away I want to say historically the church has pulled the shade down and walked away Which is a statement that we need to acknowledge and to repent for and pray for a grace of God Not just the kind of momentary heroism But something so formative in us and the character of God that rather than walk away We would rather interpose our own bodies between those who are assailing Jews and and their defenseless victims I said to a black brother here this morning. I have a sense that there's a special destiny for black believers with Jews To guard them from the outrage Hatred of their own black kinsmen who are unsaved and Unregenerate and can be provoked to a violence against Jews as being their exploiters and that you are called to stand between the assault that comes from your own kind against them that you have that you your greater identification is with unsaved Jews than with those of your own race and origin I Know that there's a Hasidic community in Brooklyn smack dab in the midst of a black ghetto.

What are they doing there?

They moved there from Long Island and other places where they had nice homes and even estates Because they wanted to be in a place where they could walk to their synagogue Because you can't drive on the Shabbat and the only place where they could find reasonable accommodation at houses is the rather run-down brownstone area that's inhabited by blacks and so right in the midst of the black community is this ultra-orthodox Hasidic presence and There have been ripples and resentments already in past years when I when a Hasidic kid driving a car hit a black kid in this street and killed him and there was a Three-day riot that was only quelled by the mayor of New York City who was at that time himself a black man So there's a tension so who knows that I'm not speaking of something of a Too far-fetched kind where we will again have an occasion actually to interpose our bodies between those who are assailing Jews and Be willing to suffer that violence upon ourselves rather than it should fall on them I'm raising the question. Why have we failed we the church failed to be that and to do that historically in defense For this people who are the least of these his brethren Do we share the Lord's ache and his an identification with them that in all their affliction he is afflicted Nor will we be the deliverer who comes out of no will he be the deliverer comes out of Zion Until we share his pity and cut commiseration for them as we spoke this morning out of some one or two when we shall have compassion for their stones and pity upon their dust So we do not anticipate the soon-coming time of Jacob's trouble Nor have we bothered to make any preparation to succor them in their exile and flight and leave it to others to prepare a place For them in the wilderness where they will be fed for three and a half years The question needs to be asked if we have cast away his people whom he has not cast away For Paul says God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew How then can we still call Jesus Lord not realizing that the restoration all Israel shall be saved waits upon some condition of our own when the fullness of the Gentiles come in and That the issue of his covenant faithfulness and mercy is the very demonstration of himself as God as he will manifest itself to a People who do not deserve that attention that the issue of their Return and their salvation because of the covenant which I have made with them is not so much the issue of their deserving as the issue of the God who makes covenant and is obliged to honor it and That if he cannot and will not how does he remain as God? That there's a jealousy that ought to be a jealousy in our heart for the fulfillment of his word his promise his gift his callings Especially with regard to them who are the least likely candidates to deserve such consideration But it's the issue of God's mercy and faithfulness not what they are, but what he is because he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy and compassion upon whom he will have compassion and can we be indifferent to what God's compassion and mercy is and And not be smitten that we are unaffected indifferent immune and even Little cool to the to his choice of of a people whom he has chosen Only when we in humility and gratitude Affirm the privilege of being placed for as wild branches in to their tree Well, we do not stand in awe and have become proud not recognizing his kindness and have not continued in kindness Therefore toward them and who will languish in that condition unless that kindness and mercy is extended through us Have we ourselves been cut off already more than we know though. We are technically grafted we are effectually cut off and not receiving the life because of this distance and Unwillingness to affirm the connection that God and his wisdom has required not knowing the depth of our own pride Even as Christians So What then is our supply if we're looking for it from other places and who is supplying it? What is our quest for revival independent of the life that comes from the conscious connection with the mystery of Israel? Can God possibly honor that and defeat his own purposes and deny his own glory? Our Gentile pride and subtle disdain for Israel and the Jew runs us as the church of the life and grace Not to be given in any other way except through the way that was ordained in our connection with their tree and with Jacob with God is the God of Jacob and The fullness of the Gentiles that God is waiting to come in that he can deliver That deliverance can come out of sign Are we waiting for expecting and desiring that fullness?

What is that fullness?

It's more than I mentioned that this morning the issue of numbers it's the issue of Identity it's the issue of as Gentile Christians coming into a fullness of what is hebraic and what is the vidic? What God intends for us from a salvation which was of the Jews it's not that it just belongs to them, but it brings a quotient and a Consequence a benefit of a very particular kind that is Transforming and saves us out of our gentilism and brings us into a Quality of being of reality and life that is hebraic that is the vidic That is really a salvation to the uttermost and it's that fullness for which God waits It'll not come to us in our indifference it will come to us in our seeking and In out and in the recognition of the connection that God intends in his wisdom with this people Even in their present lostness So, how do we break That Vestigial Gentile pride that has kept the church historically from the connectedness with this people that God intends and I I want to conclude with a verse in Genesis of the Blessing that Noah prophesied over his three sons and have has a lasting significance right to the present moment That needs to be fathomed when Noah said Cursed be Cain and the servant of servancy shall be to his brothers but he also said blessed be the Lord the God of sham and Let Cain and be his servant May God enlarge Japheth and let him dwell in the tents of sham and let Cain and be his servant The message that I concluded with where the man struck me with his Bibles and anger Was an invitation for the Japheth church That has been enlarged to come in to the tenth of sham That there's something in the wisdom of God That Japheth is blessed in his enlargement and all of the European nations have reflected that including Great Britain Technology commerce trade culture Japheth is enlarged but the very thing that enlarges him and blesses is also contains a prospect for destruction as We have seen from Germany as we have seen even in the imperial policy and conduct of Great Britain itself That Japheth left to himself in his enlargement can be a much as source of curse as a blessing Except he come and dwell in the tents of sham There's something to be found in sham of a unique blessedness and the fact that it's a tent is suggestive of a certain kind of spiritual disposition of a people who have not found the world and Made it there.

They are transient. They are pilgrims.

They're sojourners But the thing is that Jews themselves who are called to constitute that tent are more today like Japheth than they are like sham we ourselves Excel in the field of technology and military power and and all of these kinds of things so God's resolution for mankind to take the brittle edge off of the Gentile nations to compensate for their hardness and their pride and the arrogance that comes with their Enlargement through their ability is to be found in one place only the tent of sham where there the God of sham Resides and brings a certain quotient and presence of a spiritual kind that will militate against the rough aggressive proud Character that necessarily will follow Japheth because of his enlargement.

Do you understand this mystery?

The end of the age is the sons of Japheth the European nations Bending and bowing to enter the tent of sham and dwelling there to receive there alone That dimension from God that saves Japheth from himself That saves men from their own ability their own aggressiveness their own pride because there's something in sham and the God of sham that is a compensation is a quality in a character of another kind and it's only to be found there and So I gave a final invitation at that conference and this is when my host went bonkers. I Invited every Gentile Christian in the audience Who heard themselves being described by the material that I've shared with you to one degree or another realizing that their distance and difference from the Jew and a Disposition of hostility and irritation is theirs even as Christians and That something needs to be broken that can be broken only in a unique way that God has intended when you enter the tent of sham that that Characteristic that Gentile thing that survives and is carried with us even into the faith and into the church Needs to be broken into one place that God intends the tent of sham, but you can't enter that tent without bowing It requires a breaking in bowing in order to enter and to dwell and this is the thing from which a proud religionist would shrink And I gave an invitation for as many in the congregation who sense that something remains of their Gentile Inheritance that is antagonistic to a Jews that has not allowed them the acknowledgement of the privilege of being grafted into their tree and receiving the life that flows from its roots and Have sort other compensatory ways outside of the mystery of God's intention and provision with this people To come and break by bowing to enter What would you have done if you had heard that invitation and recognize that in fact you need it and That something will linger of a Gentilic Resistant Japheth kind that can only be met and broken in bowing and entering So I finished my message and I was picking up my bottles and this brother who is a sponsor came and took the microphone I thought oh praise God God has touched his heart because he is a Gentile of the Gentiles Canada Anglo-Saxon British Colony still retaining this essential Superiority and indifference of it all praise God the Lord has spoken to his heart and he's going to take the microphone and say to the congregation the Lord has really Revealed my deepest need I had not recognized it till I heard these things from God and I want to say I want to be the first to break and bow and enter the tent of Shem and Find their dimensions for my own Christian life that wait for me only in that place Instead I could not hear him because my I wasn't wearing my hearing aids and I was behind he was in front and what he was saying was I Nullify this invitation this is bowing to another God and he went on like that and I didn't hear that And when he handed me back the microphone not having heard what he said, I said my invitation still stands And you know what the heck of it is people came forward with weeping to bow and to break and to enter and Then the meeting ended and I went out the building and there he was standing by the railing and I extended my hand in my Apology and the man reacted with such anger He actually beat me on my chest with his Bibles and books cats you and your Jewish pride you and your Jewish arrogance I thought to myself well Maybe there is something of an arrogance and pride But why identify it as Jewish? You know what I said to him I said dear brother Had you entered a hip had you bowed to enter that tent? you would have seen everything differently from the new light and perception and Revelation of a kind that would have been available to you only in that place and what you have described as arrogance You would have seen as a perfect obedience to the God who had me both to speak and to invite Well, is that a concluding message Is that a mystery?

For how does the age end?

in Zechariah chapter 14 That all who survive of the nations Who have opposed Israel in verse 16 chapter 14 of Zechariah? That have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the festival the feast of booths of Tabernacles and if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of hosts There will be no rain upon them and If the family of Egypt do not go up and present themselves think of the humbling here and present themselves and go up and present themselves is At entering the tent of Shem. It's a breaking of Gentile pride it's an acknowledgement of the nations that God has honored and celebrated this nation and Something will be to their benefit that will save them from their own Japheth character if they will come up and present themselves and bow to enter the place that God has identified Where they are to find blessing in a redeemed Israel? So That shall be the punishment of verse 19 of Egypt the punishment of all the nations that do not do not go up to keep the festival of booths the in gathering of the nations and on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses holding to the Lord and then a further description of the holiness that comes Into Jerusalem as the redeemed people of God there shall no longer the last verse be Traders or Canaanites in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day the footnote of the of these verses at the bottom of my page says That Zachariah celebrates the restoration of the temple and of Israel's place in the purposes of God That finally become fit to serve as a worship center for the whole world in the New Age The One outrage of Jesus that overturned the money changes tables was not against sacrifice Was not against the priesthood that had lost its character It was against those who had turned the house of prayer for all nations into a place of merchandise What what grieved the soul of Jesus to an act of violence in overturning the tables? That his house is intended as a house of prayer for all nations And you have made it a house of merchandise and a den of thieves the whole purpose for your being as my elect nation was to offer to the nation's attempt a place to come to dwell to worship the trying to recognize and to be touched and to be blessed and to be receive the redemptive benefit of Coming to the locus of my own presence in a redeemed Jerusalem to come into my house and into my tent but you have kept the nations at a distance by not fulfilling your call and Turning a house intended as prayer for the nations into a place of merchandise and a den of thieves Unless you understand the heart of Jesus that that led him to be physically violent in overturning it You'll not understand the mystery of the 10th of Shem Which is the tabernacle of God which is the house of worship for all nations? Which is the coming into the place that God has designated for the Japheth peoples of the world? Who left to themselves and without the tempering benefit that comes from the presence of God in the 10th of Shem alone Will be a destructive force in the world as we have seen in both world wars and may yet again see There's a mystery dear Saints and the people that God has called to constitute that tent Ironically are themselves more like Japheth than they are like Shem look at Israel today in its commerce its trade its power its military Thing it's high-tech society How are they going to be to the Gentile nations what they want when then themselves have become Gentile eyes and want to be the Hong Kong of the Middle East and not the haven and the house of God for all nations Something has got to be demonstrated to them of their own call by a people who have come into the Shemite identity the church and will demonstrate to Israel what its own calling is all the more radically When we can demonstrate it authentically not being Jews by birth, but Samites by inheritance and by by Acquisition and by our identity with their tree and with their God and God of Jacob and the whole Davidic Inheritance, which is ours through scripture and through the spirit Paul says I'm the man out of time and out of joint What you see in me is a picture of the calling of my own nation as I have I am the apostle to the Gentiles Isn't that remarkable that this man with this great? Talmudic and rabbinical background is made the Apostle to the Gentiles and Peter the fisherman is made the Apostle to the circumcision What is God up to? What he's up to is this that Paul is demonstrating in his relationship to the Gentile Church What is the future of the redeemed Israel to the Gentile nations? And we don't even know it as Jews You have got to demonstrate to us.

What is our own?

Semitic calling By showing us our apostolate by your own conduct and the reality that you Exhibit in the truth of your own faith, which is Semitic in the deepest and truest sense because you constitute the tent into which even the Jewish people must come and bow and break from their own perverse Corruption and find their own true identity in what you have found before them spiritually This tent of shame is a mystery But you need to bow to break to enter it I want to pray for a church That will raise up the tent that has fallen down That the people for whom it's intended might find in what you have retained and established Their own call their own identity and be to the nations what God intends and complete the mystery of redemption That begins with the blessing of Noah on his sons that Japheth shall be enlarged But shall dwell in the tent of sham so Lord This is an exploratory word This is feeling our way into Mystery into dimensions my God that have all been lost to us But we have to consider What would so antagonize a leading? biblical commentator of world renowned To so strike this servant in such anger almost to a fury and a rage and Identify my error as being Jewish pride and Jewish arrogance Because I spoke the things there that I spoke here.

What is it that antagonized him?

What is it that for which he was still susceptible and could be pricked and respond and so ungainly away in a man who is Ordinarily as quiet as a mouse whom I had never in all the years I've known him ever heard him raise his voice only then something Pricked him something found the blind side something touched him in his deeps that he reacted in an anger against what he identified as Jewish pride and Jewish arrogance, which is maybe more the statement of his untempered Japheth character even as a renowned teacher than it was of my own Character and condition and if a man of that renown can still have a lurking Anti-jewish Gentile Japheth disposition that has never been broken What shall we say of us? And so there's a there's a quality of brokenness that is becoming to the church that can be found only in one place When we will condescend to bow and to enter into that realm my God of those things pertaining to that people For which everything in our Gentile experience would keep us
