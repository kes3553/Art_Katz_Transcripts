Apostolic And Prophetic Foundations 1 - Art Katz

I hope that you approve of the topic, because it is absolutely essential for the Church and for the servants of the Church in the last days. What is a prophet? How essential are they? Are they merely an historic relic or a present phenomenon? Is the Church still built on the foundations of the apostles and the prophets? Or are the Old Testament prophets finished?

And we cannot expect their kind again.

Many segments of the Church feel that.

That was a phenomenon for its time.

And now we have the canon of Scripture and prophetic books. But we must not expect to experience the prophetic man. But Jesus seemed to indicate that Elijah must come. That there is a prophetic forerunner for the coming of the Lord. Both for his first advent and his second advent. And the last statement of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, says in verse 5, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers.

What a statement. It seems very clear. That there is an Elijah that must come.

And if he does not come, perform his distinctive function, that has to do somehow with reconciliation, fathers and sons, whatever that means, there will be a judgment.

So there is some speculation about what does that mean, fathers and sons. I don't know if it's true in Latin America, but certainly in North America.

We have what we call the generation gap. As it has never been known before. There's a friction between fathers and sons.

Lack of understanding. Lack of sympathy.

A real race of disjunction.

Maybe it's the spirit of the age. And we'll have a worldwide experience. I think it's true already in all the western world.

A clear friction between fathers and sons.

And it's something that I experience myself. With my own sons.

Who are affected by this spirit of the age.

We're another generation.

And change has taken place so radically and so rapidly.

That they have another mentality. Another perceiving. Another value system.

That puts us into a necessary conflict.

That may be one of the meanings, but not the whole meaning.

We may need to be reconciled with the fathers of an earlier time. That the church itself is out of sync with its historic antecedents. That we have not understood the unbroken continuum of the faith. That the function of the prophet is not the same as it was before. We have not understood the unbroken continuum of the faith. And that the function of the prophet is to bring us into a living connection. With that which has preceded us. Because a prophet has this kind of consciousness.

He is not only the man for that moment. But he is the man for all moments. The historical past is alive in him.

The patriarchs, the fathers of faith.

He is the product of them. But he is also the man who sees the future deeply.

And exhorts the church towards that end.

He stands between the past and the future. And he can reconcile us. For both ends. So I wanted today to begin with Elijah.

Among all the prophets. It was Elijah who was found with Moses, with Jesus on the Mount of Thessalonica. It was Elijah who was found with Moses, with Jesus on the Mount of Thessalonica.

It was Isaiah.

The great prince of prophets that he was. Of the sixty chapters of the Old Testament. Filled with the splendor of his poetic writings.

Prophets were often also poets. They were literary men. They had an uncommon facility with words. A few words were required to stand for much. A few words were required to stand for much.

And in that I have given you a definition of poetry.

Of course it's a spiritual to consider. Of course it's a spiritual to consider. Remember what Paul said when he came to Marshal and happened. Remember what Paul said when he came to Marshal and happened.

He said as even your own poets have said.

He had a familiarity with Greek poetry. He wasn't a narrow, stilted, spiritual man. He wasn't a narrow, stilted, spiritual man. He wasn't a narrow, stilted, spiritual man. He was walking on eggshells and holding his shirt. He was a full-bore man. He was a full-bore man. He was an inspiration for us.

We should be familiarized with the vastness of the culture in which God has placed us.

We don't have to subscribe to it. But we should be familiarized.

Because we have to address our own generation with words that are appropriate for their understanding. We are in the world, but we are not of the world.

So Elijah is the thing in itself.

The ultimate prophet. And the prophet of the wilderness. And God says he must come again. Elijah must come.

And what's the rest of that statement?

He must come and do what?

Are you ready for this great statement?

He must come and restore all things. He must come and restore all things.

You better get used to me. I do a lot of silvers. A lot of jasper. This is life. This is life. And it came out of the blood, sweat and tears of men.

What does the book of James tell us about Elijah?

A man of flesh and blood.

A man of flesh and blood like as we. A man of flesh and blood like as we.

Would you like that?

Would you rather see them in some saintly and idealistic mode?

Men who don't sweat. Men who don't sweat.

Or suffer any of the other infirmities of humanity. Flesh and blood like as we.

But Elijah prayed earnestly. But Elijah prayed earnestly. But Elijah prayed earnestly. And it did not rain. For three and a half years. His prayers.

And he was a man like as we. If the Lord gives us the time.

Or we'll have extra sessions. Up to the late hours of the night.

And the phrase that God uses with him continually.

Son of man. Son of man. Who me? You mean me? But you're a prophetic son.

And this is the genius of what prophet is. Flesh and blood like as we. But they speak for God.

As God. They're not giving an opinion. Or a teaching. As God.

It shall not rain nor do.

But according to my word. Let that sink deeply into your ears.

This is the genius of the faith itself. Because if our faith is not a prophetic faith.

Neither is it a biblical faith. Are you ready for this one?

If our church itself is not prophetic.

Neither is the church. Oh brother.

This is more than a schedule of services.

As good as they are.

God intends the church to be a prophetic entity.

In all the earth. In every locality. Where the church is.

God's prophetic witness. God's prophetic statement. As being the church itself.

In its own character. See how important our time together is. This is not just an interesting excursion into the past.

It's the most vital examination of the church of the last days. Which must come into all the fullness of God's intention. Which must come into all the fullness of God's intention. And of which God says that its foundation is the apostles and the prophets. And of which God says that its foundation is the apostles and the prophets.

Do you know that scripture?

I think it's in Ephesians. The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. Get the copies of the messages that were just given in these last few days at the conference. Each one was a statement on the apostolic foundation. Each one was a statement on the apostolic foundation. Each one was a statement on the apostolic foundation. And now in these days we shall discuss the prophetic foundation. And now in these days we shall discuss the prophetic foundation. Or the church is not the church.

Don't have some shallow and inadequate view of the church. Don't have some shallow and inadequate view of the church. Don't have some shallow and inadequate view of the church.

But to him be glory in the church. By Christ Jesus world without end. The church is the eternal masterpiece of God. The church is the eternal masterpiece of God. And not an institution to provide good services for men. And not an institution to provide good services for men.

No, but for him. For glory. For the end. For the endless times. It's not a vehicle for our ambition. To be a worship leader. Or a youth pastor. Or evangelist. God. You should have ambitions for that. You should have ambitions for that. Destroy the church. You should have shallow ambitions. You should have shallow ambitions.

And there will be no glory if it has not these foundations. Apostolic and prophetic foundations.

Brother, can you define that? Not in four days. Maybe not ever. That do not lend themselves to facile definitions. That do not lend themselves to facile definitions. These are not meanings that we can define. There are meanings that need to be apprehended. This will call for the best of what you are at the students. This will call for the best of what you are at the students.

And an apprehension of these great gifts.

And you'll know that you have it not when you pass the test. But when the saliva runs in your mouth.

Prophetic.

Apostolic.

You know one of the functions of the prophets? It's to God's language itself. And the primacy of words. And the sacrament of speaking. And the sacrament of speaking. The prophet is the man of the word.

And he's jealous for words. And their meaning. Which has been produced in modern times. Bless you brother. We've lost the value of what blessing means. That's a tragedy. Because the word has lost its currency. And its meaning. Without comprehension. Without reverence. To cry out against the abuse.

Of the shallow use of words. The prophet is the guardian of the faith and of truth. And of the words of truth.

And I'll tell you this children. If we lose the meaning of these two words. We've lost the game. We've been condemned.

To be a church as merely an institution.

A form of religious culture. That might bring some benefit to some. There's another great word.

And to him the glory in the church. How shall we jealously stand for the church?

And its ultimate purpose for him. If we don't know what glory is. Where do we go for the definition?

The same place that we go for the definition of apostle and prophet.

It's a word that needs to be apprehended.

May it apprehend us.

And in the day that it will. And in the day that it will. We will be ruined. Or anything less or other. Than the glory of God. It will make you insane.

You'll hear yourself saying and doing things that will offend many.

That's not polite.

That scandalizes the congregation.

Because of your insane jealousy. For the glory of God. I think we saw a little of that yesterday. Are you following me? Not bad so far. And I don't even have a note. Where's this coming from? It's divinely ordered. It's like something being unfolded. Indeed it is. We're not only talking about the prophetic phenomenon. We are experiencing it. It's being demonstrated right before our faces. You're privileged.

And yet you know what the remarkable thing is? There's no word more presently being cheapen than prophetic.

In my part of the world. Everyone's running after the prophets. Nothing more popular.

More instant than today's prophets.

People travel great distances.

If only they could hear a word from the prophet.

What kind of a word? A personal word. The Lord has destiny for you. It knows about your health. Personal prophecy. That people will run all lengths to hear. About themselves.

How gratifying that God really knows me.

And has a purpose for me. And he knows that my Aunt Susie has a certain sickness. That of course she will be healed.

Because all these prophecies are always consistently positive.

Pleasing to hear. Never troubling. Never speak about judgment.

As the true prophet did.

Invariably. As his very first message.

Who was the first prophet of Israel?

Abraham himself was.

But for the nation, Samuel.

And remember that his mother who had been barren. Gave him over to the priest Eli. From his earliest childhood.

He lay before the eternal light of God.

And one night he heard his name called. Samuel. He was a servant. That's what a prophet is. Did you call me? Samuel. But if the voice calls you again. Let him know that you are here. Speak Lord. And the voice came again.

It was God speaking to a child. But when the child heard the word of God.

He became a man.

In the hearing and the speaking. And so also will the church itself. When it hears the word of God. As the word of judgment. And will receive it. The church will have come of age. It's the absence of judgment that disfigures the church.

It's not a pleasant subject. We don't want to hear it. It's fearful to consider.

We want to believe that this is the best of all possible worlds.

And if it's not the best it can become better. We don't want to think that the world is under judgment. Let alone speak that to men.

Who have no such anticipation.

And need to be warned. That is the prophetic function. You want to be one? Oh you prefer not to be an evangelist? I think I'll be a teacher.

I don't want to bring the word of God's judgment.

To my nation. Let alone to my church.

For judgment begins in the house of God.

Some calling. So in the morning Eli said to the young Samuel.

Samuel what did God say? And he told him the whole word of God.

Withholding nothing.

Though it was a word of judgment for Eli himself.

And his sons. And his priesthood.

Let it be unto me. Samuel did not withhold God's word.

He did not allow a syllable to fall to the ground.

So God honored his word. And the word of the Lord came to Israel. Through the prophet Samuel. Born in obedience to the hearing and the speaking. Of the word of God as judgment.

He didn't allow a single word to fall. Nor did he change it. Or improve it. Or doctor it up a little bit.

Take the harshness out of it.

Not to change the truth of it. But to soften it a little bit.

Make it more humanly acceptable. The word of God as it is given. So must it be spoken. Even if men will put their fingers in their ears. And gnash upon you with their teeth.

For they don't want to hear that word.

And the way to avoid the word. Is to reject him who brings it. By stoning him or killing him. And every great prophet has died in Jerusalem.

Violently. Be a song leader. Who has a stomach for this. You know the way you are now. Somebody looks at you the wrong way.

Doesn't give you the acceptance or the esteem that you deserve.

You are offended, wounded. It may take you weeks to recover. Maybe a lifetime. You are so sensitive about your self esteem. And how you are understood by men. So. How's that for an introduction? Fearful subject.

And God says no prophet.

No church.

Not a church of glory. Of the apostles and the prophets.

Not only what they have said. Not only the breadth of their understanding. But what they are in themselves.

You know what an apostle and prophet is?

It's the thing in itself. It's not some superficial ability. It's not some external facility.

The prophet is the thing in himself.

You want to touch him. He's got a history in God. He's been fashioned by God. From his mother's womb. In the hidden place. And fashioned by himself. How do we meet Elijah? Suddenly he comes on the historic stage.

At a certain point in Israel's history.

Very comparable to our own.

Israel in a time of apostasy. Ruled by King Ahab. Who has married the gentile Princess Jezebel.

A vile occultic woman. In an unholy alliance.

Between religion and state.

Oppressive, deadly.

It has killed already all the prophets.

And Elijah alone is left. At least that's what he thought.

Who have not bent their knee to Baal.

But that's not the point. The prophet felt as if he alone were left.

Lord they have slain all the prophets.

And I alone am left. That's how you will feel. Whether it's true or not.

The prophet has to live with the sense of the reality.

That he alone is there. He's all alone. And everything opposes him. He's all alone. Except for God.

So what does Elijah say when he sees Ahab? As the Lord God of Israel lives.

What a statement.

In an age of apostasy. When nobody knows there's a living God. The prophet knows.

And he begins his first historic statement. He may not live for anyone else.

But he lives for the prophet.

Because without God, apart from God, he is totally alone. It's a lonely calling. Not many people can take that. We need human encouragement. A sense of sympathetic support. It's hard to be alone. Even with a living God.

Which is a word of judgment.

That's the end of Israel's economy. It's the end of Israel. And no sooner is the word spoken. As it was for me yesterday. Then the thought comes.

Was that really God?

Or me? You can't take the words back again.

They have been spoken.

But you have to live with it. Speaking for God. Because there's an enemy right at your elbow. Who will say the same mocking thing always. You really missed it. You really missed it. You really missed it. What kind of prophet do you think you are? You really blew it this time. You have done remarkable damage.

A prophet has to live with this word.

And it can be painful. Excruciating.

How does he know that the word that he speaks is God's?

He's after all still a son of man. At any moment his humanity can intrude.

And spiritual though he may be. Prophet that he may be.

He will never come to a time. That he can have an absolute confidence.

That he may not have missed the Lord.

Because he's a man of influence. And people hang on his words. And he can never live with a complete confidence. That there's not a moment. A crucial moment. How would you like to live? With that tension continually. There's a word for that. It's called suffering. But speaking must. Whatever the uncertainty. Whatever the tension. Whatever the possibility of failure. There's a moment of time that comes. When he has no option. It's not a luxury available to him. If there's anything he's the man of obedience.

And he must speak.

That is an exquisite anguish. Peculiar to the prophetic call. That's why God doesn't have many candidates.

Who want to be a prophet of that kind.

Much rather personal prophecy. God really loves you. There's a plan for your life. It's all happy.

And people call that prophet.

The word is sinking fast. It needs to be saved. Because if we lose the meaning of this word. We've lost everything. And it's a word under attack.

And the way in which the enemy destroys.

Is not only by opposition. But by imitation.

Flooding the market with many so-called prophets.

Making them popular.

Who do not represent the real thing.

And might well even be false. Is that the difference? This is the test of your spiritual maturity.

Your ability to discern. The clarity of your own spirit and heart. To see two things almost side by side. Maybe perhaps saying very much the same thing.

Seeming to have impressive credentials. One might even have a larger following.

Can you tell the true from the false? This is the issue of the last days. Is to distinguish between true and false prophets. By a church that can't even distinguish. Between the gift of prophecy and the office of the prophet. And made by a church that doesn't even know how to distinguish. Between the gift of prophecy and the ministry.

Are you following me? There is a gift of prophecy.

And God gives the gift severly as he will. Anyone man or woman can prophesy.

In a service.

But they have not the office.

Can we tell the difference?

Merely to prophesy does not make you a prophet.

You have not the call. You have not the history. You have not the preparation. You have not the service.

And the church has blurred the two things.

I can't even distinguish the one from the other.

How shall we distinguish the true from the false? Because you know what King Ahab's accusation was against Elijah? Are thou he who troubleth Israel? Are thou he who troubleth Israel?

You're a troublemaker. You're stirring things up. You're ruining the services. So you can't be true.

Because the false prophet never disturbs anything. He's always saying, the only problem is, that he says it when there is no peace, and he heals the wounds of God's daughter lightly. The false prophet is always light, cute, humorous, engaging, but the true prophet, you have to turn your face away.

He's pathetic. What a reproach. What an anti-social character. It's not good company. This is classic. Historic.

And it will be the issue of the last days.

You can't believe how important our sessions together are.

So where was Elijah before he confronted Ahab? There's not a word about him until we come to 1 Kings 17. And all of a sudden he appears when all the prophets have been slain and he alone is left confronting Ahab himself whose wife was the one who supervised the execution of all the prophets and he comes with a confronting word announcing a judgment that will fall. It shall not rain nor do, according to my word.

Where was he all this time?

When the other prophets were being persecuted? Was he some kind of a coward hiding out, preserving his fleshly life? He will appear?

What kind of thinking is that? Totally human.

God does not tell us where he has been until now.

To protect his protoplasmic life.

He's holding himself in reserve for the historic moment of God's use and he dare not appear before that time.

Though he's being acutely provoked. You say you're a prophet? Well then why don't you stand with your brothers?

Look at the condition of Israel.

Shouldn't you be saying something? What kind of prophet are you? Could you have resisted that?

When the pressure of men come upon you?

Religious men? Shouldn't you be doing something? Look at the crisis! Do you know what Elijah's genius is? He never did anything. He never went anywhere.

He never spoke anything except by the word of the Lord that came to him. And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah.

This always precedes anything Elijah says.

He was a man of the word who lived by the word and never responded to any other impetus.

However legitimate. Look at the need! That will compromise you.

If you respond to the need rather than the word of God, you will lose your prophetic value.

Needs will always exist.

But the prophet is explicitly moved by one thing. The word of God.

When it comes.

And God says, this is the foundation of the church.

Can you imagine a church like this?

So disciplined, it will not move, it will not conduct a program, it waits for the word however long it takes and is willing to suffer the reproach.

And it's painful of not doing anything until the word comes.

That calls for discipline.

Obedience.

A people who can live without action. Whose human senses need not be gratified. By seeing something, hearing something, doing something. They can wait upon the Lord and wait until the word of God comes. Then they speak, then they go, then they act. And it may be one act only.

One confrontation. One moment of truth.

But it's eternal in its consequence because they waited.

Can you handle this? Is it enough for today? Conceptually speaking, you can't believe the volume of what we have already discussed. Every one of these statements are like a thunder clap.

And when you ponder them, they are so opposed to the conventional wisdom of how we understand church and what it is that makes with success.

This is another wisdom, another way.

We need to ponder it and to reflect upon it and walk in it.

And it may be it's not your calling. But it's the church's calling corporately and it needs to be prayed for.

It needs to be deep intercession in all of its current and popular mode into its prophetic stature.

That would be unwelcomed. Resisted. Unpopular.

But if it's not that, how shall it call the world to God? How shall it call the church to God? The way Elijah did, how long do you hold between two opinions? Elijah confronted his nation in the power and authority of God. And that needs again to be sounded by prophetic men out of a prophetic church and it requires a suffering. What will men say? How will you be understood? What if God calls you to say something unpleasant?

Harsh?

Can you render a full obedience when the word of the Lord comes to you of the consequence to yourself?

That's prophetic. Well let's look at the text. First King 17. We've already mentioned some of this.

Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants of Gilead.

He's not even from Jerusalem. He's from some scummy suburb of a questionable kind. Gilead. Mixed bag. Questionable history. With credentials of so questionable a kind. That's why God tells us this. God's not just being geographic. From his very beginnings from his very origins until his end.

And yet how greatly does God honor the prophetic. That the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

Wow. There couldn't be a greater honoring than that.

That Jesus identifies his own person.

His own testimony. With the prophetic thing.

The testimony of Jesus is the very spirit of prophecy. So reject the prophet and you reject Jesus.

It's a costly thing.

To mock, to reject the prophet sent by God. Jesus identifies with him.

If you reject him, you're rejecting me. Children, I've been rejected. My whole adult life is a history of rejection. More or less. I've been trained for that. I've gone through a special school of the Lord. Not this kind. Another kind. A hidden kind that can't even be communicated. But we need that. Because unless we can bear rejection.

The most painful human experience that makes cowards of all men. How shall we fearlessly bring the word of God.

If we're afraid of being rejected.

But those who reject the prophet pay for it. Because often historically, the prophet of God and his word of soon coming judgment is God's last statement. His last appeal for the repentance of the people before the judgment falls. When the prophet is rejected, stoned or killed, the judgment falls.

It's something very serious.

To fail to recognize and to identify and to receive the prophetic man who bears the prophetic word.

They are inseparable.

And that's why historically to reject the word is to reject the man.

Can you take it? Are you willing to be trained to take it? Are you willing to be enrolled in another school? Not quite so nice as this. Nor so polite as this. Nor so pleasant as this. It's called the cross.

It's painfully applied that you should not be afraid of being rejected because you know that there's a God who lives when no one else does because he lives for you and with you in the fellowship of his sufferings. I once went to hear a man of God.

I was not disappointed. This time I was not. His every word was full of divine weight and content. Do you know what the Hebrew word for glory is? Do you know what it means?

The glory of God has weight but the lightness of false prophets is very opposite.

There was a weight to this man speaking. When he spoke he didn't get out of the concordance.

Something lived through through travail, through anguish of soul through the dark night of the soul through despair of where is God to make the statements he did.

I was starry eyed. My feet were off the ground. Someone in front of me said, I would go any distance to hear this man speak again. I would go any distance to hear him speak again. The man was the thing in himself. Just to hear him go, was a blessing.

He was redolent with God. To reject the prophet and you'll have every opportunity to reject him. You'll have every reason because with even the most profound prophetic statements comes the prophetic offense of itself it seems. The wrong word, the wrong illustration, the wrong tone, there's always some flaw some intrinsic defect I'm seeing what's going to happen.

Then you can say, oh we were so impressed at the beginning, but when he said this that was it for me. The prophetic offense just seems to happen. What bad taste. How impolite.

Why does God allow it? To give you opportunity to reject the man with his word.

That's the nature of the thing. You still want to be a prophet? I know that there's a moment that's going to come that you'll be misunderstood. But there it went.

The prophetic offense if they want to avail themselves and many do because they don't want the prophetic word because the prophetic word requires so we can reject the man we can reject the word and not be required of but you have to speak it and be responsible for it. Even if God himself was the one doing it it's a sacred trust to bear the words of God to men.

It's one thing to be a teacher and I praise God for teachers.

It's a God-given gift that can expound the word can exposit and open the word and draw out its meaning and explain it through skill and rightly dividing the word of God by a workman needing not to be ashamed but a prophet does not bring a teaching his word is not instruction it's the word of the Lord coming in an historic moment of time full of consequence even for the nation that's the sacred trust and the preparation of that man is different than that of a teacher much more demanding because there's got to be rejection and be unafraid and when he stands before King Ahab the cruelty and the power that has already killed all the prophets to speak to him the word of God uncompromisingly and boldly that's prophetic utterance so in the very first verse 1 Kings 17 verse 1 we are introduced to the prophetic man we learn about his relationship with God we see his boldness his uncompromising word the word of judgment as the Lord God of Israel lives before whom I stand there shall not be dew nor rain in these years except at my word my word will bring the judgment and my word will relieve the judgment who do you think you are? commanding the elements in a nation that does not depend on its rivers yes, it has the great Jordan River but it's nothing compared to the Nile it's not like Babylon with the Euphrates River Jordan is a spiritual river it's not the basis of Israel's economy Israel's economy rests upon rain the early rain and the latter rain that comes to men from God when they keep his covenant and are faithful to follow him and to honor him but when they become apostates and turn from the faith and their new moon which have become a stink in God's nostrils although they can't see anything wrong with it God withholds the rain through the mouth of a prophet but not even dew but according to my word who does he think he is?

arrogance? his word?

it's either unspeakable arrogance or profound humility what do you think?

how do you understand this?

a man commanding the elements I'm after all not God but I want to make a suggestion let me give you my opinion that if you don't straighten up God may withhold the rain but he spoke the word of God in commandment as if it were God himself is that arrogance or humility when God called himself this way humility is obeying God much more when men will misunderstand you for that very obedience you can't tell where the prophet begins or God ends God's word is his word God's thought is his thought he has no thought for himself he has no word for himself he's the ultimate man of God he's the ultimate man of God he's caught up in God for God he has no purpose outside of God his identity is in God that's more than the way we look at it we see ourselves as distinct entities and God outside of us and if he will help us and give us some assistance we will do for him for we are one thing and he is another but the prophet has come to a place and come to a condition where you cannot say where the prophet ends and God begins are you willing to give up you? then you could be entrusted with the word of God for your life is his life and you have no other for yourself the prophet is dissolved in God that's why he can say thus saith the Lord that's why to reject him is to reject God I think we need a break we need to do a lot of praying in these days I'm impressed with the beginning God has given I've been around for 35 years all over the world this is one of my most profound messages I have even been identified with the Elijah ministry but I can't recall a time when I have said so much so deeply, so incisively about the nature of the prophetic call in a shorter time than this of course the Lord knows that this word is not only going to you but beyond you in many nations all over the world you are the audience but this is going beyond you in a way that may not be given again that the church desperately needs to hear but has no understanding of these things nor can it have until the fundamental man comes it takes the prophetic man to speak the prophetic thing and it's a rare thing there are not many such men are there others who have your perspective on Israel? this coming devastation and destruction that will disappoint numbers of Christians do you know anyone else who has seen the prophetic text in this way? I have to say I don't know I have not heard of any I just don't personally know them certainly they are not among the popular men who are called prophets today for they never speak on Israel except sentimentally to give false encouragement and say peace, peace when there is no peace but those who warn of coming judgment it's not to say they don't exist but they are not among the known and the popular the unknown the unseen the hidden whom God is raising up there may be some one or two of you here who have this calling and did not know it because you were strange not like one of the boys another testimony one feels strangely troubled and one does not know how to express it one ruins everything one ruins the joy you have already the call it needs only to be recognized your nation needs you your church needs you and the word of these days out of this mouth and who is sufficient for this we need to pray this is not just a class this is a format for something historical and he's chosen this moment through us, but we're in this together you're not passive hearers you're participants in the bringing forth of an event which the prophetic word always is we pray so Lord I pray for these children so much is being asked of them and they weren't even warned they thought they were coming to another class another teacher another instruction taking notes passing a test graduating whose time has come desperately, urgently historically significant the church is at stake the nation is at stake help us who has given us such a beginning continue to unfold your heart give us the capacity to hear it to receive it the word of the Lord, the prophetic word in the name of Jesus mercy Lord in our frailty in our weakness as men and women help us not to miss the moment to revere it, to respect it, to pray for it
