Martyrdom - Art Katz

Well, bless the Lord. It's great to come unprepared. And I hope you'll not misunderstand me. Unprepared without a canned message, but utterly prepared in the Lord.

We ought always to be abiding in Him and to be instant in season and out. And I feel especially abiding this morning, percolating in the Spirit of God, which is probably more for your sake than for mine, considering the weight of the somber word that I have, which is at the same time both somber and joyous. Only the treat that the saints can enjoy is the paradox of the faith.

Something can be waiting, demanding, serious, solemn, and joyous at the same time.

And the subject that's in my heart this morning by the Holy Spirit is just that.

It's the subject of martyrdom. And that's not just an academic subject.

That's not something that ought to stir our curiosity as an historical phenomenon that has occasionally been the experience of a few saints here and there over the centuries, but as the normative and definitive experience of the Church in every generation, and especially ours at the end. And one not to be contemplated with a shudder like why me, but one that needs to be embraced with joy for the great privilege, which is ours, to obtain a crown and not to come before the Lord on that day bareheaded. So the Lord is just quick in the text that I very rarely look at, but I think He wants us to consider together Acts 6 and 7, which is the description of the first martyrdom of a new testament saint, because the things that are at the first are also the things that are at the last. I guess you're familiar with that, aren't you, that if you want an insight into the definitive and enduring things of God, Church, faith, we look at them as they were given at the first, where we have the pristine, first, clear, authentic statement of that thing, and we'll have a better apprehension of what will be also at the end. When all of the muddy things in between are taken away, and we come back again at the end, or the things that were at the first. So what was at the first is not only original, but true. So this is an hour of restoration, and I have this sense that we are on a collision course for such a climactic and glorious conclusion of the things that were signaled and indicated at the first, and that the issue of martyrdom is the very definition of the Church in its truest constituency and makeup. And it's not how we perhaps will end our lives, it's not the issue of our final moments, it's the issue of all our moments, that the Church that has made its feet with this kind of a conclusion, and anticipates it, and lives in the view of it as a forthcoming reality, is not the Church that knows how to die, it's the Church that knows how to live. It's how we live as martyrs that settles the issue, not how we in one final heroic moment give up the ghost.

You understand, Saints?

The final moment is the statement of all our moments, and all our moments are to be called to be lived in a certain kind of apostolic and prophetic sense, and that indeed is true living in deed and true witness. And the Lord said, you shall be witnesses unto me.

He didn't mean distributing tracts. He didn't mean button holding someone on a butt.

He meant, you shall be martyrs unto me, because to be a martyr is the final and the true witness. Anything less than that is an incomplete and inadequate witness of him who himself is the firstborn and the first and the true martyr of God. And everything that witnesses to him witnesses to that. And the great saints who have not loved their lives unto death were in that tradition, and I'm of such a mind this morning to believe that they're even around us invisibly, in this very service, who are not yet complete without us. If we believe that and knew that and sensed that, how different would our services be? To know that we're moving toward something, and every teaching, every study, every proclamation of the word is a preparation for that end, which is both glorious and eternal in its consequence.

So who's the first martyr in the New Testament? A Jewish fellow by the name of Stephen, who was a busboy.

And that should not be lost to our consideration, because we might romanticize and think that the great apostles and the great martyrs of the faith were men of a gigantic and heroic proportion, and that we somehow are equipped and that it does not mean us. We need to really understand and know that they were flesh and blood, like as us in every way, ordinary and yet extraordinary and the great genius of what the faith is.

Stephen was a waiter on tables. Let's read that in chapter six. Can we turn off the fan or the air conditioning? Just suffer a little discomfort for this method. There's something contradictory about pondering martyrdom under the comfort of an air-conditioned room. It would be far more appropriate to sweat a bit, not out of fear, but just somehow that's it. Hallelujah. Why does my spirit always breathe a sigh of relief when man's technology is silenced? Hallelujah. There's more in that thing than meets the eye.

We have paid such a price already for convenience that does not fit the noble theme of martyrdom and does not prepare us for it.

We need to declare war on convenience.

We need to willingly embrace the things that are inconvenient so all the world subscribes to them and will give us every reason why we should not deny ourselves. What does it say that for the want of a nail the shoe is lost on the horse and for the want of the horse being hobbled the battle was lost and for the want of the battle the war was lost and it all went back to a nail. The very issue of how we will act in a final and ultimate moment of trial is not going to be decided then, it's going to be decided now over the issue of air conditioners, an extra hamburger or sundae, and sensual indulgence that all the world's sanctions as legitimate may well be determined whether we will stand or fall before pressure and tension and demand in a final hour. All of our hours need to be seen in this context. All of our present living needs to be seen as pertaining to the end or we are not properly living. We need to have an apostolic view that sees our present moment in the context of the whole, excuse the language, panoply of the face, the whole tremendous extension of the things that were from the beginning and are to the end or we don't see a right. If we don't see like that we will have a very narrow and culturally and nationally determined view of the present. We will be locked in time, locked in culture, and we will lack a witness because we will be speaking to people from the very same vantage point of perspective that they by which they themselves in a word we will not be coming to them from eternity.

We will not be speaking to them from their heavenly place.

We will be very much at their level sharing their values and the only difference is we have a peculiar vocabulary that's religious and you shall be witnesses unto me is more than doing witness for me.

It's a being thing. It's a quality of life.

It's a condition and out of that flows everything. That we Americans, God bless us, are so doing oriented.

The doing is the easy part.

The being is what is costly and if our doing does not come out of our being, it's not apostolic, neither is it litmus. So this is an invitation to being a witness, to being a martyr and it's a thing to which we need to give ourselves now. So in chapter six we read in the first verse that the number of disciples were multiplied and there arose a merman of the Greeks against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it's not reasonable that we should leave the word of God and serve cables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honesty caught full of Holy Ghost, of the Holy Ghost in wisdom whom we may appoint over this business. So we will give ourselves, continue the prayer, and to the ministry of the word. And when they saying please the whole multitude and they chose these in a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.

That's our introduction to Stephen.

I'll tell you what, it gives us such a stabbing insight into the character of the early church, the apostolic church and the glorious church. But even something as ordinary and as mundane as the waiting on tables required men full of the Holy Ghost and the wisdom.

I'll tell you that we have such men in our midst today.

We would exalt them to such a high place in the purposes of God and of the church rather than the waiting on of tables. But I believe that nothing is small in the kingdom of God.

Nothing is ordinary, nothing mundane. Do you see that? The word mundane actually means earthly, ordinary, dirt, grip.

But it's in the ordinary places that apostolic character is formed. How would you have liked to minister to the Greek and Hebrew widows who were murmuring with a sense of rivalry and competition that was already beginning to fester in the early church and had it continued may well have innovated and destroyed that glorious body. That's all it takes is a little leaven to leaven them to the lump and for the Gentile widows to feel that they were getting shortchanged and that the Jewish widows were being much more handsomely treated by the Jewish church. And that's all we need in a situation explosive with racial and ethnic differences who have done in the church from its very inception. And we don't have to imagine that the enemy was right there at the elbow seeking with every opportunity to sow dissension and to bring down the church even at that level. And that's why the apostles who were themselves for the wisdom of the Lord said, Seek ye out among you men of good repose and full of the Holy Spirit in the wisdom because this is more than just serving because the small things are the great things and because in the kingdom of God there's no thing small.

Everything is fraught with consequence.

Everything has an eternal weight if we but can see it. The only reason that we are lack and helic and what's the word complacent that's it is because we don't see ourselves at that level. We don't see ourselves involved in the things that are eternal. We need to see things and if Stephen was anything he's the man who saw because when we come to the end of the chapter seven we're going to see that he saw a heaven open and Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. He really saw and I believe it was not a seeing of the final moment but a seeing of all his moments.

I'm such a privileged man. You can come up after the service and pinch me. You know how privileged I am?

I had been in East Germany many times and I'll never forget the experience of meeting a saint there maybe you know just an ordinary wife of a pastor in one of the one of the areas of eastern germany most known for its old cultic and witchcraft history and tradition and this woman in my every conversation with her always had her hand up on her heart her conversation was continually studded with references to God to the Lord and as she would say these things and shake it and look up I don't know if she ever looked at me she was always looking up always looking up I wondered what she was seeing when I looked up all I could see was a cracked ceiling with peeling plaster but evidently she saw something above and beyond and true and she saw it continually and she saw it whole it affected all her feelings. I'll tell you if you let this come into your spirit and sweep your eyeballs from apostolic texts like this you'll be ruined charismatically speaking. We have made such a cheap merchandise of the Holy Spirit to improve the atmosphere at our meetings or our defunct denominations the glory of the Holy Spirit saints is given from much more and I'm wondering whether indeed we have received that spirit in fullness it's the very spirit of monogam it is the eternal spirit by which Jesus himself gave his life about science before God what we have is something else and something other and dubious about it whether in many times indeed it's even the spirit of God too glibly too cheaply obtained and the evidence of the progression of it does not seem to transform people and bring them to the proportion of the kinds of men that the church insisted upon for the mere citizens of tables. We chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and he versed Stephen full of faith and powered the great wonders and miracles among the people. You know I just want to say this for a first time after being the believer of record of a century the word full are you underlining that in the text this morning you'll see the frequency of the word full with reference to Stephen it's as if that is the thing to which we must come that not to be full and just to have the spirit of God in part is to be somehow disqualified it's full or nothing it's all or nothing that is when you're full that somehow the resonance of God and the power of God and the reality of God issues something about full what that means take that word like a wine onto your lip and into your tongue and don't be too quick to swallow it down let it lay there and feel the prickly part of it and then let it slip into your inward and to bring a quickening warmth full of the Holy Spirit. How come we're not full because there's always a competition between spirits there's the spirit of the world and the spirit of God. How many times have I have I enjoined young Christians to cut their hair and let go of the little thing at the nape of the neck or to take that cutting thing off from around their lips that they call friendship bracelets or whatever they call it and the various other kinds of cultural adornments that somehow we have become so accustomed to that we don't even wince at the scene. I even heard reports from a sister who took off a star of David and I'm Jewish and felt an enormous exhilarating relief and a rush of the Holy Spirit in the building. I'm very careful what goes on my neck and my body touch not the unclean thing be separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and my daughters sayeth the Lord God Almighty. Dear children that we're not full of the Holy Spirit it's because it's to one degree or another that we have exceeded and yielded ourselves to the spirit of the world and it's displacing the space that should be occupied wholly and entirely by the spirit of God. We need to periodically examine ourselves and see whether indeed we are in the face.

These things are written for our admonition.

God forbid that we should think that a man like Stephen was some extraordinary giant of the heroic mold whom we could never think to be. He was a flesh and blood man like you and me but he was a sanctified man.

He was a set aside man. He was a separated man.

He was full of the spirit of God and the he needed to be that nearly to serve table at the commencement of the church's history. What do we need at the end of that history when the when the powers of darkness will clash with the powers of light in our final apocalyptic fury in which it says that the blood of the martyrs will swell the harlot of Babylon and that the beheaded of God will cry out and ask Lord how long before we are vindicated. This is the picture that the scriptures give both in Revelation and in the apocalyptic Old Testament book of Daniel of what the end will be where the saints will be worn out and overcome. And God gives the powers of darkness the right to overcome the saints.

That's what it says saints. I'm not making it up. What does that mean and why would God allow it? There's something that we ought to ask because the time is not far off when those realities will be taken close. You know what I've been saying to the church for decades in the western world? Shame on us.

The scandal of the absence of persecution. Shame on us that the quality of our Christian life is so timid, so predictable, and so inoffensive that many of us can go through an entire Christian lifetime and never ever experience opposition, scandal, reproach, persecution, or suffering. The very nature of the true apostolic faith guarantees a recoil against us from the world and the fact that that has not been our experience is an indictment to our shame. We are living beneath the apostolic standard or we would have elicited and provoked that against us long before. So I'm privileged to see East German women who are continually looking up to heaven and I was always privileged last year this time to be in Zimbabwe, Africa and to be a speaker at the memorial service of 16 saints who had been hacked to death two years before in that place. They would put you in the shade, every one of you, in terms of their beauty, their linguistic ability, their multiple skills and professions and qualifications of whom the world was not worthy. We're not talking about some ranchy ex-drug addict Jesus Freak off the wall who has just come to the kingdom. We're talking about people who could have made their mark in the world professionally and chose to forfeit all of that to live in a remote section of the former nation of southern Malaysia where it was troubled and whether after maybe a civil war a black government has been formed and most of the whites fled for fear of what would come but those whites that remained were essentially Christians and they remained because they were moved by the Holy Spirit to remain and to work out the destiny of this nation being willing to submit to a black government and take all the risk of loss of land and loss of life while the tribe that was out of power was yet infiltrating the countryside trying to bring down this the that administration regime and particularly attacking attacking white farmers and they moved into that area to establish a community of reconciliation and to live unarmed and to trust God for their safety and for their security and we're doing a remarkable job after several years in that area fish farms and chicken coops and and lifting up the whole economic standard of an area where that had been depressed economically for years and in that success one night abruptly and that's the way it comes in it comes abruptly it comes when we expect it least and how we respond and react in that moment that comes to us suddenly and without anticipation is what the whole space is about it's not our amen to hallelujah today that is the statement of our condition it's what we are in a final moment of extremity that will tell it and that moment is all how will we act when we're taken unawares and suddenly great threat of our very life is upon us was that situation and not even the dignity of being shot to death but being bludgeoned and cut to death by an act one at a time taken with with their lifts handcuffed and barbed wire and brought into a building and all through the night all you could hear is the thump of an axe with not one howl or screech or scream in pleading for their earthly existence i'll tell you that the black militants marxist oriented racist radicals who did them in will witness to ultimately and not one of them will stand before God with excuse that they had never seen the glory of God in the faces of the saints it was my privilege to be again at that place for the memorial service to see the burned out buildings where i've been years before when i first met these people with whom i was in correspondence and to know that the subject of modernism is not academic that it had come this close to home that i was an actual correspondent to both who had died and in fact the report came to me was when i was in new york city casing the joint for God feeling that i have a call in my life to my own jewish kinsman in the city of my own birth the great babelon and i said to a brother who was with me when we heard the report of their death i said the next report will not be so distant it will not always be coming from behind the iron curtain or in africa or in the so-called dark places you're going to have it right in the streets of honolulu and manhattan and san francisco and all the places where the filthy fierce powers of hell cannot abide the presence of the glorious and really and sanctified saints of God i stayed in johannesburg at the home of wealthy jewish doctor whose christian wife was related to the family one family had seven members wiped out in one cell swoop and this man was unsaved in a leader of the jewish community in fact the very personification of all that the jewish community exalts as being religious and ethical and moral and accomplished but unsafe and he said that you know these people used to bug me one of my great one of my best friends was among them who before he was converted was just a great fellow and great fun and we used to go to the bar and knock back a few drinks and he was a womanizer and you know one of the boys but after he got saved he became impoverished he was always witnessing to me and poking his finger in my chest and you need to be saved and i couldn't stand it and it irritated me and i was sorry for the loss of the friendship but he said toward the end arc these people were progressively changed and he said toward the end their faces had become radiant and they were no longer working on me the way they used to he said but even in their silence they were they were much more convicting than in the earlier days when they used to needle me and when he said that their faces were radiant i thought of this text because it says in verse 15 and all that sat in the council looking steadfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel you want to avoid monitoring just keep on looking the way you're looking which is nice but it ain't reading it you allow God to move you toward the place of having an angelic face and you won't wait long to experience persecution and opposition there's a world that is still at enmity with God and the darkness hates the light and still wants to extinguish it we really have a choice this morning about how far we want to go with God and how full of his spirit we really want to be today and i'll tell you where the radiance of God is compounded and established in the faces of the saints it's in the church but not a church of the casual sitting in peace not the church made up of individuals who come to send on sunday to sit alongside one another it's the church of a people who are together a church of a people who go from house to house daily breaking bread a church of a people who receive the word of God the truth spoken in love who will exhaust one another daily while it is yesterday who will reprimand and reproach and evict the word and and exalt and rebuke if they have to because none of us in this filthy world where the daily appeal is coming forth from potiphar's wife come lie with me you've got it coming none of us can resist that and stand before God single-eyed and pure and clean except by the strength the encouragement the exhortation the prayer the example that comes to us in the body by a like-minded people who are moving in the same way what kind of church do we want to be and i want to tell you things to move from near sunday services and midweek bible studies to the kind of apostolic thing that i'm describing cannot be obtained without a suffering it itself is a suffering it's a humiliation it's a being found out and though God does not explain how she even came to have a face like an angel and i want to tell you this is act six and seven is not the very next day after tentacles so it's only three or four chapters after the falling of the holy ghost on the day of tentacles we might be reading now of events that took place five six or seven years after the falling of the spirit of God and so the sanctifying work of God has been going on in the church and in the body to bring forth men like this for such a degree so full of the suit of God and so full of heaven that they looked like angels not sitting in the sunday pews but when they were being safe by their detractors and their antagonists who are ready to kill the very life out of them there is faith shown like an angel and this brother still has books that are their faces were radiant i said oh that's it now i know why they were murdered we want to keep ourselves from the from the modest course all we need to do is continue to be ordinary and to be satisfied with a christianity that is a mere succession of services and enjoy a biblical word and some praise and worship in the home and live lackluster life but if we want to glorify God and be a witness unto him who is going to allow the anti-christ forces at the end of the age to overcome the saints then we need to live quite differently now because it is in being overcome that we overcome it's what we exhibit in that final moment of extremity that is the whole issue of our faith and that all of the years and days that preceded are moving toward this one end remember Jesus on the cross and that's done centurion who was a professional murder murderer and had executed numbers of people on the cross standing by and watching Jesus in the final agony and paroxysm and suffering of his death but he saw something in the ultimate extremity of that suffering that he had never seen in another that when Jesus yielded up his ghost when he prayed for those who were who had brought him to the place of death when he did not retaliate in kind to those of his own people to whom he had come who were taunting him and saying come down from the cross and we'll believe you you saved others yourself you cannot save that was more true than they knew himself he could not say could not and would not that when he died in this remarkable way something was revealed that this dumb gentile centurion who had never been to hebrew school never knew anything about the scriptures or the messiah of God's plan of God of her salvation of redemption cried out even in his ignorance at that glorious demonstration truly this was the son of God now listen saying we're very close to coming full circle there's going to be one end of the age of demonstration of exactly this same phenomenon but this time it's the church on the cross this time it's the body of christ following its master with it so ever he should be ghost that leads us to the same place of final confrontation and suffering and death is what he experienced and what we shall demonstrate in that extremity of the final moment is the whole issue of our life if we screech if we howl if we say why me and how come and ring our fingers it's lost what did stephen exhibit in his final moments let's turn the page to chapter seven when he had reviewed the entire history of the jewish people with the doctors of the law and his detractors he was giving them a summary of the whole meaning of the faith giving them a summary of the whole meaning of the faith and finally came in first group 47 and 48 about the house of God and that God does not dwell in table temples made with hands or say it's the prophet who's he saying this to men whose whole religious life is saved in a temple made with hands they are religious functionaries thinking they're serving God and actually abating him because they think he speaks against the holy temple he was challenging and threatening their whole religious life their place of preference their prestige their gratification so will it be again at the end of the age when the religious and political forces symbolized by judge bill and they had come together in one final powerful configuration and will be challenged by us not only by our speaking but by our very presence because we represent another kind of temple in which the holy ghost dwells in full heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me say to lord in verse 49 what is the place that my left has not my hand made all these things and then something breaks out of him terribly impolite confrontational not at all politic he should have been wiser and and not agitated these people to such a place that he almost guarantees that they're going to rise up against him in a bit of mission theory but you want to know things he did not deliberate one word of what he said very much in the same way that i'm not deliberating any words that i'm saying i'm trusting the holy ghost to bring forth his own burden without my deliberation and i've already been warned you know i'm going from here what these hawaiians there's only about a six-day interval in minnesota Israel fearfully respect upon nation for 10 days if you can pray the number 15 to 25 i don't know i don't know that i'm going to come out alive and i'm not just speaking about the possibility of a gas and nuclear war i may not come out alive from just confronting the same i've already been warned prophetically in australia on this trip it's going to be an exceedingly dangerous time and i'll be standing before rulers and leaders but not to take what i shall say that God will be with me as he was with steven listen to these words then and understand it's not a man speaking but very God use this next and uncircumcised and hardened ears to whom is this thing addressed the proudest loftiest men of the religious establishment who think that they have it all together coming to a moment of truth and confrontation to hear something about their conditions as God himself sees it you stiff neck and uncircumcised and hardened ears you do always resist the holy ghost as your father's did so do you which of the prophets have not your father's persecuted may explain them which showed before the coming of the just one of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers so this guy's pulling out all the stuff were they actually there in the hour of the crucifixion pieces were they actually there in the hour of the crucifixion pieces whether they were or whether they weren't physically he's inviting them that there's an unbroken continuum of sins with their fathers which they shield and for which they have never repented that implicates them both of the death of the prophet and Jesus and you know how come his statement is true because now they're going to be responsible also for his death we need to see as God sees and men need to see as God sees if they're going to repent before his appearance we need to persuade men knowing the terror of God but i'll tell you what unless our mouths are yielded to the holy ghost to speak the things that he wants spoken you're not going to be confronted looking for spiritual laws a lot easier than this are you saved brother though you know God has a plan for your life the benefits that you'll receive by by accepting Jesus there's a lot easier to hear than you stiff necked and uncircumcised of ears and of heart how long do you continue to oppose and to grieve the holy spirit i'm not saying that this is for us the necessary word here's what i'm saying whatever the word is for the one before whom we stand or the people before whom we stand it needs to be Gods in that college does he have the full possession of all that hope that he can speak without compromise whatever is in his heart no matter what the consequence is for ourselves and i'll tell you what that as pastors and ministers if now we are afraid of the people of God if we're cowardly in the church if we're afraid to say something lest it offend and we lose the favor of people in the congregation who might walk out and leave us and go to another congregation and take their tithes and offerings with them how shall we stand before the enemies of God to stand before God and not before men is the posture of a martyr not in a final moment but in all of our mothers i'd like to tell you stories of what God has had to say through his mouth over the course of these years for which i'm not invited back and often if men could they would stone me for it and often if men could they would stone me for it i'm not celebrating myself things i'm as ordinary as season when the high schools drop out but i'm saying that the church of the end of the age must have this character or else it would find that will find itself another kind of church in opposition to this one and it will be called apostate you don't remember a single thing else that i'm saying this morning but you remember this that cats predicted that at the end of the age there's only going to be two kinds of christian entities the apostate which is the greater number of those calling themselves christians who are content with near predictable christian services and a much smaller remnant people called the people of God and the one will hate oppose and persecute the other and kill us and claim they are doing God a service dear children hear me i'll give a wrap what it's like outside today and how beautiful hawaii is and how idyllic and how romantic and does not lend itself to these apostolic verities this is the truth of the matter no matter what we see with our natural eyes and we will be wise to live in accordance with it rather than with the things that are visible i'm predicting that if we will not give ourselves to the radical press of God to bring us daily every bit more to becoming the students of our generation we'll find ourselves with those who have stoned them and there'll be no place in between no middle or neutral ground except the one radical place for the other and that our every day is determining which towards which of these polarities are we moving every day and in every way and in every decision we're moving to the one that's what the other there'll be two classes of people at the end one with the name of the lord of God in their forehead and others with the mark of the beast and i don't think it's something embossed in the last moment but day by day and action by action we're submitting to one or the other and the day of the lord will reveal which final identification you have given us don't think that we're incapable of deception of moving from the face even while we continue to pronounce the truth of the face we need each other desperately if we are to be the people of truth full of the holy spirit and of wisdom and of power and knowing that if we elect that it puts us on a collision course with opposition persecution suffering and death when he said those things when he said those things and when they heard those things in verse 54 they were cut to the heart what a what an eternal moment came to those men they were pierced through and they had one or two choices to fall at the feet of steven and say men and brethren what what must we do to be saved or to pick up stones to kill them how'd you like to be that kind of preacher that your preaching is of such a kind that it leaves men with only one of two alternatives either a cry out what must i do to be saved because they appear to the heart or because they cannot abide what you're saying to put their fingers in the ears and to run on you with one accord as if as if crush the very life out of you how'd you like to be a preacher of the one or the other we all like to see men fall before God repentantly we all like to see the powerful work of the spirit to bring people to a place of truth but i want to tell you things if we're not prepared for the other response God will never give us for the one for the other if we're not prepared for those who will rush upon us with one accord will not be used for those who will fall at our feet and cry out what must we do it's the nature of the face they were cut to the heart that they didn't repent but they mashed on him with their teeth vexed unbearably by by all this man represented if only he were not there if only we did not have to contend with him if only we were not indicted by his angelic face by the conviction of his speaking by the anointing of what he speaks the penetration if only we could go on with the sham of the kind of judaism that we want to perform which we enjoy and people are willing to pay for everything would be okay but his very existence blows the whistle on us and makes the thing that we celebrate to be a lie that's the way it shall be at the end the very presence of God's people will condemn and reveal what it's false and i'm sharing them these days how as a young believer after being saved in brisbane on a year's leave of absence from the teaching profession to come back to california as one of the leading faculty radicals with a bible under my arm and say Jesus is the answer have you ever had the experience of losing all your friends in one night as i have had when they had a homecoming party for me and i shared my testimony and i never saw such anger and bitterness and vexation as erupted that night by a man whom everybody loved when i was a filthy adulterer like themselves the next day in the car with a jewish woman at whose home i was staying a colleague at the school that she broke out into such a vile and filthy bitter vocabulary that i opened the door and got out of a moving car how come people love me as a marxist as a communist as a humanist as a pragmatist as an existentialist and hated me as a believer i'll tell you that the evidence of their bitter violent hate was the greatest and first evidence i have had that i had entered another kingdom in fact and so i was one day in the cafeteria with one of these jewish colleagues a woman and she was so bugged by me i was i'm always witnessing you know how clumsy we are when we were young in the lord and always wanting to say something for God and by the way the entire church that i attended was filled with converts out of my classes the whole youth section many adults i had an adult night class student they were being shaved everything like that because i was too dumb to know that there's a difference between the sacred and the secular for me life and death was always at stake and even in a history classroom and that the holy ghost is not to be reserved for sunday services but right into the secular place the power and the penetration of God well i asked students in a discussion about life after death what is the remedy and none knew and someone remembered that when we studied the history of Israel there's something about sacrifice and blood and i took my bible right above the desk and read isaiah 53 under the anointing of the holy spirit in a high school classroom in oakland california and said to the students by the same anointing if you'll not come to church God has voted church to you and gave an invitation guess what happened 17 trembling hands went up but i didn't last too long as a teacher in that system i got promoted by God oh dear saints the world needs again to see the apostolic faith the apostolic passion the apostolic integrity they will not be satisfied with the world's definitions and categories of sacred and secular and break right through because eternity is at stake and men are perishing and the lord is at the door and we need to persuade men knowing the terror of God it will cost us everything when they heard these things they were cut to the heart they gnashed on him with their teeth but he completely opposite what a contrast the religious and the ultimately spiritual but he being full of the holy ghost again looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and of Jesus standing at the right hand of God that was more than just a little ceremonial picture Jesus at the right hand of God is a statement of the government of God from heaven that determines all things that on earth including our death you know why those things in zimbabwe could be half to death without one streak and one how and one piece of their lives that would came in the middle of the night and they were taken by astonishment without preparation and never sought to arm themselves because they believed that God was their defense because if this was happening then God himself had appointed it for purposes for which they did not need explanation that some mystery was being worked by the sacrifice of their death that did not have to be explained to them though they were doing good it was abruptly terminated in the most vicious and cruel way how'd you like to be the elder of that fellowship and come into that building and see the the dismembered remains of your congregation how'd you like to be a husband and see your wife and pieces and come in there and receive from the hands of men something that God has ordained or do you believe that what comes from the hands of men is what they deserve come on confess after your sins even now are you victims of circumstance or is God sovereign king in heaven and at the right hand of the father even now if you can look that fastly being full of the spirit and see an open heaven and know it because we will not believe it now if we don't get the right income tax return or the promotion at work or getting snubbed by a boyfriend or girlfriend or this goes wrong with that and we think it's men and we think it's circumstance and not God how should we be prepared for the final and open expression of the sovereignty in the world pantheist pilot had Jesus in the palm of his hand and the lord was silent aren't you going to defend yourself don't you know i have the power to release you or to execute you and Jesus said in that wonderful peace you could do nothing against me except it will give you some of those come on saints we need to walk through this world that is going to become increasingly vile and vicious and violent particularly against the saints of God whose faces are angelic with a complete equanimity and peace and security you could do nothing except it was giving you from above and if it's giving you from above i can bear it because the one who allowed you gives me also the grace to bear it all of you know the history of the martyrs and and when they talked with one another in themselves and said when you when you're brought to the stake and they ignite that fire if there's a grace of God that enables you to endure the suffering of the pain raise your hand to us you know what happened when those things were put we're bound at the stake and and they and they lit that vile thing beneath them and the flames crackled and the smoke went up in the enormous heat and the flesh began to stink while they were yet alive and the fire rent their cords from their arms they raised their hands and they praised God in the midst of their suffering and when the powers of the air the principalities and the powers of darkness and the world rulers of this darkness see that they are finished what more can they do to intimidate and to threaten when people in the midst of the suffering that is the consequence of the faith praise God at in the heart of it they're not at all intimidated or threatened today because to praise God in comfort and security and being well fed and the beauty of this environment is that there's one thing but to praise God in the midst of our sufferings and our afflictions is another that's the final testimony that's the final witness not only to men but to the powers of the air that they cannot abide nor entertain it destroys them will they perform it on that day they depend on how we're living on this day he being full of the ghost and full of the holy ghost looked up dead fast not just in that moment all of his moments he looked up all of his moments he saw the sovereignty of God he was never a victor he couldn't have to be explained to him why the he being full of the holy spirit and wisdom why the he being full of the holy spirit and wisdom and doing so much good for the church and performing science and wonders should be abruptly taken while he was yet a youth isn't that wasteful couldn't God have used him why did he have to be taken like that he never asked but there was one man before whose feet the garments were laid of those who stoned people to death a bitter vect jew a hebrew of the hebrew is the price of the rabbi gamaliel a persecutor who was breathing out murderings and threatening to the church himself who saw something that day beyond religion that was such a prick and such a goat he could not swallow it down it haunted him he couldn't sleep at night seeing the angelic face of steven saying lay not this thing to their charge what would we have like to say in the last moment when the stones are something into our face and breaking our noses and the blood rolling into our eyes and we can taste our own blood we're going to be that magnanimous to say lay not to sin to the charge well look let those filthy bracket backs have it you dirty so-and-so's God isn't everything in us rising up in the flesh that's normal it's human and so is wanting it back to retaliate let him have it but the last thing he said was lord lay not to sin to their charge and having said that he fell asleep that's the way God describes his death he wasn't killed since God took him he had fulfilled the purpose for which God had given him in the earth and then when i was living in new york i was a missionary to the jews some jewish brothers came to us we've encountered the jbl on the streets today new york city jewish defense league terrorists doing God good by killing us and they said that you're on the hit list dot that you and moishe rosen are ticketed for assassination oh that's it and i i don't know what i said i said to my wife i said you know that i'm i'm ticketed for assassination oh she said don't worry about it God's not finished with you yet i'm not worrying about it they can do nothing against me except to be given from above and it will not be given until i have finished the purpose what until i'm sent which includes speaking to you this morning these words how much more precious will these words be when you will one day and perhaps in much the distant future hear the report of my death at the hands of men vexed by the same spirits of darkness as did in stephen and every think of God in every generation really to punctuate the importance of this work for you you when my earthly course is finished when i run the course that i set before me then i'll fall asleep and not before you know what my privilege is with them who have fallen asleep in the face where Paul says and first just one means a meeting time where he said i'm not happy to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that means to a guide in christ and not of old age or from ulcers or cancer or tumors and the various other consequences of sinful living those that have fallen asleep in obedience to God in in in suffering and in death concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope but we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain just barely survive is what that right fact actually those words actually mean those of us that are barely alive who survived the intense persecution of the church at the end times unto the coming of the lord shall not come before or precede them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of God and the dead in christ shall rise first we have such a privilege such a crown such a reward so heavenly a thing and will be the first to rise and and greet the lord in the air and forever to be with him and to rule and to reign within while others sleep for thousands years who are content with near-sunday christianity all bless the lord saints so what's your choice this morning and how far you want to go you want to be full of the holy ghost and the wisdom and of power you want to have a faith that shines like an angel and will guarantee a reaction against darkness against it you want to be sent by God to such places of concentration to speak such fearful things that men will either fall before you in repentance or mash upon you with their teeth and there'll be no in between you want to be among the persecuted or the persecutors such decisions are needing to be made now how far do we want to go to be full of the holy spirit and be separated from the spiritless world and touch not the unclean thing and he will receive us hallelujah let's bow before stephen's God let's decide something today and transact something today i didn't make up this message was it my choice i thought to speak something else entirely about Israel but i want to tell you the same stuff the issue of martyrdom is the issue of Israel for only a model witness will move my people to jealousy nothing was and indeed to extend mercy to them at the end of the age will require your life precious Jesus thank you lord great martyr witness that you yourself are to call us with the high calling of christ Jesus and lord i think it's in your heart this morning to do something with certain individuals in this room once and for all not with regard to their final moments but all their moments that they can stand before men without fear because they fear you only will speak the words that your spirit puts in their mouth without regard to how it is heard how is it understood how is it received whether it's appreciated liked or not liked settle something today my God with sons and daughters who choose this course who welcome your disciplines who need their air conditioning need their fix need the essential provision which is legitimate to have that is compromising and want today to pull out the plug willing for inconvenience and will not hold their lives as dealing to themselves will love it unto the death things transact something now settle it what this face is and what it's called is because we're only hours removed from the taking away of a veil that has disguised the naked enmity and hatred of the powers that crucify Jesus who have but a short time and will ventilate their full fury on the church and upon the jew in the last days will you be settle it welcome the discipline and the dealings and the trials of God to shape his character in you character in you live by the spirit be full of the spirit the eternal spirit by the power of which Jesus gave himself without spots before death hallelujah call on him let him know what the decision is whatever it takes whatever it takes whatever it takes my God may i look steadfastly up to heaven may be full of the spirit may i always see the heaven is open may i always see Jesus at the right hand of the father may i always recognize that everything is from the government of God from the throne of God in heaven that nothing is circumstantial nothing is haphazard nothing is accidental every suffering as a child is from you for your eternal good for your glory for the praise of your name fill me with that spirit in full abandonment i remove from my body from my mind from my apartment from my dwelling anything that is of the world that makes your spirit to be quenched i don't want to be a groovy believer who is all this in heaven too i want to be radically separated from all that he might have such witnesses on halloween in honolulu a people without fear whose life has already been given up and it hardly matters by what form and at what time the body shall be required hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah let the cloud of witnesses about us my God rejoice for this morning rejoice for the work of your spirit in the world rejoice that a transaction was made this morning that brings us closer to the fulfillment of the end for which they wait near the powers of darkness that grew over honolulu shatter who have had an undisputed sway over this city and over this land to distort to pervert to tempt to intimidate to threaten to have a full day because there has not been in the midst a church of an apostolic kind whom they are required to fear we do not hold their lives with dealing with this lord settle something today for this congregation put something into their foundation that shall never dissipate away let people who have been coming not come again because it's gotten just a little too radical for their taste but let those people remain and abide and add to them such as shall please you to have my God in this sitting in this midst a people for you a witness people for Jesus just play out from your feet make a statement before the witness of men the witness of angels the witness of God the witness of the invisible witnesses and the witness of the principalities and powers who have threatened you intimidated you jerk and manipulated you tempted you break their filthy power by a word out of your mouth that says i will yes lord this call is for me you
