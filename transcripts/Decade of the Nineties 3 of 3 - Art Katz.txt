Decade of the Nineties 3 of 3 - Art Katz

It's the liberty that we have enjoyed in just opening our mouths before you, because more than God's people realize, they're so conditioned the way in which that word proceeds. So that liberty that we enjoyed is a testimony to the maturity that the pastor refers to. Well, it's my privilege to introduce Gary to you, whose greatest commendation is that he's not well-known. I don't know about you, but I have a very strong penchant or disposition for the things that are obscure and hidden and unknown. The choice kinds of things that God sculpts in the hidden place chisels away to fashion and perform the instruments of his use. Gary is such a one. Every time I introduce him, I bring up another aspect of the thing that he is in God. The scripture that's in my heart this evening for Gary is, and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death. As I have never before pondered that, I just realized that all three of these aspects that the identity of the overcoming saint are not independent of the other. We will have no more an appropriation of the blood of the Lamb than we will have of the word of our testimony or our ability not to love our lives unto the death. That somehow they're all integral and related, and we grow up in all three of these things in the same time. So what is the word of your testimony? Do we have a testimony, that is to say, a history in God that has come through the dealings and trials to which he has submitted us, and that we have come through them in a greater apprehension of the knowledge of God and of his love and of the issues of the faith than we had before the trials came? Gary is a man with that kind of history, and to share it with you would be to occupy the rest of the speaking time. I think when he opens his mouth, you'll realize it. I remember once I heard a man of that kind, and we were all so enormously impressed with his teaching, and we were filing our way out of the room, and someone in front of me as we were walking to the exit said, boy, I'd come a long way to hear this man teach again. I said, dear brother, I'd come a long way merely to hear him clear his throat. There's something in the resonance of the voice that bestiques the history of God with men, that ought to as much bless us as the content of the speaking itself. We need to enjoy God's men, especially the ones that are prepared in the hidden place. Well, Gary was called of the Lord. He was very successful in the world, had an own plane car, restaurant business, cattle, all the rest, the kind of guy that was going to be a millionaire before he was 40. When the Lord called, everything was stripped away. Hewn to the bone is the phrase that I like to use, stripped. And then in the hidden place came the dealings of God, and then when some substance of them were fulfilled, the Lord began to bring them forth and brought us into each other's lives. And we've made two trips to Africa, three trips to Africa, and we once made a 4,000 miles or kilometer trip by car visiting the places of Anabaptist persecution and suffering. We are a peculiar twosome, so I don't know what's on his heart tonight, but I know that it is in keeping with what has already been spoken and will bring us to a fit conclusion in the Lord's wisdom and heart of love and intention for us in these days. So I just want to pray again for him and for that speaking and for our own hearts to be prepared to hear and to receive. Don't be afraid to take notes. Very few men have ministered to me as much as Gary or have been used by the Lord in dealing with my life as he. It's been schooled of some very special things that I have never, ever heard expressed by any other man anywhere.

So Lord, we just thank you that you've given gifts to the church, men, sons of God. So Holy Ghost masterpieces, fashioned and formed at your own hand, chiseled, broken down, hewn, sculpted, and we love your handiwork and we appreciate the servant, my God, whom you have formed in the hidden place as a special treat for us. And we ask a grace upon his head and a freedom and ease of spirit, my God, in bearing the burden that you have placed in his heart for us tonight. We just bow now to express appreciation and to thank you for such gifts, my God, and that our esteem might be heightened for all of the servants of God. Bless him now, my God, and bless us through him, we pray, as you bring us to conclusion in these days, having been so wonderfully with us. By your Holy Spirit, we pray and receive the praise, the glory, the honor, the acclaim, and the acknowledgement of your servants. In Jesus' name, we pray, Amen.

We don't have all these fancy things under the trees in Africa. I am really just privileged and so appreciate being here this weekend. I've really been strengthened and encouraged by your pastor, just being with him. And I really want to just begin, and though you don't know me, I detest flattery, but I also know that a lot of times we don't appreciate what we have sometimes until we don't have what we have available. And I don't know if the Lord is going to lead me into sharing some of that, but I really mean that not as flattery, but I've been made aware by the Spirit, just in these hours of being here, of the tremendous investment, not in monetary, physical finances, but the tremendous investment of time that God has made and put in this time, in this body here. And I really believe that that's the reason that Aaron could have the tremendous freedom and liberty and grace upon him to share that word in just total freedom of condemnation, you know, trying to be obtrusive or put something upon us in any way. But out of a heart of love, I really believe that God has been working in us and I know he shares my heart on this. We do not, and are not speaking as though we have arrived, but simply in obedience to God out of the clarity of the hour that we live in and God forbid that his people, that we would ever face these last days in fear because, and I know there's been a lot of about the last days that has created and generated fear, but I really believe that you, you know, have been given a pastor and leaders in this body that has a particular purpose in mind within this part of this nation and all that's going on within the body in this nation to have that kind of leadership and to have that kind of maturity and to have that kind of stability, I just feel impressed to appreciate it very, very much. I really do because I remember I heard Dr. Howard say this and I really agreed with him. He's the gentleman that began the Hustlery of the Christian Education and that was that familiarity diminishes value and that really is true in a foolish child, but in a wise son that grows up and we've just been really privileged to be with Andrew and his parents. Hallelujah, and you see a family raising up a wise son in this congregation, there is nothing that diminishes value more than an overabundance of something that you don't appreciate and this nation is full of that. There's never been a generation with the responsibility that this generation has and there's never been a generation like this generation that has given more privilege and opportunity to prepare for the responsibilities that we face and somehow, somehow in these days God in his great heart is humbling himself and reaching out to his people in a way that it's beyond natural comprehension to see God plead with people just like a natural father, a natural mother would plead with a son to stop and just change and just listen to. The heart of the father, it's like an open heaven has been opened to God's people in a, not in just a laugh, it's then God knows what he's doing when he opens his heart to people and so I really encourage us tonight just in our beginnings tonight and I want to just to go slowly and wisely, but I want you to realize that God by his Spirit is saying if you've ever appreciated the good little things, do it more now than you ever have. That's wisdom because you're living in a generation, you're living in a nation. I was born in this nation and was thrust out into the nations seven or eight years ago and every time I come back I just have a deep sense of a great need for God's people in this nation and especially that the young and I guess all of us at whatever place we're in, we need to really humble ourselves and begin to appreciate the sovereign ways that God has led each one of us and begin to appreciate what God has done in each one of us and it just as Aaron was praying I just begin to break up in a fresh way of my inner man the blessing that it is to be together and to have one another and have the assurance of one another's love and I know that historically God's people have failed in one of two extremes and that is the inability to maintain their life and relationship with him in the extreme abundance or the inability to patiently wait and trust and understand in the extreme times of suffering. One of those two places and God in his great wisdom seems to have a way of leading his true saints in some time of their life into both of those places and I really love him for that and I've buried both of those places with him and I'm thankful tonight that I can be here together with Aaron and the Jews as a congregation and really just begin to to share some of the some of the truths that I believe it's going to take in God's people to endure and overcome to the end because there there is a fantasy in the midst of the nations about the day of the coming of the Lord what that really means and I remember when I was a little little boy that I got a lesson that I didn't understand until I was about almost 50 years old what it really meant and that was my mother had went away and I loved horses and ponies and and I did not like to take naps and and I was put to bed with the full assurance that I was going to stay there and sleep and she went away and and I watched it go out the driveway and ran to the barn and jumped on my pony and and rode out on the hillside and and watched where I was assured that that I could see the dust of that car coming down the road and I would be able to beat her back to the house and jump in bed and pretend that I was sleeping and never know the difference but God really really taught me something that day that I only got three spankings that I ever remember but I didn't need any more than that not because of mighty but I in those days it wasn't there was no such thing as human rights and child abuse and I got the fear of parents thought to me do you believe in that I'm really I really am thankful for a few things that happened in my real real young life in regards to discipline and correction and it really is the the disciplines and the corrections and the and the ultimate anticipation of being able to trust God in his scourging that I love about God and I know that may sound morbid and strange to you but blessings have never really been a concern to me for some reason because as I've read God's Word that's an inevitable thing that has to happen literally you know I said yes last night when Aaron talked about the credit card I said Lord how come I always get blamed for these kind of things but you know I'm I was I was in commercial real estate development and insurance and I may be one of the first persons that ever stood in this pulpit that I've never had a credit card and I remember when I got my first one I had very high credit rating and I had a lot of other money and things and you know God is really about this and I open this letter it just shows you the sovereignty of God and I read that and and it I remember right it was something about being a preferred customer and they didn't even know me from Adams all far I never heard me and I I literally cursed that company I was a carnal man I said I mean really and I went over and I did I got mad because I couldn't care it and I stood in the in the wastebasket I never did they were tell Aaron this even and I twisted on that thing and I threw it in there and I spit on it and I said I'm not your preferred customer you don't ever know me and I never will be I didn't even know what I was doing I mean I really did I didn't have any frame of reference other than as a real little boy my dad who was not a believer he said son when you get older he said get a good little place and get it paid for and don't desire a whole lot other things less than eight years old a carnal man speaking to once to become a son of Israel I could I could share things like this with you all night here I feel very very strange about the day we live in but I feel also very very privileged for the way that God has led because the Lord has blessed I hope it's a blessing my wife and I with a with it it's in a supernatural way with a piece of land that's just a mile and a half away from Aaron and how then and as I've prayed about what he wants me to do first on it you know I had a great revelation he said I want you to build a barn you know I mean I mean really successful ministers today don't go out and build barns you know at least from some of the promotional publications that I've observed in my short time back in this country but I want you to know something saints we really are in the last days and we really are needy especially me and God has opened heaven in a way that really is open if we can see our need and one of the problems is many times is seeing our need being a believer having everything having the securities of all securities the United States and all of this thanks hallelujah father we just thank you for this blessed evening and this blessed people I really thank you for your presence we really need to know how to practically face the reality of the time and the season that we now live in and we just ask you now to release some of those things that you might be glorified in an ongoing way in this body and the leaders of it in Jesus name Amen like us to turn to the gospel of John then been real encouragement to me to see the many great profound Bible scholars and ministers of our day I have come into a great revelation and that revelation is that they need to be looking at the teachings of Jesus I don't want to be cynical but my real question is how come it's taken so long you understand what I mean because you see if they are not primary and foremost within our hearts then they're going to be relegated to being either irrelevant or difficult hard to understand and will go on to something else without a foundation with which we're believing in and I believe one of the securities of in in of enduring and overcoming to the end is found in the gospel of John chapter 5 because as real as Jesus was related to the father and walked with the father and and breathed the life of the father even so that is our privilege and place in preparation for these last days there is no other way of preparation it is not what you know about someone it's who you know personally not because you have to because you're broken in your inner man with the privilege the highest and greatest privilege any human being that's ever ever been born is to be brought to the father himself and introduced to him and and be wise enough to allow himself to father him for the father himself loves us that's not just a teaching or a principle to be implemented to gain something that is a natural result the natural working of a person that walks and abides in the holy spirit the work of the work of the holy spirit beginning with verse 37 he says and the father himself who sent me has testified of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form but you do not have his word abiding in you because whom he sent him you do not believe you search the scriptures for and then you think you have eternal life and these are they which testify of me that you are not willing to come to me that you may have life now verse 41 one of the most powerful in scriptures that we need to let the holy spirit work in us and he makes a statement as the firstborn son for all of God's children thereafter and he says i do not receive honor from men Jesus the father himself through him because he said i speak only those things the father tells me to speak Jesus says i do not receive honor from men and i wonder where the church would be tonight i love your pastor he thinks ahead of time but i i wonder where the church would be tonight if if everyone truly professed to be a believer believed in this one truth about the teachings of christ and especially in the last 25 years and especially in the last 10 years in america i mean are you with me or are are you polluted with the spirit of the world and the God of this age and convinced that you need to be patted on the head and told how great you are every time you empty the wastebasket and every time you forget told you you're still good and right you know God is really God and he really is full of grace but i'll tell you that he's not a jerk to be jerked around and he's not a man to be deceived and the sooner that that we get broken up in our inner man begin to really appreciate who he is i didn't really appreciate him because we see who he is and we acknowledge who we were and what we were and if there was anything good before after christ there's nothing to do with anything of the flesh had nothing to do father mother grandfather grandmother had nothing to do had all to do with one person and that's God Jesus christ who loved us and died for us and rose again and and and truly is a father and says what he means and he means what he says he doesn't want to be uh happen to be argued with or attacked by what he says all the time he you know God is looking for a people that will love him in such a way that just simply loves them and just believes them just believes what he says doesn't need do you know something the majority of what Jesus doesn't need and doesn't if we would obey the things that are clear we would learn so much that all the rest of it would fall into place would need would need any other interpretation see it's not a lot we need things and i tell you why because a little bit of God is more than all of everything else now you need to really get that into your hearts because see we have not been living like we like we really understand or believe that a little bit of God is more than all of everything else that always that has been is and will be manufactured made and brought forth by man you know something i'm just a strange person that believes that i am so free in that i believe that with all of my heart that's how much i think of man and how much i think of God he's everything he really is everything and when we really believe that we desire we desire we desire daily and we listen daily we look into his face we look for for that which pleases him that which satisfies him now i'm not saying that as though i have done that in a perfect way i've skinned my nose up and and had a few scars other parts of me trying that but when he got me he really got all of me and i'm really glad and with Jesus i say to them i do not receive honor receive honor from them and i believe that God says to the church tonight whose honor are you seeking and for what purpose are you living and serving it goes on in verse 42 says but i know you that you do not have the love of God in you says i've come in my father's name and you do not receive me if another comes in his own name him you will receive now listen verse 44 because when this really gets a hold of your gizzard and you start letting it work it uh it really does something it says how can you believe to receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God you know something it's not more faith that we need i want you to know tonight's things that we've got so much faith we are polluted with faith we've got we do we've got so much faith but you see our problem is because of desiring the praise and the honor of man the fear of man and not understanding God's ways we really don't exercise faith in the times and season that we should exercise faith in because we're we're we're seeking honor from man and we've been and we've been many have been trained that way but uh they do good for one purpose and one reason and then when they don't get that then they begin to rebel and when they really get their freedom and their liberty they don't go on doing that they go on doing what everybody else is doing because it's popular and more acceptable so how can you believe who receive honor from one another i already know in the spirit that that some of you are grinding your gears but i want you to know something that we're living in the strangest time that historically in the nation since at any of any time nobody's ever been this way before you know something there you can't go across the ocean you can't go and put in a video you can't put on a tape you can't read a book there's only one inspired book that you can read to equip and prepare you for these last days and if you don't remember lots why and if you if your frame of reference is whatever thing is behind you and whatever anyone that you think has gone on before has been successful in it's going to equip you and prepare you for for this hour and this day that lies ahead you might be deceived just like lot's wife was when she looked back but God is saying to the church today that if you humble yourself in all of your weakness and all your frailty and all of your sensualities and lust and greed and comfortable convenient ways that you desire if you humble yourself and you begin looking at me as God and father and and and look at that love and the truth of my love because see when you do that it breaks your heart it's not more faith we need saints it's a pure release of the spirit of the fear of the lord it's all we need tonight to do all that God wants us to do because to every man has been given a measure of faith and you see it's amazing what our capabilities are in in in achievement in in doing it for a wrong motive see the reason i know is because you know if a if a real estate deal if i was going to get a hundred thousand dollar commission on a real estate deal you you would be amazed at how patient i could be you understand it's amazing the depth of character and stamina and power that we have to to get to be known or to get to get well you're not a bunch of just little sleazy weaklings that aren't capable of anything and the problem is he just don't fear God in a way that will will let God be God because i say it's okay i know i'm speaking from my spirit and the word and experience tonight i i got enough a frame of reference as i've said many times in these last several weeks and months there's a few the rest of you out there that's got a few gray hairs too if you if you'll get wives tonight and and not think that the depression years were so dark and and terrible and whatever wherever else you went through that you think was bad and really get hold of reality you know i can remember in this nation when heathen when heathen i mean real heathen and represented what i have watched for 20 years among spirit-filled places it's been now millions of dollars in teaching after teaching after teaching after teaching to be literally there was a natural friendliness there was a natural neighborliness that was given to one another just by virtue of need i mean there was no no biblical orientation for them there was just a an earthly wisdom in common since and God is is imparting a wisdom into the church today that is the pure wisdom of God that wisdom that comes from above contrary to this wisdom that is now that that much is functioning with it's contrary naturally to demonic wisdom but human wisdom can so produce the things that look like God and and and and imitate that so closely because today we have no frame of reference for God in his mercy is going to do something suddenly and one of the sudden things is is the is the purity of the spirit of the fit of the lord is going to be released within the church and the faith and the measure of faith that each one of us have will we will begin to exercise it in a natural supernatural way not to get but simply to be and to glorify you see there's only one purpose for being and that is if we're truly an obedient family of God obedient family of God and that that there's only one motivation that that will will cause us to stay upright and maintain our bearings and and come into a safe landing in these last days through through the darkest historic darkest period in all history and that that is when the fear of the lord is working and cleansing in a conscious way it will cause us to exercise faith in the reality that the father truly does love us no matter what it acts like looks like and feels like and feels like and many have lost their bearings and and and and many sit and are still trying to be counseled and brought out of hurt and things that God intended to be a blessing in their life and i really encourage us tonight to realize something that that God had a lot of confidence in himself even with abraham and joseph and david and some of the patriarchs you know i know i i read nothing in the new or the old testament that the devil treated joseph so shamefully to you i mean that terrible being before the cross see before the cross God set a pattern for life and we have a problem today we we've put ourselves above the minister and the patriarchs the holy and Godly men and women of old they learned obedience by the things they suffered and Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered and the the the the the blessed and wonderful privilege of suffering in just in this generation has been talked away and peeled away and shot away and counseled away and tried to be intimidated away today but i really believe that God is sovereign in every one of our lives and had a purpose in every situation that we've been involved in from the time of our mother's womb and if you really wanted to hear a sob story that would make some of you really turn on your self-pity and in human sympathy i could tell you if i really waxed eloquent tonight and i could tell you a story about my own life that would it wouldn't have to go to the beauty parlor to get your hair curled i'm serious you see we have a problem in it and that's that we seek honor from from man and we don't fear God you're looking at me really strangely say where is he going with this issue i believe God is is going right to the heart of the issue because i want you to know something that you and i do not have another 10 years i'd like us to say out loud this out loud and and so that it doesn't put you in bondage in it you don't have to agree with it really but i would just like to hear i would like the heavenlies to hear us and i'm i'm in the new king james translation in verse 41 i do not receive honor from men other you know don't it won't hurt you if you know and i'm not putting you in in bondage or anything so just say it out loud with me i do not receive honor from men now a more honest testimony with would be i want to get to where huh i want you to know something God is not enormous to condemn us things but i just know that this dark evil system that is in society today and and all of a sudden society is a society of sports and entertainment and recreation and vacation and holiday and hobby orientation that is the orientation of this society today and men work to get they do not work to produce and to glorify their father for the pleasure of it i remember another word of wisdom my old daddy gave me he said son you never have to worry about a job he says whenever you go out to get a job instead of and we were and there wasn't any in those days he said always always work for someone always do something and he said a lot of times it'll be for nothing but he said always be willing to do that and he says i guarantee you you'll always have a job that that was my social security program when i left home and you know i really believed that i left i went when i was 13 years old and and i didn't nobody felt sorry for me because i didn't have a car and a and a nice apartment in bed to sleep in but my my dad he offered to borrow to loan me five dollars and he let me know that that i better pay him back as soon as i could and i slept in a straw stack and picked strawberries and ate strawberries and what i did to eat i got paid for that was my beginnings the first thing i did with my first five dollars i sent them back to my dad i'm really glad i did that i was scared of it i never realized how good he was to me hallelujah you see God was in him we've got lots to be thankful for saints if we get and let God come and get his toolbox out and screw our heads off and re-thread them and screw them back on right and begin to appreciate the truth of his word and appreciate the sufferings and the sacrifices of life because you see the majority of suffering that everybody's gone through this 40 years and and under today the majority in this nation generally speaking has not been for righteousness it's been because of their pride and they talk about it as though it was suffering they talk about it because they're deceived they're not in the light didn't realize that God must have them and had a purpose and had something to teach them and learn although i'll tell you something saints it's not going to take God very long to get the job done you know you ever notice something and when it's really hot it doesn't take long to get sunburned aren't you know something God is is stoking the fire up and we're going to get a lot of opportunity to exercise our faith in the teachings of Jesus we really are you know i'm so foolish to believe this and because of the foolishness of believing this i just want to share several instances about this to to help you to encourage you to get into the teachings of christ because it's one thing to know about that you should do that and to always go around wishing that you would have done that after you've had the opportunity to do it and you didn't it's another thing to do it at the time you got the opportunity and learn the lesson because it'll never happen again just that way and i remember after 16 of our family in zimbabwe were martyred and and a man that i had saved his life literally in his family and and i really love this man and i still love this man and i know that it's not me as a person but it's just God in me uh because God just loves and keeps on loving him it's a strange thing uh in it and uh i came back to zimbabwe i was gone for a little bit and i came back and he had betrayed me and turned me into the police and and all kinds of stories were going and everybody was uptight and angry and uh so i said well let's call the police out and have a meeting so i decided to have the meeting in the chapel and so the officer in charge and we were all around there and so just as the meeting began the lord spoke to my heart that i should wash wash his feet i mean this was just a little bit after after 16 of our family had gone just weeks and uh and i said lord if i don't do this with real compassion then it's then i'm going to do something just to influence this man to get out of trouble and i just began to weep and just a compassion i really i wanted to wash his feet and so we got a pan and a towel and i got down on my knees and began to wash his feet and and he really wasn't affected too much and this officer in charge was there and if you knew the culture and everything i mean this was this was a calculated risk of being just exactly what the likes blacks like to do with the whites to in the antagonism between the blacks and the whites just so you know brothers that are black here i'm not a racist i i just know what goes on in between races whether we're we're jew gentile black white red or yellow and so i washed his feet and and we got through the meeting and a real spirit of counsel came upon this officer in charge and and after after that happened we were driving along with this officer so this officer in charge said you know he says God sent me here and i said really he said yeah i said i'm a spirit-filled believer i was sent here from harare to watch you and to see whether you was really real or not and he said uh you know my granddad walked from here all the way down to south africa many years ago just to get water baptized and uh he said the first white men that came to this country pitched their tent in my grandfather's crawl and he got saved and my daddy got saved and he got saved and but he said you know he said you're the first white man that i ever seen do this in such a time as this he says now i know that God sent me here he says i'm here to help you fulfill the purpose that God had these 16 people give their lives for well that was an encouragement to this little fella in such a time as that you know it really works things and was privileged to be in the hut of three of the people that were in prison for almost seven months and then let loose on amnesty that did this to our family and privilege to preach the truth to them and see them make a confession of faith you know the gospel is not all what the present day interesting and exciting promotions magazines are putting it out to be that really does require something for the grace that's given and there's a lost dying world that's looking for somebody to hate and if you believe in the teachings of christ you're a good candidate you'll be hated by the world by those that profess that by the world by those that profess that they are his but are not it has to happen because Jesus said that's the way it was and it's not always interesting and it's not always easy it's not always comfortable and it's not always convenient but here now what what it is always is always very very rewarding if you believe in eternity and heavenly rewards to seek the honor that comes only from God and to be known by God the father to be known by him so that he we know that voice and we experience his presence in the times of darkness and rejection and and and loss and betrayal and and and we're not in a in a tailspin or a nosedive and out of control because of the devil and all of his cohorts but we can patiently in a holy way wait for the presence of God to come and save us and if he saves us we're saved if he doesn't we got no way out we got no we've we've lost all of our professional promotional expertise and all we got is that little God called Jesus who is more than all of everything else do you really believe that tonight if we really believe that tonight will be radically different tomorrow we really will you know there was a time in history when people sold themselves as slaves to take the gospel in obedience to the voice that they had to their heart personally and when they got they did when they got where they were going they didn't have any insurance of anything from where they went there was no telephone there was no there was no telex there was no banking system i wonder how they survived they survived just like we're going to survive in the last days God in his mercy is calling a people and i believe that God has systematically and patiently invested in this body something that he's going to begin to suddenly require a lot more of suddenly he's going to begin to require it required if we've learned our lessons well and really believe what we say we believe there won't be any problems if we haven't there's going to be problems and a lot of them and i'd like you to turn with me to the scripture that is on the memorial of the martyrs and i believe it's one of the deepest and profoundest of all scriptures and i know that's maybe not wise to say that but i just feel impressed to say that because i believe that all of the truth proverbs 22 i believe all of the truth that there is to be learned in the new covenant in the new covenant see certain truths are all wrapped up in one little truth and if that truth is yielded to in a childlike faith in a consistent way all of a sudden a root system begins to develop and go deep in the heart of God and and and you know to get a seed certain seeds to sprout i was a hard seed to sprout i tell you but uh yeah i've got the job done in this scripture lies a key by humility for sorry proverbs 22 for by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honor and life now i want you to know something in a very single minded way there is no other way none the whole world lives under grace but if you want the divine influence of the father in your life you under and meditate on this truth until you have the light in the life of it and when you have the light in the life of it it will and it will cause you to stand says the lord and endure and overcome even under the end this is this everything is in that one verse that one verse the problem is we have been trained and exposed to professional humility rather than unobtrusive humility and there's a difference and if you're a wise congregation if you're a wise person if you're a wise family you'll ask God to show you the difference between professional humility and unobtrusive humility because there is a difference is there a difference between day and night see there's a little bit of light at night sometimes but there's there's a great difference and to understand this truth and this was the truth that God began to give us us that caused a small group of people and those of us that survived to to be able to come through what God wanted us to come through in and we can talk about grace it's another thing to experience grace we can talk about it's really not so important and necessary to get prepared for any kind of sudden whatever might happen in the future because when that happens at that time all of a sudden God is just going to give us a lot more grace and then and then everything will be all right i says is it working for you under pressure under pressure loss rejection and betrayal today if it is your philosophy will work if it isn't you're deceived God freely gives to the humble and God-fearing you see the whole world lives under grace even the unbelievers live under grace and our problem is we're living a kind of a life that's a little bit better than them and an added problem often in the way we're living in that we're actually proud that we're a little bit better than them as though it was us and not him in our forgetfulness come on you know the more honest that we can get with God and ourselves the more God can be God in our lives there's a clear pattern in history and in christian history those that believed in the teachings of christ and and believed in unobtrusive humility in the fear of the lord they endured and overcome every suffering and every persecution every form of doctors that God took them through so i'll tell you something God's taken through some so those that didn't join the crowd became murderers and i don't know what happened to but i don't have a lot of confidence according to the last book of revelation in liars and murders and thieves and cowards and the deltas and everything else that he names there i really believe he really means all those things not because he's wrong but because he loves us so much and he forewarned us of it something happens something happens each step of the way in life when we have the courage and the wisdom to humble ourselves and yield our spirit soul and body to the situation that exists according to the teachings of christ something happens in that time now once you do know something that if it's a week later a day later two months later you can get something out of realizing it and repenting but you can't get what you would have gotten at that moment of time impossible all creation teaches us and shows us that and God is wanting to come and prove the church and develop a root system to prepare for these last days because the determining factor of life is in the root all right hallelujah another thing that i really would like to to leave with us tonight i believe by the spirit is an understanding of the holiness of waiting we've sung our courses we've quoted our scriptures about mounting up and we've exercised the word of our testimony in it but but but all too often we've been victims of either victims of circumstances ignorant or something and we've had our egg cracked in our cocoon cut all by ambitious persons ambitious persons you know what it means to have your egg cracked in your cocoon cut is there anyone here that doesn't know what that means why is why is people you see God really is a God of life and death and to not understand the holiness of waiting and i want to read you something that really touched my heart deep about because as you can see i just we're we're just in a in a place with God tonight where God is is is in the midst sovereignly doing something not from personal ministry but from faithfulness of gathering together for two strange persons coming there's many things i want to would like to read or say about this but i want you i just feel the spirit wants this one thing about waiting when i had my own airplane you know when you fly you they put you in a place holding pattern waiting and God is a wonderful God and when i see what's going on today i just say God you're really you're going to get your that the tank of mercy is really going to get drained out of what's going on right now i can tell you it really is but this is the this is this is just one thing about waiting one place in life and andrew you know i really trust that you and all the rest of the children and i those parents that got your children here with you tonight is what i stop right here and say i really respect you i really do you know when moses took care of everybody took care of everybody at one time he didn't have a one kind of sweetener for this and the one time flavor for that i mean moses fed them all manner and i really respect parents that have the courage to have their children with them and live the life when they get home but to wait is to remain temporarily neglected or unrealized in a right attitude you know something all root growth stopped when there's not thanksgiving in our heart for the situation that we find ourselves in all roots grow all your spiritual roots stop growing when there's not thanksgiving in the heart then i play games with the living God of Israel and his great mercy and grace but when when we begin and i'm not talking about exercising a principle now get out of trouble or to get what you want because that really goes on a lot you know are you aware how much that goes on come on are you really aware really does but i want you to know something you're not fooling our father and i say he's got a bigger waiter than you have and your whiner isn't as big as his waiter i'll tell you that and wisdom says that when we humble ourselves and begin to realize that the devil is not sovereign and the devil is not orchestrating things but we have a loving father that really wants to to get a root system in us that that we can bear fruit upwards and we we we really get back on course always remember this some of you are going to tell me someday if you ever see me get always remember this to get back on course is to get humble and thankful that's what it means to find your bearings and get back on course doesn't mean a lot of light but you get enough courage because God gives what his influence to the humble he freely gives it it's a guaranteed result you can't can't help but happen it has to happen it's not a manipulation it's the way God is that's why humble God fearing quote unquote if there is such a thing heathen are always blessed ultimately i love his word and i love his sovereignty to get back on course is to humble ourselves and be thankful and find the purpose and the reason that our heavenly father is in our life in this situation and i will one of my great regrets since i've walked with God my the only regrets as near as i can tell if i didn't i didn't realize this more and do this more quicker in every situation that's happened to me since i become a believer and not to get out of trouble but to realize that God is developing a root system for a time in a season yet to come the presence of God under pressure is proof of the power we possess in purity and in patience we are kept called to be peacemakers do you know when you get your grades under pressure that's where we get our grades thanks we don't get our grades because we've done it right now in in a hothouse setting hothouse setting you say is that important to do it right there absolutely but the father has a place to test it i love my father here's nothing there you're not going to get away with anything and i'm really glad about that because you see the reason God tries our faith every new step see this body this congregation is in not just separately here but that we really have entered the whole whole nations have entered into a new phase a new place and God is expecting something but when God tests our face and every new step it's not to find out if we got faith to find out if we fear God are you aware of that tonight you see if you and i really realize that we wouldn't we wouldn't you know go away disgusted and try to conjure up and figure out that we missed God because we didn't have faith and i and i'd like to turn back and really look at that because you see when we have courage enough to wait on God that he's doing something and he's going to raise up genesis 22 we we don't have time and God doesn't want to develop this but it's a it's a precious place in God that God has brought us to and genesis 22 beginning with verse 11 says but the angel the lord called to him abraham from heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here i am i bet isaac was glad that abraham wasn't dead and he said do not lay your hand on the land or do anything to him for i know that you are the great man of faith and power and i can entrust you to the world leadership conference that's going to take place soon and you're so full of faith that i can cut a covenant with you and reveal all these things and make you a blessing to many nations what does is there any translation in the midst of God tonight that that says now abraham now i know you're a man of great faith is there any translation huh you know something when we understand this when we realize this it's amazing how fast we'll get out of foolishness into wisdom i'll never forget one time when when my earthly dad taught me a an extremely important lesson and i never really learned it but i i didn't forget for many many years but he he took me to such an extreme that i remembered something for quite a little while quite a little while and God had worked on abraham and God knew something that to every man is given a measure of faith he knew that this man this man abraham was going to be identified as the father of faith and that he would exercise the measure that was given to him if he feared God and he and he took him every step of the way and in the final and end result he said now i know that you fear me aren't you glad tonight that faith is not the issue that that fear is i am i really am faith comes by hearing i realize that i realize gifts of faith and all that but that's not this same thing as this talking about now life in relationship with the father that which will cause us to be assured of his love and endure and overcome to the end because for you to fear God in such a way that you exercise faith in the time of darkness in the time of loss rejection and betrayal you have the courage and the confidence in God to not be whimpering and whining but to humble yourself in faith and exercise faith in that place of darkness if you don't believe there's ever a darkness don't turn there with isaiah 50 verses 10 and 11 is a very clear prescription for that because God leads us in those places God not the devil God leads us okay and it's a wonderful and good place to find out if we really fear God and i want to pray for us tonight that this truth would be this would somehow be released that that that there could be tonight a choosing of the fear of the lord and and a an appetite restored or an appetite generated or an appetite released in this body in this place that would have a a desire to understand and and to have and to possess the fear of the lord you want to be sanctified have the fear of the lord psalm 1990 the fear of the lord is clean going to clean the heart fear of the lord it's amazing the the the power in in this agent of the holy spirit so father we humble ourselves right now now and even as that gypsy prophesied to me in romania i realize even right now father that really is a big thing that's in my heart that i'm asking of you but i thank you that big things to us is just a little thing to you who is more than all of everything else us but i'm asking you tonight father in the loving and gentle and kind and yet radical and ruthless ways of of your holy heart you would create in a natural supernatural way in the heart of every hearing ear a natural God given appetite hunger thirst and desire for the spirit of the fear of the lord to have a primary place in their hearts on a daily basis father i pray tonight that they can there can be a choosing even in the night hours of this night but they would be a laying hold of the holy one of Israel that they would have a delight and what the master delighted in the fear of the lord and father we thank you that the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride arrogance a throwward mouth in the evil way lord it's not just a definition to be learned or a principle to be exercised but it's a life to be lived father we pray that the spirit would be relieved now in all of our weakness all our frailty and all of our inadequacies father God that that the purpose is that you so blessed us to hear through erin in in in having a proper understanding of of these last days and a proper understanding of of the coming of the lord and and a proper understanding of being prepared father i thank you tonight that the fear of the lord brings us very close to having a an insurance policy with a premium paid up hallelujah and father if you would grant that grace tonight it would be so meaningful the father we believe that it's in your heart to do that therefore we ask father we thank you for the privilege to to pray this prayer not only from a from a doctrinal position but from a life of experience it has proved to be successful in having the assurance day by day of your love and your confidence in our life father i don't know how you want to do this i simply ask you to do it and take authority over the principalities and the powers of darkness every religious spirit God every intimidating and frustrating spirit every religious spirit that would hinder this holy and divine and eternal truth that has been talked about talked about talked about but not experienced in divine living reality lord we see these children you see this body of believers and they've got a skill and God if these children could see pastors and elders and deacons and fathers and mothers truly fearing God free from hypocrisy deceit and fantasy walking circumspect sober and serious in the joy and peace of the lord father we thank you that's not just a high intellectual religious ideal that's a normal child's portion of life in the grace of God and it's our portion to prepare us and these last days that we speak release of it tonight in Jesus name father we speak relief to those that that that haven't understood the important and the deliberate intentional intentions of God about the fear of God father we lift ourselves anyone that come out of comes out of catholic or protestant or any other wrong teaching of teachings about the spirit of the lord father we thank you God in the in the word of God it teaches not only is it to reverence and to to revere God it's the fear and tumble in the belly right down in the old gut and lord those two together give a complete defined revelation of the truth of the spirit of the lord we speak relief tonight into this body of a freedom to believe the truth and the whole truth about the truth and to experience the freedom of this wonderful gift and the power of its cleansing and the and the encouragement of the exercising of faith even in the middle things when they go home and wish that they would have testified or said something to someone or or better yet when the father of the mother will wish they would have kept their mouth shut instead of starting off in front of one another and the children i'll tell you something father i know that your fear will cause our homes to become so holy will cause our tongues to be sanctified and set apart under you and father i want you to know we've been we've come short of the glory of God and i know that i have father but i thank you tonight you will not allow me to stop preach praying and prophesying of him and God i know the trials that it takes me through and the intimidating times and all of that but i thank you father that you're going to do it and it's going to be perfect as you're perfect and holy as you're holy and it's the fear of the lord that's going to do it because you've already given a measure of faith you've already given of your spirit God there's enough to turn the world upside down and father we are not in that place father we don't need more seminars teaching and training we need a honest heaven-sent holy ghost release of the spirit of the fear of the lord in Jesus name and i resist every lying demon on this truth tonight in Jesus name and we truly ask your forgiveness for our forefathers father who have who have negated this truth or have treated this truth only in reverence only in reverence i'll tell you a little baby can't reverence his mom and dad but i'll tell you can sure learn to respect him in a hurry and father i pray tonight that you would do something that has a depth and a content God it will shake this nation from this even this congregation this place it can do it if the authentic and genuine versus the knowledge about it and the hypocrisy of knowing and not doing about it but the purity of the spirit of the lord being released
