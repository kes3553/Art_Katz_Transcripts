Becoming a Prophetic Church 3 Israel the Suffering Servant - Part 2 - Art Katz

Only the righteous are willing to suffer for another people while they're yet in the place of sin and degradation because however the least they are, they are the least of these my brethren and they're also your brethren if you could but understand. Can you see how many purposes are served by the suffering of Israel in the last days that will identify who in fact the true church is and reveal to the nations who the true God is and reveal to Israel the Messiah whose sacrifice they had previously spurned and now receive with gratitude for he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we are healed.

We need to pray saints.

Lord, a post message blessing we're asking that this long dissertation will not fall on deaf ears either here or through here to the many places in which these tapes or videos will be communicated. That there'll be an apprehension of a new kind of the depth of the meaning of God through judgment of Jesus at the cross of the Holocaust of the Jew and the Holocaust yet to come. That the issues of eternity and the issues of the rule of God out of Zion which is righteousness in the earth is of such a kind, such a nature that it deserves and justifies every expenditure required to obtain it even in the suffering of your people Israel as in the suffering of your son before them for they are also your son and cannot be exonerated or absolved from the road to Calvary that he himself trod. And if it's required of that Israel to what degree shall it be required of us?

Is there a road for us? Is there a Calvary for us? Is there a suffering for us?

Probably to the degree in which we identify with that people and join with them and are caught in the act of it will suffer with them and for them and because of them. For those who hate that people of God will hate this people and we're willing for those last days sufferings by which we ourselves shall be exalted. They to their place in the earth and we to our place in the heavenlies rising and ascending and descending upon the son of man ruling over five cities and some over 10 and the theocratic rule in which we participate from the heavenly locus as they from the earthly.

Whew, what are you saying cats? Much learning has made you mad.

Lord, thank you for recording that little tidbit and let your church dwell upon it. Its own eternal as well as millennial destiny in keeping with the theocratic rule for which we ourselves are being prepared as they are being prepared from the earthly plateau and we from the heavenly and the entrance into which is suffering that is received with gratitude as coming from the hand of God in his great sovereignty and wisdom and necessity that precedes the glory.

Bless the church Lord.

This is the kind of word that not only wakes it up but makes it up and brings it in a hearing into a place of maturity by the very word that only you can convey and perform. So save us my God from being human all to human, American all to human, shallow all to shallow. Bring us my God into that continuum with the great saints that have preceded us who are not complete without us and in our obedience and suffering even unto death the whole remarkable redemptive heilsgeschichte of God, the German word for the salvation history shall be completed to the eternal praise of your glory from one shore to the other throughout all nations and over the face of this earth.

What a calling.

To make that calling a predictable church of Sunday services or programs for our enjoyment is a caricature of the intention of God in those things that pertain to his glory which we reduce and fit to our purpose in keeping with our Kansas City culture and its requirement.

God forbid that travesty my God.

Raise us up to apostolic and prophetic stature who receive a calling with joy and for the God who will give us every enablement so to fulfill it for Israel's sake and your sake in Jesus name we pray, amen.
