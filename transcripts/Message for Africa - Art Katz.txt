Message for Africa - Art Katz

But my subject tonight is not Israel, it's Africa. And there are occasionally times when a word has to be spoken that is not addressed to the congregation.

It's hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken.

Can you understand mystery like that?

That there's a time that has come in the wisdom of God in which something has to be spoken into the earth, into the air.

It's not intended for men, not to say that there's no benefit for it, but it's a declaration, something that must come in point of time. And I am called to deliver it.

So be patient with what you hear, count yourself privileged for an historic moment whose time has come and that you are there to hear it and to draw out God's heart that it might receive a full expression.

Can you understand that? Okay, let's pray for this.

We're privileged to be together for such a moment whose time has come in this Cameroon, in this city, in this Africa. Lord, we invite you to open your heart and send a word into the earth from the throne of heaven that shall not return to you void, but accomplish every purpose for which it has been sent.

Bless your own soul. Gratify your own heart. Fulfill your own purpose.

And we thank you and give you praise that you have a word for Africa, that this continent is upon your heart, that you have an intention for it, which we invite you to perform by commencing with this word and by it setting in motion those things that will bring it to pass, not for our convenience, but the everlasting praise of your glory.

In Jesus' name we pray. God's people said Amen.

The Lord woke me up a few days ago in the early morning hours and flooded me with some thoughts and I thought I had better write them down.

So this is that writing that I'll share just as it was given.

It begins with a scripture that is familiar out of the book of Proverbs Chapter 14, Verse 34 Righteousness exalts a nation.

How I wish you would take that into your deepest heart. The word exalt means also to prosper.

God will prosper a nation that seeks righteousness because it pleases him. He's the God of righteousness. And what distinguished Jesus as a son is that he loved righteousness and hated iniquity.

The two things go together. You can't have the love for the one unless you hate the other.

This distinguished Jesus, it was the hallmark of his sonship for which reason the Father gave him an anointing above his brethren of gladness for that distinction.

So let me ask you. You needn't answer. It's a rhetorical question.

Do you esteem righteousness?

Love it. Enjoy the word. When you speak it and the occasions have been much too rare, the juice begins to run in your mouth.

And because you're becoming a son and a daughter, you recognize that there are daily occasions for righteousness, for the neglect of it, even in the small things and in the everyday things. The issue of righteousness should ever be before us as the church because the church is intended as already the leaven of a kingdom to come, a certain presence within society of a moral kind.

Do you like that word? Morally.

The two words, righteousness and moral, go together. These words need to become dear to us, into our thought and into our consideration. Because if we will not be that presence, if we will not exert and express a moral influence in our African society, from where shall it come? What is moral is to insist upon the dignity of what is made in God's image.

And not to go along with conditions that degrade men. And not to go along to condescend to conditions that degrade men, brutalize men and rob them of their essential humanity.

This is the devil's business to deform and to assault what is in the image of God.

Look what they did to Jesus on the cross. He was so brutalized that he had no beauty that any should desire him. He was marked more than any man.

The devil hates God and hates God's image in men. And we the Church have an obligation to stand for what God has created in his image.

So just in the trip coming here tonight, just the trip coming here tonight, we had to pass through your typical traffic. Of course you have lived with it so long, it's for you normal. I want to tell you, I'm not speaking from the perspective of a white man from America. I'm speaking from the perspective of a prophetic man from heaven. Your traffic conditions are immoral, they're degrading. To fight the position one car etching the other they'll see smoke. That's what a bumper takes so much time to pass through an intersection for the want of a simple traffic light and the respectful order that the traffic light represents.

So that men can move in order to waste their time without competing and striving because that's contrary to God's image in men.

You may think I'm picking on some absurd issue and you can find examples much worse than what I'm describing. But such conditions should not be tolerated.

They need to be opposed by the church that stands for God, stands for righteousness, stands for what is tomorrow and for men in God's image.

It's a remarkable grace to be able to preach having passed through that traffic congestion and just sitting in the back seat. If I had been driving, I would have been immobilized.

How does one become spiritual with the word of the Lord after you have been fighting your way to conditions like that?

And those conditions can be remedied. Those conditions can be altered when the church makes it an issue and expresses its concern as it ought to establish a traffic light that obliges men to observe the structures of law and order for their benefit.

Oh, you dear children, don't you understand there's a struggle between darkness and light that's taking place in the earth. And the powers of darkness, the principalities and powers of the air want to prevail in the world.

And they are unchallenged. And they run the show. And they stand for chaos and destruction.

God stands for light and righteousness. And says, His Kingdom come and earth as it is in heaven. Order is intrinsic to the nature of God. And we need to respect it, to desire it, to see that it functions and that men do not circumvent it because they have money or because they can bribe their way.

All men should stand equal before the law and order.

It is a fundamental, foundational necessity for the integrity appropriate to human life.

Somebody needs to go to the legislature who are indifferent to this condition because they don't have to face it daily. They are living in very elect suburbs with beautiful palatial residences and chauffeur driven cars. They don't have to fight these conditions. They are living in a place of unreality. And they are not at all affected by what is degrading men in this city every day. So would it be improper for a committee from the church or committee of concerned Christians representing a network of churches who have collected tens of thousands of signatures and to go to the legislature and present it as a moral requirement to establish a traffic light at critical intersections because it is righteous. Amen. Well, I know that you are not accustomed to thinking like this or acting like this because it is not spiritual.

And we are not concerned with the world and only with spiritual things.

You are doing God this service not to recognize that this is a spiritual issue.

Because there is a moral question here that affects the whole character of life in Africa and degrades men rather than exalts men in God's image.

If you are going to have moral concern you are going to be required to have political expression. And what begins with a traffic light needs not end there. This is more than just an improvement.

Although it will be an improvement there will be this is the issue of structure and of order that dignifies human life and gives men a better sense of themselves and a respect and esteem for their own humanity that pleases God.

The powers of the air will be terrified if the church begins to think like this and acts like this.

Because when you begin to install order the powers of darkness and chaos will be set aside.

You are making a statement of a kingdom kind of a Godly kind that breaks their influence. And if you keep it up they will be required to release their captives.

So they prefer that you remain passive and live with these conditions after all they have gone on so long after all they have gone on so long and we have gotten used to it and have learned to live with it is not a reason to continue it because righteousness exalts a nation. God will be blessed by the traffic lights by the sense of order something will come into the atmosphere of a city that has taken the pains in the expense to establish these elementary considerations appropriate to human beings in God's image. I was brooding over the issue of Africa coming here from Australia this is my sixth country in six days and tomorrow we will be in Burkina Faso I said Lord what is the word for Africa? I have been in it many times the poverty the disease the lack of employment low level of education what was the answer for Africa Lord? And I believe he is saying in my heart the gospel is the answer the gospel will save Africa not just in terms of salvation from sin but in the elevation of the life of the people because God has been brought into their consideration and he is the God of order and they reflect that God the church has got to live by its faith that's not the requirement for the church elsewhere in the world we Americans can say the just shall live by their faith but we have other sources and other securities but in Africa the issue is faith if God says seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all things else will be added up to you can you believe that? not just for yourself but for the continent God has established Africa to demonstrate God and his reality and the truth of his word the faithfulness of his promises because if your prosperity is not going to come from overseas gifts of charity or technology as other nations your living conditions should improve the world would look on the world would observe what's happened here? the quality of life in Africa is rising the standard of living people don't have to carry merchandise all day on their heads there's improvements and benefits that has not come from natural means but from God who exalts righteousness he will improve the economy and the increase of harvest because that's what his word says righteousness exalts a nation it will prosper it where did the Lord give you this message brother? in Africa Tanzania when I spoke out in an open field of the first African convert, the Ethiopian eunuch and so many came up to me when it was over he said I would love for you to speak to my employer gladly I said who is she? she's the head of the supreme court and the department of justice in Tanzania the next morning I was there and as I came to her door and under her portal the Lord said righteousness exalts a nation and sin is a shame for any people and I came into her house a white man, stranger, a Jew and I said your country is suffering from drought and corruption and violence because you have not been righteous you have become an independent nation you're no longer colonial and you began to usurp and to possess properties owned by white people without fair compensation that is not righteous and therefore you're suffering God's judgment he's kept back the rain he's allowed bribery and corruption to increase violence all of the kinds of things that he would control or eliminate if you practiced righteousness as a nation she called down all of her house servants and her whole family and she had me anoint and pray for and bless every single member when I came back the next time to Tanzania I visited her again she had left office because she could no longer continue to be part of the conduct of a nation that was not righteous listen you dear saints we have got to live from every word that proceeds from the mouth of God if he says that he will exalt a nation that seeks righteousness let's do it if he says seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all things else will be added up to you let's do it and see if God will not add and see if God will not add according to his word if God be not God and his word is not true then what are we doing here and what is this prayer for Africans if we are not taking God seriously in a way that touched his word that is promised that we should live by it and believe in it and see the increase not just in spiritual things but in things of life because he is concerned for us our bodies as well as our souls no other continent in the world has as much opportunity to show forth God as God and the truth of his word and the big words of his promise than this Africa that you are calling to glorify God by proving him Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil so we need to see the realization of that defeat to show the powers of darkness we know that they are defeated we will not be intimidated by them or jerked or manipulated or live according to their wisdom but according to the wisdom of God which defeated them at the cross not by aggressive visual violence but by humility and meekness you are called to be a servant of servants that is not a belittling call that is an ultimate call yes I know you have been servants you have been forced to be servants but to be servants freely and voluntarily not begrudgingly to show forth the nature of God who himself is a servant and wash the feet of his disciples not just as a momentary act but as a revelation of the truth of his condition because that is what God is as God he is a servant and you are called to be a servant of servants the world will be blessed by you when you'll recognize your calling and receive it with gratitude and fulfill it with humility you'll be an example to all nations God will honor the society who honors him by seeking righteousness he will do what men cannot do he'll lift disease and poverty he'll reconcile tribal enmity and differences if we honor his word to perform it the church in Africa needs to demonstrate the radical truth of God's admonitions to seek first the Kingdom of Heaven and his righteousness and all things will be added it needs to demonstrate that not just verbally but in its own life and practice can you imagine such a church the presence of God that will inhabit it that we don't have to stimulate by our own choruses his presence will melt us because he will honor those who are honoring him and have dealt with the issue of righteousness in their own life because we're in something together we're in something together and God will honor by his presence a church that takes his word seriously so as to perform it not only in the great things but in the little children in relationship to their parents wives to their husbands husbands to their wives the church to its membership there are many issues you will not have to look far to find them in which decisions and choices have to be made and we will not have to look far to find them for or against God in little things God has so constituted Africa for this very demonstration that the world will be required to observe the reality of God in Christ by that visible rise of living conditions not obtained by technology or by charity but supernaturally given by God in this requirement to honor his own word that when he sees righteousness that when he sees righteousness he will exalt that nation he will exalt that congregation he will exalt that ministry he will exalt that continent you dear children we have lived for 31 years in North America as a community of believers in the piece of land God gave us where within months we had 55 people living there the conditions of life were hard we needed housing we needed shelter we needed appropriate clothing we needed nourishment but we had no organizational connection while the churches elsewhere in America were having great prosperity and God did not allow us to make our needs known you know what our slogan was? the just shall live by their faith we were tested in America we were living in the United States but not by the United States we were a piece of the kingdom of God whose economy was determined from heaven and not from the earth and not one of us perish you can't imagine our conditions we had a sister who was pregnant giving birth so we thought we had better plug the car in overnight or the crankcase will freeze the oil we have electroplasts so that the oil does not freeze I know you can't imagine it for us that's normal and sure enough she had birth difficulties and was hemorrhaging and we wanted to get her to the hospital well the engine started but the gearbox was frozen stiff but she survived the just shall live by their faith whether in Africa or America God is going to have a people in the earth who know him, love him, serve him and say with Job yea though he slay me when will I trust him that's why the Lord opened doors for us Egypt and other parts of the third world countries many times in Africa but we did not come to them as Americans yes that's my passport but the truth of my identity is in heaven amen so I'm not speaking to you abstractly we have paid the price for this message that you might believe it for Africa but there's no other answer for Africa it's not going to come through technology or natural resources don't hope for that it's going to come from God the just shall live by their faith so Africa is called the dark continent but God intends that it will be the brightest spot in the earth when the church of Africa rises to assert its moral presence the leaven of the kingdom and the authority given it by the risen Lord who said all authority has been given me both in heaven and on earth go ye therefore into all the world preach this gospel not just a formula for salvation but a formula for righteousness for keeping the lifestyle for reality and keeping with God's image but go with the authority that is already mine go with the authority which is already mine I'm not sending you out as orphans I have made every provision for Godliness and for life but it will take your faith to appropriate and to believe for it to insist upon it to insist upon it realize it, show it forth you don't have to go to a university you have only to be serious about your own Bible start reading the book of Proverbs every day today's the 16th, read chapter 16 you'll always come away with some rich truth of a practical kind that God tells you how to walk what to do with your feet and with your eyes this remarkable instruction to live a moral, righteous life if we don't ignore it part of the provision for Godliness and life in chapter 14 of Proverbs God says in verse 31 those who oppress the poor insult their maker and those who are kind to them honor him being poor in the world is not an accident it's a sovereign design to test nations and governments and men on how they treat the weak and the needing and the helpless and dependent God says to honor them is to honor me now listen to this if you have the spirit to hear it you see that flag that nation which you hope to succeed is going to fail is going to be brought down there's a judgment coming that's necessary to chase in Israel and to fit it to be a nation of priests and light up to the world Jews are going to be uprooted all the world over and we read in the prophet Amos I will sift you through all nations so prepare for the day when it's not just one Jew who comes in here but a number of them struggling, weak, bruised beat up, despised, hated unclean wearing filthy rags no opportunity to wash stinking and Jesus calls them they will be stripped overnight no matter what their possession they will be made very poor and the attitude of men toward them will determine their eternal destiny we need now to have a regard for the poor as being identified with their Maker and to oppress the poor to exploit them to take advantage of their ignorance is to insult their Maker that's what the scripture says and we ought to live by it change our own attitude and not to be contentious of Africans in our midst who are poorer than we look how ironic this is that those in power in Cameroon today are more contentious of the poor of their own nation who are Africans, Black than the white colonial powers had ever been that's a shame for the nation they are more indifferent to their condition unaware and unconcerned than even the white colonists had been Black does not save you but faith does so you need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling but not only your own salvation but Africa's for if the church will not take this to itself from where shall we expect it the church is the leaven of the kingdom now it's already the first installment the first expression of a kingdom to come that is different from the kingdoms of this world because it exalts righteousness because it loves truth because it's based on humility because it will not yield to violence or to bribery or to corruption it will believe God rather than to take advantage by paying under the table God loves those who hate bribery you need to go into the older world to save and restore Cameroon and what is made in God's image that he might be glorified Africa has a destiny that it hasn't even begun to understand to glorify God in a way that no other continent has the possibility the world is not expecting anything from you and you yourself are not expecting which is a lack of faith to rise to God's intention and to avail yourself of his every provision his word, his blood, his spirit his fellowship of the believers themselves and to express a reality of another kind that will affect the nation and the continent and make it very bright can you believe for that? that's why God's going to bring Jews through here they would never have come if they had not been uprooted but Africa will be a highway of holiness for the Lord Chief of the House of Israel where they shall see in black faces the light that lightens the Gentiles and the glory of the people of Israel they'll be astonished that you have mercy toward them that you're full of kindness and grace that you're not really guarded private lives you're an extract of people and you show forth God in a way that Jews would never have expected to find it not just in the faces of Gentiles the way that I was saved in Europe but in the faces of black Gentiles up to the demonstration of God's glory where Jews least expect to find it they'll go from Africa to Zion the redeemed of the Lord will return to Zion with everlasting joy on their heads and mourning and sighing fleeing away because from the time that they're uprooting and through their typical to the nations they have seen a demonstration a reality of a moral kind which for them is their very survival and their salvation and people who are tested and prepared for a country maturing as sons and daughters who live by faith and could give their last cup of meal and flour without worrying what will they have left for themselves but because they will give to them first God will seek to it your oil will not fail it'll be your salvation you just shall live by this it needs to be getting out I want to pray for such a church such an example such a model not just for the nation it will make requirement of you the scriptures will become much more earnest and sincere you will now need to study to show yourself approved the work may not be to be ashamed you will not make excuses for yourself you will extend yourself by faith to grow and increase as the sons and daughters of God and he will honor you and bless you because you're honoring him who has called you to more than a succession of services to a kingdom of righteousness in the earth even now Lord, bless these children thank you for the word because faith comes by hearing by the word of God break the power of depression break the power of inferiority of those who have a low self-esteem we're not capable we can't hope to be like you we're black Lord, we condemn that we rebuke that demonic spirit we lose your people to see themselves as accepted in the beloved and esteemed in God's sight and very precious and called for example, in the world bless this people and bless this nation for them and bless the continent that darkest Africa will no more be called darkest but brightest because God is in its midst as the people of faith who live by him who trust him who receive their calling and rise to fulfill it in the power of his resurrection from this night forth seal the word and bring it to our remembrance show us the issues that are moral that we might attend to them rightly and pleasantly in your sight even when it's inconvenient we will choose what is right and not what is easy for we are the church of Jesus Christ in this nation and this continent Amen
