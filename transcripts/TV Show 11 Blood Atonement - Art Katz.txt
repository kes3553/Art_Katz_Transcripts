TV Show 11 Blood Atonement - Art Katz

Ben Israel with Art Katz and Paul Gordon shalom welcome to Ben Israel my name is Art Katz and I'm Paul Gordon we rejoice to be back with you again today and we've enjoyed some of our recent times together reviewing the letters that have been sent us and discussing them and responding to them and we just invite you to continue to write to us and share with us your impressions of the program the kinds of questions that it may raise in your mind there's a little card fall that I failed acknowledging last time that really warmed our hearts where a lady writes dear Art Katz please come to Raleigh thanks a very interested Yiddish Mamala so Yiddish Mamala thank you for that lovely card it blessed us and we pray that you've been watching regularly and that that the program has been rich and helpful for you you know that Paul we're in that time of the Easter and and for certain strange reason I get the poignant response in my heart when we come to the so-called holidays because I know that there's a God who intended sacred holy days but rich men have made holidays in modern times and I think like the Christmas season which is an orgy for spending and that kind of celebration and office parties mindless activities and we lose sight of the fact that it really is a remembrance of a deep Jewish occasion the actual advent of the Messiah so too do we lose understanding of the meaning of the Passover and Easter season people are going to go about now buying new spring outfits and looking for breaks from school the kids will be going down to the beach and having a blast young children will be rolling eggs on Easter lawns and our own kinsmen will be eating matzah but I feel that for both Jews and Gentiles in the modern world there's not the true recognition of the solemnity and the sacredness and the things which these occasions touch we are spent some time today discussing a little bit about Passover the origin and what it means and perhaps continue on in another program to come where's a reasonable place to begin such a question well I'd like to read in Exodus 12 chapter but before we start I'd like to ask God if he'll just quicken these words to our hearts and bring out his meaning because this we've got to be saved from shallowness and from the want of true and that's right so father we ask you now as we are about to break bread together in your word Lord that your meaning your will would come forth by the Holy Spirit the Ruach that it would be quickened to our hearts and to our spirits that your words would be hidden in our hearts Lord like David said that when your words are hidden in our hearts we shall not sin against thee so Lord quicken these words we thank you in the name of Jesus the Christ amen okay we're going to read in the 12th chapter of Exodus starting with verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be on to you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and then in verse 5 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it oh the last there's an 11 first that says and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover right now the first verse began and the Lord spoke and the last verse of the section says it's the Lord's Passover we want to emphasize again for our viewers that the Judaism to which we subscribe is that the Lord spoke it is written this is something not devised of men this is not the result of the vain imaginings of men something conjured up by a wise Moses to bring a people to a place of obedience that they might be handled for a wilderness trek these are ordinances which are given of God and truly as we survey them as modern men now Paul what is there in these that would commend itself to our intellect that our understanding the taking of a lamb one perfect and without blemish in the height of its life keeping it on investigation for four days and then killing it and taking the blood how many were shutter at this and and marking the door post of them and the lentils of their homes that when God saw the blood he would pass over them now let's read the purpose of God called us to do this for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the Gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord before we read the next verse I just like to point out that the Jews at the time were residing in the land of Goshen which was in the land of Egypt now this is important because God said that he would smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt now and the blood shall be to you a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt now what do you think would have happened to a Jewish home where the blood had not been striped on the side post on the upper door post of the home well let me try and imagine first I can see the kinds of perplexity that this word this sharp and fearful word must have occasioned in many hearts we haven't done this before yeah this is not part of our tradition this seems to us alien this is related to the practices of Gentiles around us blood sacrifice we don't like this whatever the reasons it doesn't commend itself to our understanding but I tell you that those families that were not obedient to do the word of God must have suffered the loss of their firstborn that night because this is something that the Lord spoke it was a requirement made of him and our obedience does not hinge upon our understanding the wisdom of such a practice as this but actually we must do the word of God and God does not choose the things which commend themselves to us he chooses rather the things which are foolish and which really offend our sensibility and our understanding that we might be a people of faith and a people of obedience you know it strikes me that we hear the same thing today when we talk about the sacrifices in the temple and the fact that since 70 AD when the temple was destroyed by Titus and the Roman hordes that there are no more sacrifices now what is a very common thing that we hear today well that was a barbaric practice we're sophisticated now we've become civilized and it was it was just a practice that was for that day but as nothing long required well let me ask you Paul how do we go from this foundational thing given in the book of Exodus which established the nation Israel to the modern-day Easter which is practiced by Christians is there any relationship between these two things well of course to us there is why don't we explain that well we know that a pattern of God a law of God was that without the shedding of blood there was no remission for sin now we don't profess to understand why God set up this practice it was because he willed it it was just something that God would do and I think it's presumptuous of us to even try to second-guess them say that was barbaric and why would he do but we do know that that was his pattern well Jesus was two thousand years ago the Paschal Lamb the final atonement the final blood sacrifice for all time that those who would adhere to the atoning work of Jesus as he shed his blood for the remission of our sins it would be the same as striking the doorposts of our homes with the blood of the Paschal Lamb you know in a sense this sounds very Christian and very un-Jewish but however much it sounds alien to ears that are hearing this from us now we want to say again and again that this is very Jewish and is given from the very beginning this practice of the shedding of blood for the remission of sins was something enjoined of God from the beginning it began the very bit it was for the first of months in the beginning of the nation Israel and when God established in the wilderness experience a priesthood through Aaron the setting up of a tabernacle the essential practice of that Jewish religion was the sacrifice of animals their shed blood being brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled there by a high priest for the atonement of the sins of the people maybe we ought to just hesitate for a moment and ask our viewers to consider what the word atonement really connotes atonement means at one mint with God to become at one with God and a lot of people who think that we're always in a state of being at one with God but that is not what the scriptures imply in Isaiah the 59th chapter we read behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hit his face from you that he will not hear there's a God who changes not a holy God who says that our iniquities have separated us from him and there must be something a to atone for these iniquities and in the 17th chapter the book of Leviticus when God was laying the foundations of his biblical Judaism we read the reason for the shedding of blood for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul you know and there may be some opposition to such clear statement as these well that was an ancient practice we've since evolved and progressed from the time and that was necessary maybe that's necessary for blatant sinners but I do good deeds and I contribute to this cause and that and I buy Israel bonds and how would you answer a person who would speak in that way well like I think the only way to really answer that is that there are two ways there's God's way and there's man's way and God says that without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin that we are all separated from God by our sins what if we don't feel like we're sinners well according to the Word of God it doesn't matter much how we feel it's a matter of believing the Word of God or not believing the Word of God that's a whole thing in a nutshell if God said we're sinners and we're separated from him by our sins we've got a choice well where does he say that well he says that all through the Old Testament a good example would be an Ezekiel in fact I was just reading it here when we were speaking in the 18th chapter of Ezekiel God says therefore I will judge you oh house of Israel every one according to his ways sayeth the Lord God repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die oh house of Israel no Paul I think that this is so fundamental a question that we don't dare glibly pass over this there are great many modern people who feel themselves righteous they've never committed adultery they've never murdered they've never committed a heinous or blatant act or transgression or sin and therefore they have by their own human reckoning an exalted understanding of themselves which is in contradiction to what the Word of God says this is an important point people and we just want to impress this upon you you don't dare make a fatal reckoning that because you don't feel yourself to be a sinner and because you've not committed blatant sin that somehow you've escaped the Word of God that pertains to all men God does not see as we see nor his thoughts our thoughts and he says that if we failed in one point of the law that we're guilty in all and many such scriptures are they that if God should mark iniquity who can stand there's not a righteous man upon the earth that doeth good and sinners not and here for example that's the consequence and in the 64th chapter of Isaiah but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf in our iniquities like the wind have taken us away there is none that called upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities people we are all as an unclean thing I know it's not flattering to be told that but I believe that we have an obligation to express to you something of the substance of God's statement about our human condition irrespective of the subjective feeling that you have for yourself and I know surveying my own past life Paul that I did a kind of unconscious spiritual bookkeeping where I felt that although I may have transgressed here or there it was and they were not too serious an offense that somehow because I was involved in progressive causes yeah because I was involved in it for mankind and I distributed leaflets and did did did did that in God's bookkeeping office that the one offset the other you could mark up spiritual brownie points but what does God say to us by his spirit in Isaiah all our deeds are as filthy rags in his sight there's nothing that we can do to establish a right relationship on the Psalms that if God would mark iniquity who could stand not one person all right so God concludes that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God that the wages of sin is death or separation here we are separated from him both here in this life and eternally and yet that God has provided an atonement through the shedding of blood now what has this to do with the messianic and biblical faith which we have been suggesting to the people is the essential and only real faith of the living God well one thing is that we believe that the requirement of God for the shedding of blood has never been requited that it's never he has not abolished this pattern well let me ask you this if the pattern has not abolished been abolished the requirement has not been done away right we all know that in 70 AD the temple was destroyed as Jesus prophesied not one stone was left standing upon the other the priesthood was dispersed along with all the Jewish people to all of the corners of the earth we have no way of even identifying today those were of the priestly tribe we have no temple we have no sacrifice how then can atonement and reconciliation yet be affected well as far as any traditional orthodox position it can't be because in the traditional biblical requirement of God the shedding of blood is the only thing that can require sin so I would say that we have to start looking for another provision by God if the temple was destroyed and it's interesting you know that the temple was damaged when the Jews went into captivity the first time right but the temple was rebuilt again but the when Titus came to in 70 AD it was demolished just as Jesus prophesied that not one stone would be left standing the Ark of the Covenant gone the the altar gone everything that was meaningful concerning temple life gone and utterly destroyed it seems to me that God once and for all put away the practice of animal sacrifice after he provided the one-time sacrifice of Jesus the Paschal Lamb you know that on a previous telecast we mentioned Simeon who is called a devout and just man waiting for the consolation of Israel whom to whom God had promised by his spirit that he should not die till he would see God's Christ as a matter of fact people except that we do see God's Christ on this side of the grave we shall die there shall be an eternal separation but God will reveal that Messiah and that provision for those who are devoutly seeking it I think such a man like Simeon must also have been John the Baptist a a Jewish prophet intensely crying out and making scrape the way of God for that one who should come after him and in the gospel of John we read this enormous statement in that very first chapter the first time that John beholds this Yeshua this Jesus the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and sayeth behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world what an enormous statement to make at the first appearing of this Jesus who indeed was killed as a lamb of God and who made his blood available that we might mark the doorpost and lentils of his house and you know that the corroboration doesn't stop there we read that this first lamb which had to be without spot and without blemish now consider this a spot and a disfigurement might be obtained in this lifetime but blemish is something with which a person or a lamb is born there is only one who could provide the eternal atonement one who would be without spot impeccable never having sinned but also born without blemish Jesus acknowledged that he was this lamb and he said for this purpose have I come no man takes my life I lay it down and his final words from the cross it is finished and here we see a perfect correspondence between that first lamb and the second lamb it's interesting also Paul I think to note this that there was a four-day period of time when this first lamb was kept for public observation you know that if there be any defect that might have been detected before its use it was selected on the tenth day of Nisan and killed on the exactly the same day thousands of years later when Jesus of Nazareth rode triumphantly into Jerusalem on the back of an ass being hailed by Jewish people at Hosanna the coming of the King with a strew leaves and boughs of the tree in his path and he was proclaimed as the King of Israel for four days he was publicly available and finally when he was apprehended he said to his men to these men which of you can convict me of sin not only was there a four-day period which he made himself available but in a certain sense his whole public ministry his three and a half year public ministry was an opportunity for the world to examine him and see where he could not fulfill the requirements of this being the eternal lamb of God he fulfilled every messianic prophecy including Isaiah's prophecy in the 53rd chapter where he went like a lamb to the slaughter without opening his mouth that's that's enormous I don't think that we would be doing our viewers justice if we didn't make some reference to this enormous 53rd chapter and I would say that this is almost the heart of the biblical messianic faith and of course those who disagree with us claim that what's being referred to in this 50th 53rd chapter is not a single individual a Messiah a lamb of fulfillment but rather a description of the people Israel in the nation which of course there is a certain suggestion of that because as a nation we've suffered but yet as we carefully examine this text we find that God is indeed speaking of a certain individual in fact if we back up to the 52nd chapter of Isaiah beginning with the 13th verse God speaks of a servant my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and be extolled and be very high these are words which are reserved only for the divinity of God to be extolled and to be very high but many were astonished at his visage his face were so marred more than any man in his form more than the sons of men so shall he sprinkle many nations in that condition and that battered beaten condition shall he sprinkle many nations and Kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider why don't you read on for us now this very famous chapter which by the way is never read in synagogues and very few contemporary Jews have any knowledge of this okay who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not scriptures tell us that when Jesus came to his own his own rejected him and received him not surely he have borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I think that's a fantastic verse for us all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened up not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off he was killed out to the land of a living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death and Jesus when he was crucified was laid to rest in the garden of Joseph of Arimathea one of the richest people in Jerusalem at that time because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he was entirely innocent yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in hand I just want to read that once more when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed and prolong his days on the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of a soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge so shall my righteous servant justify many and he shall bear their iniquities he's speaking about you and me therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he has poured out his soul onto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors you know the scriptures tell us that he who had not sinned was made sin for us I can't think of a more definitive statement of God's messianic biblical Judaism than this enormous chapter of one that was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed and he went as a lamb to the slaughter for the transgression of my people was he stricken no people it's one thing for God to make this mighty provision it's another thing for us to avail ourselves of it many centuries ago Jewish men and women had to take a shrub plant and dip it into the blood of that lamb and apply it to the doorpost and lentils of the house it wasn't enough to contemplate it it wasn't enough to consider it they had to do it and something also is required from you even today if you'll have it by an act of faith even now you can receive that blood which was shed by the Lamb of God for the sins of the world and your sins by faith taking it and applying it to the lintel of doorposts of the of your heart and your life even now why don't you do it and enter into this Passover season with a new joy a new deliverance from an Egypt of slavery and bondage to sin for which you will eternally rejoice in God let's see you precious holy God yes Jesus we thank you for the Lamb of God for the Messiah the Holy One of Israel who took upon himself our sins and our transgressions who offered his back to the smithers and his beard to the pluckers Lord that his blood might flow that we might have an eternal atonement the reconciliation with God the Father from whom we have been separated by our iniquities may there be those now even as we pray who are crying out of their hearts and say oh Lord I receive the Messiah of Israel and his precious work save me have me this day in Jesus name
