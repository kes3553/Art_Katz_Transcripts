The Three Wise Men - Art Katz

The world itself is not worthy. As we say in Brooklyn, if only my mother could see me now. And in fact, she is seeing me now. Because she is in the air with the invisible cloud of witnesses. Do you believe that? She was saved ten days before her death. After 40 years of obstinate opposition to her believing son. Because I was a great personal disappointment to her. Because Jewish mothers like to say, my son the doctor, my son the lawyer.

Not my son the evangelist. But nevertheless, because she was prayed for all over the world for 40 years.

Ten days before her death.

At the age of 96, she followed me in a prayer to receive Jesus.

And so unaccustomed to speaking that name. That her next prayer was, God if I've done anything wrong, please forgive me. But it was too late. The damage was done. She got saved.

For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

You know what she said the next day? She said the way is narrow. What about the others? And the day after that? She said, if you only knew how much God loves you. She gave ten days of evidence of having passed from death to life. She's over us tonight in that cloud of witnesses. Enjoying what she is seeing. And blessing us together. Okay.

So I want to share with you something the Lord has quickened for me today. From Matthew chapter 2.

Which was part of my devotional reading. And not part of the theme that I thought I would be addressing in these days.

It's about the visit of the three wise men from the east. Who came to Jerusalem.

Following a star.

And in verse 2 saying. To Herod the king. Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. And when Herod the king heard these things.

He was troubled.

And all Jerusalem with him.

This is what arrested my attention this morning. Have you ever been arrested by the text? I like this better. The next time I'll be in your lap. So I'm asking you a question. Have you ever been arrested by the text? A familiar text. One you've read many times. And read through without stopping. Because your reading is religious. And not spiritual. You're reading so many chapters. Your religious obligation. You can boast how many chapters you read. But did you really read it? Were you stopped by it? Were you confronted? Did you think it unusual? Listen to this again.

When the king heard from these wise men who were not even Jews.

That they had seen a sign. That a king had been born. He was troubled.

And all Jerusalem with him.

Troubled? Shouldn't they have been excited? Rejoicing? Why troubled? So I looked it up in other versions of other Bibles. We should have other versions of other Bibles. You have only one?

Ask the Lord for another.

Another version, another expression. That you can compare. And in my other Bibles. It says not only troubled but frightened. And one says terrified. That raises a question.

What could the birth of the Christ child mean? That it would frighten or trouble or terrify a king? And not only he, but all Jerusalem with him. Why should there be frightened or troubled or terrified? Of the very advent for which they were waiting.

That deserves our examination. Because we know that every word is inspired by God.

Adventitious position in life.

Which is true.

Because this king is the king of kings.

And there's no other room for competing kingdoms. Even when he appears as a child. He constitutes a threat. That will terrify men. In proportion as they have kingdoms to defend. Let that sink in.

And all Jerusalem with him.

They were themselves not the king. They were themselves not the king. But they shared the same vested interests. They were in it together. But they were sharing the same vested interests. They were in it with him. Enjoying the benefits of his false rule. Sharing in the profits of its corruption. In the system in which they identified together. Therefore all Jerusalem was troubled.

If this is what happened in his first advent coming as a child. That will set in motion the murder of his entire generation in Bethlehem.

What will his second coming mean? As king. I'm showing you how to read the scriptures. And draw out these questions. And these implications. And turn them over in your mind. And weigh them up in your heart.

What is it about the kingdoms of men? That are terrified by the advent of this child.

Then and now. So don't become taken up with Herod. Or whatever the equivalent is today. Because nothing has changed. A little difference in language and culture. But the realities are the same. Universal and unchanging. That's why the Bible is more than a piece of history. It's full of instruction. Appropriate for now. It's interesting to compare Herod with Joseph. You just happen to glance back into chapter one.

Who is described in verse 19 as being a righteous man.

And he was unwilling to put his wife away. When he found out that she was pregnant. And did not yet understand why.

But being a righteous man.

He was unwilling to expose her to public disgrace. And planned to dismiss her quietly. But he had no sooner come to this decision.

Than an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. And said Joseph son of David.

Don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife.

For the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

And she will bear a son.

And you are to name him Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins.

Do you know that that's what the name Jesus means?

In Hebrew, Yeshua.

From the word to save.

And the JE, Yeshua. Is from Jehovah. Jehovah saves. God saves. Is the actual name of Jesus. And the angel said that's what you shall name him. Because all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet. So when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him.

Do we have plenty of time tonight? We don't have to rush. We can linger over this text. And draw it out at leisure. Well, on these things. Because the contrast is remarkable.

Between Joseph and Herod over the same issue.

The birth of a son. The birth of a son. The birth of a son. The birth of a son.

And I feel like saying in the liberty of the Lord.

They represent the only two choices.

Either we will be righteous with Joseph. Or we will be wicked with Herod.

And nothing in between. Because that's the nature of something of reality when Jesus comes. Even as a child. The very reality that he is requires one thing or the other. You'll either be troubled that he's coming or rejoice.

He's a righteous man. He's a righteous man. And he did what the angel of the Lord commanded him.

He took Mary for his wife. And withheld any kind of intimate relations with her.

Till the birth of Jesus. And when the son came. He named him Jesus.

Why? Because the angel said.

You shall call him Jesus.

Because his name is important. His name says something. It's what he has been birthed to perform. So it's not for you to choose some alternative. Or name him after a dead relative. Or some name of which you are fond. The angel spoke. Joseph did it.

He was a righteous man. And he was the son of David. It says that he had a dream in his... And when he awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. May that be true for us.

To any degree that we are asleep. We need to be wakened. In order to be obedient.

That we might also be the sons of David. And obey the angel of the Lord.

Because every step of this is necessary. And no obedience can be omitted. And if you follow the text, there's dream after dream after dream. Joseph dreamed. Take the child and go to sleep. Joseph dreamed. Take the child and go to Egypt.

For there are those who want to kill him.

Being in Egypt, Joseph dreamed.

And the angel said, Bring my son out of Egypt. Those who have sought to kill him have died.

Remarkable to be led by dreams. But what does that mean? A dream does not automatically bring an obedience. Because you can always say, Was it God? Or was it last night's tacos? Was it indigestion?

Because the angel said, Take him to Egypt until I shall require his return.

Well, how long will that be? How convenient will that delay be? I may not mind Egypt for a short time, but God didn't say how long. So you can always avoid an obedience by saying, It was only a dream. It's a dream that makes a requirement of me that I'm not willing to perform. I can attribute it to tacos, and not to the angel of the Lord.

But he was a righteous man and chose to interpret the dream not as indigestion, but as coming from the Lord. So he obeyed every dream that he received. Precious man that he is. And great contrast to Herod. And what shall we say of the three wise men? What an embarrassment for Israel. That three men who are not even Jews are more excited about the advent of Israel's king than Israel itself.

Jerusalem was troubled. Terrified.

But three gentile men who are wise are willing for the inconvenience of following a star. And when the star stopped over the house where the baby was, they rejoiced.

I can't find it. Here.

They rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Verse 10. What a statement of the low spiritual condition of the people of Israel. That the same thing that troubled and frightened them was the very same thing that made gentile, wise men rejoice.

So was it then? So is it now. Are you rejoicing for the babe? Are you wise? Are you detached from Herod, his kingdom and his system? Not that you're getting rich by it. But you may have the ambition so to become rich.

So our hearts are revealed by our response to the babe.

Either to rejoice or to be terrified. Then or now.

And far from seeking the wealth and riches and benefit of Herod's kingdom, the wise men when they found the babe gave of their treasure.

They didn't come to benefit themselves.

They said, where is the king that we might worship him?

That's more than singing choruses. That's opening your treasury and giving the best of what you have. That's giving the best of what you have. Not in miserly proportions, but extravagantly as for the king. You got any gold?

They gave gold and frankincense and what was the third spice?

Myrrh. Full of symbolic significance. That you have never contemplated. You have never contemplated. But you're going to contemplate it now. Because everything that we're reading is not just a mere description of what happened in history.

It's loaded with symbolic meaning and context and instruction that you might grow thereby and become larger in the faith and the knowledge of God and His way.

Because that actually is gold. What do you mean, brother?

Gold is the symbol of deity.

And you'll have it in your treasury in proportion as you have Him.

And your increase in the knowledge of God and His way. And the knowledge of Him is pure gold.

That's what you're getting tonight from me.

The best treasure that I have is the knowledge I've accumulated and the understanding and the communion and the relationship with the living God.

Have you got gold to give?

Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

You know what the remarkable thing is? It has nothing to do with where we were born, how educated we are, what advantages we had in life. Brother, I didn't go to a university. I'm not trained in any profession. I'm not a businessman. It does not matter at all. This gold has nothing to do with natural circumstances.

This gold is in proportion to the relationship you have with the living God. The measure of devotion you've given to Him, the getting up early to seek Him, the acts of obedience to obey Him, increases your wealth in the knowledge of the Lord and the proportion of the reality He constitutes in your life. That's the treasure available to every saint.

And we each one have it. We each one have it in proportion to our investment.

Praise God for the wisest men.

They didn't come to gain. They came to give.

We came to worship the child.

God forbid that that should be reduced to cheap choruses that only require singing. That's not worship in itself.

Worship is giving of your treasure, of your life and your substance for Him alone who deserves it. And who in fact has given it to you, which can also be expressed with your songs. But our songs are not a substitute for our treasure.

Only the expression of it. You're understanding me.

Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

Sometimes I need you to finish the idea so I can translate it.

So King Herod asked of his scribes and of his religious priests. Where is the child that these wise men are seeking? Where does scripture say he is to be found? And they told him, Bethlehem in the land of Judah for out of thee, Bethlehem the least of all the cities of Judah shall he come forth unto me whose goings forth are from old and from everlasting.

It's not in the text. Just follow me.

Whose goings forth are from old and everlasting and is to rule the people of Israel. This son is born to rule. The issue of Jesus is the issue of government. For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder. Now your time, your money, your life your future where you're going to go what you're going to do who you're going to marry and what you're going to invest who makes those decisions the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord.

It's not for you to determine or any man your government needs to be on his shoulder.

He's born to rule over all Israel even the Israel of God which you yourself are. And that's why they sought to kill him. And that's why they will seek now again to prevent this Jesus this son of David to be seated upon the throne of David in the holy hill of Zion in the city of Jerusalem that the Lord might go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. Now listen you dear saints listen this is the hard part the issue of Jesus and the issue of the nation Israel today and of that nation's restoration to God is the issue of the coming of the King and his kingdom and that's why every power of darkness that operated through Herod 2,000 years ago to kill all of the boys in Bethlehem up to a certain age is the same power now that will seek to prevent the King from coming will seek to prevent the King from taking his throne and from this people to be restored to him that he might rule over all Israel that his kingdom might come Now we Christians are guilty of thinking that the kingdom is something internal subjective and personal we are guilty of thinking that the kingdom is only something internal something that can only be within us and we don't understand what the kingdom of God is within you as if that's the whole statement about the kingdom but I'm pleading with you tonight to understand something absolutely foundational or we cannot understand the subject of Israel in the last days the kingdom of God is actual political rule of God over his entire creation so much so that when it comes men will turn their swords into plowshares and their spears they'll study war no more there'll be no more conflict between nations because the King who has come will arbitrate between nations in justice and in equity the coming of Jesus is not to establish our escape the coming of Jesus is not to establish our escape the coming of Jesus is to establish his kingdom in the place where the wisdom of God has prescribed I have set my son on the holy hill of Zion Zion and have given him the nations for his inheritance kiss the son lest he be angry with you kiss the son lest he be angry with you I can't think of any single statement more important for your Christian understanding and one that will wake you from your sleep is that the issue of our faith is the issue of the kingdom it was God's intention from the first and it shall be established at the end so that there may be justice and this may grow in the earth when the King rules as the son of David upon the holy hill of Zion in the city of Jerusalem in the land of Israel the actual, literal, geographical place and the conflict of the last days in which we shall be involved and be opposed by the powers of darkness is as much to prevent that reality at the end of the age as they sought in the beginning by the destruction of all of the children of Bethlehem because Herod is a murderer and a liar and he is troubled by a true king and in order to avoid and he lost to himself he was willing to do what the Pharaoh did and destroy all of the boy male infants so that there would be no prospect of that child surviving and taking his rightful place on the throne of David because Herod is a usurper and a political appointment by Rome he's not a true king he's a political adventurer full of ambition and all of Jerusalem with him and nothing has changed as it was then so will it be again at the end we're called to something very real saints so we need to have treasure gold first but then frankincense and myrrh frankincense is the ingredient that went into the anointing oil that's fragrant have you got any?

do you need any?

or are you living a Christian life where you can perform by yourself out of your own ability your own well-meaning intentions your own intelligence you don't need the anointing and the anointing of God as I need it tonight to speak to you not out of Jewish cleverness but the anointing of the Most High in an obedience to speak what was given this morning that has got to do with my rational choice but you say brother you can afford to miss it it's only a meeting so it doesn't have to be perfect you can get by and these people will appreciate any measure that's not a kingdom mentality I'll tell you how a foolish man like myself thinks tonight and these days together are once and for all and will never be given again we were not fishing and looking around for a place to speak this speaking was appointed of God beginning with this subject I did my duty my first two nights in Monterrey speaking elsewhere but not with the anticipation and inward joy that I had in coming here tonight this is why we are here the other was preliminary this is the chosen appointed people whom God is wanting to instruct and prepare applause so we have to say with the Apostle Paul who is sufficient for these things Lord if tonight is more than just a makeshift occasion if this is appointed and known of you not just in recent times but before the foundation of the earth was laid you foresaw this night and these days as a work to walk in and have called me the privilege with my brothers so to perform it because it is appointed and therefore must be anointed by the unction that comes down from the throne of heaven the holy anointing oil which is fragrant and without which we can do nothing nothing of any value as it pertains to the kingdom more than you know not only is the anointing oil required for me to speak this required for you to hear but when I came in and saw you I have to confess university graduate that I am the author of several books in many languages my heart sank a little because you were not visibly impressive I did not get the sense of worldly achievement there may not be another university graduate in the entire audience the thought that came to me this is a simple people can I succeed with them you know the way you are your manner of speaking your vocabulary your concepts Americans have difficulty following you I need a dictionary when they are reading your books so how will you succeed with this people by the anointing of God not only on the speaking not only the preaching but listening and the last spice they gave was the myrrh which has to do with burial it has a kind of fragrance of it's the rarest of all fragrances the most expensive and most exquisite of all substances you got any in your treasury to give prolifically to the king to the child who needs to be honored and worshiped with gold and frankincense and myrrh have you ever died multiple deaths for the lord have you ever performed an obedience that required your humiliation have you ever suffered an unbelieving and drunken husband and yet remained with him no matter how much you were abused and humiliated because you love the lord who says he hates divorce wherever you have suffered humiliation misunderstanding rejection of which I am an expert an expert there is the place of death and humiliation and being put low have we any of that spice to give it's the dearest of all and most precious in his sight when we have it to give because we are willing to be crucified and buried with him we are willing to bear his reproaches and be misunderstood by men even of Christian men who say now you are going too far this is too radical too sacrificial we are invited continually to death Paul said I die daily there is always some mortifying thing some requirement some challenge you don't have to look for it it will find you if you are walking in the way and following after the lord you will bear his reproaches so may that fragrance fill this house that you cannot concoct in a laboratory they cannot manufacture it from chemicals it's the real thing it's authentic this fragrance is unmistakable this fragrance is unmistakable to those who bear it in proportion to their suffering for Christ's sake so may we be a wise congregation so may we be a wise congregation to follow the star and find the child and give him worship by giving him substance out of a treasure of things both old and new accumulated in a life of obedience and now following after the lord because if there is no worship there is no service no true service or we can manufacture ministries and be busy and do things has no enduring value if we are not sent ones and performing the appointed things under the anointing of the lord because our service comes out of our worship and is not an alternative to it in fact true service is a worship as I trust you are receiving tonight and its fragrance amen and so Herod said to the wise men if you go and find him and when you have found him let me know to worship him also Herod's worship is murder not honoring so he is deceitful and manipulative you go and find him and tell me that I might also worship what a portrait of the kings of this world who say the right thing and the religious thing and seem to have the appearance of right intention that I might worship him but at their heart selfish ruthless have no real intention of worshiping but killing good thing that joseph obeyed the angel in the dream arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be there until I bring you word for Herod will seek the child to destroy him pick up and go to a place you would not have desired that may prove inconvenient and your business might therefore be neglected and languished and where you will even battle maybe even with the language and no matter the practical consequences you must not stop to see the problems arise get up and go and take the child until the word until is very uncertain it may be just a week a month a year years he is not told and you know what it is he is a righteous man and he does not need to be told all he needs is to be commanded to arise and go and take the child until had he failed in that had he rejected that dream that's too radical a requirement that can't be God maybe the devil wanted to get us out of the way Egypt has always been a perilous place for Jews it's always a perilous place for Jews that can't be God wanting us to go there but he awoke he took Mary and the child and he went and he remained until he had another dream to say it's safe now to return where I've called my son out of Egypt well you know we're just getting begun we're just beginning here this is precious this is precious and inexhaustible rich significant it enables us to become enlarged in the Lord and obtain treasure true worship true service to the King Son of God Son of David that everything that the prophets have spoken might be fulfilled tonight or tomorrow find time and go over chapter 2 for yourself and mark every place where it says that it was fulfilled according to what was spoken by the prophets or what God spoke by the prophets it was fulfilled even the suffering of the slaying of the young boys in Bethlehem was spoken in the prophet Jeremiah according to verse 17 of chapter 2 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying in Ramah a voice was heard lamentation weeping great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not because Herod when he found out that the wise men had departed and had not returned to him to show him the child he became exceedingly angry infuriated full of rage and fury and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coast thereof so we mustn't ignore this part that somehow is part of the original pattern that with the coming of the king as a child there's a necessary and furious reaction against him that will not spare the innocent that violence is going to be expressed in a way to seek to prevent the coming of this king and that there will be lamentation and mourning it was then at the first it will be again at the end there will be a fury poured out that will not be satisfied without violence and murder and anything that appears to be related to the coming of a king and we need realistically to anticipate that also it says she would not be comforted she would not be comforted but there's a comfort that will come and we need to understand that but there's a consolation that will come and it will be eternal for any measure of sacrifice that we have to bear in the ruthless violence that will come in the last days against the people of God who are seeking the return of their king against the people of Israel who no longer will be terrified by his coming but will say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord and upon them will the violence be poured also upon them will the violence be poured also so I'm preparing you for the messages to come a serious time serious requirements for the people of God some of whom will not die in bed of old age who are in this room right now who are in this room right now I'm not expecting to die in bed I'm not expecting to die in bed there's going to be a fury poured out in the last days on all of the sons of David the righteous sons of Joseph who can be led by a dream until and have accumulated treasure of a king they will be marked objects of opposition it will be our privilege to bear it it attends the king's coming and we will have eternal joy when he wipes away every tear and when he comes he brings his rewards and gives to every person according to their labor according to their service according to their worship so let's thank the Lord for the privilege of something more than a mere study the pattern that was given at the first and will be again at the end for the end time people of God who are instructed and are aware and expectant and counted all joy to be called thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord so Lord we thank you for tonight you're the God of beginnings and endings the great Alpha and Omega who alone knows the end from the beginning and given us this beginning because you already know what is yet to be unfolded in the preparation of this people for their participation in the things that pertain to your honor and glory in their identification with the people Israel and the coming of their king and our king even Jesus the Christ the holy one of Israel and the head over the church Lord we bless you we're grateful for the privilege of being called to serious things that conclude the age in a way similar to the way in which it began separate us from Herod and Herod's kingdom from false piety superficial religion tell me where the child is that I might worship him also is deceitful play acting that is deceit characteristic of a Herod whose false religion ends with murder take that out from our hearts Lord in any way that has come in we want to be separated from it from the ambitions of the kingdoms of men and be single light for your kingdom only thank you Lord precious God we give you praise for your blessing for your call for your word for your will receive our gratitude in Jesus name amen
