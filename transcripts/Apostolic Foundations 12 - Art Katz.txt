Apostolic Foundations 12 - Art Katz

So, precious God, we come tonight thanking you for your faithfulness, Lord, in all these weeks, the unfolding of your great apostolic and priestly heart to us, Lord, so merciful in the way that you've looked upon our frames and know that we are as dust, Lord, and to give it to us in installments and to bring us from where we were, my God, to where you would have us to be, to put before us heroic challenges, my God, monumental things.

You are the Alpha and the Omega of these days. You gave this occasion, my God, no man sought it. You gave the beginning, and now we ask also that you give your conclusion.

We look to you, my God, so grateful for the anointing that was alluded to tonight, for you know, my God, without that holy anointing oil poured out from the throne of God, everything is hay, wood, and stubble.

Your anointing is your very life, my God, the essence of your being, that vibrant life-giving and penetrating quality. It has nothing to do with deserving, my God. We're having put sufficient time in prayer as to warrant it.

their gracious gift unto the church to them, and we ask it tonight, Lord, that your word might go forth to kindle something in our hearts and to melt them and to work a concluding work in these days.

Be with my mouth now, by your spirit, and be with our hearing, our hearts, and our responses.

And we'll thank you and give you the praise for all of your great faithfulness to us through these days and the days that are before us, for Jesus' sake and in his name we pray, amen.

Well, I think this is the first in 12 weeks where I've come up with only a Bible and only one Bible, no supplementary reading material, no outline, nothing, just the Bible. I guess I was banking on a very small turnout tonight and we would just kind of draw our chairs up a little circle and I would whisper intimate things. So maybe we'll still do that. I can't quite get away from last week's theme that in the last analysis when the smoke clears were all the great principles of the kingdom and all of the heady apostolic themes that God has been sounding that in the last analysis, what it deduces itself to and what is at its heart is the personal relationship between the believer and his God. And that is the foundation and that is the apostolic thing. And when we have lost that thing, we're just marketing principles of the kingdom or government or divine order or some of the kinds of things that we think to have apostolic we major upon. It will be false. It's not an agenda or a set of principles in which God would have it to be inducted, but into a whole mode and manner of being and thinking and relating. So I've been reading through the Gospels. If I didn't share this with you, the Lord has kind of wrapped my knuckles somewhere in the course of these 12 weeks to show me that I myself have been overlooking the true foundation, paradoxically speaking on the apostolic foundations of the of the faith and neglecting it myself, for there's no other foundation that can be laid than Christ Jesus. And it's not the principles or even the apostolic epistles as precious as they are. It's the person of Jesus himself and that my intense Jewish zeal has kind of disguised and neglect of my relationship to the person of Jesus. And as a matter of fact, there was something residual in my Jewishness and in the monotheistic emphasis that we Jews have had that did not make sufficient room for him. And therefore, something was neglected for the want of that relationship in my own being, namely the humanity of God, God in the flesh that would affect one's own humanness. And the brothers who brought me this very precious insight and word also commended to me that I needed to major on the Gospels and not leap over it as if it's kids stuff preliminary and that the heavy weight stuff are the apostolic writings. So I have been devotedly reading the Gospels every morning and every evening through these weeks and being reintroduced to Jesus and finding precious things in the Gospels that I had not seen it in previous readings. And I want to begin tonight with just where I presently am in the gospel of John, beginning chapter 14. And the gospel of John, I don't have a word. I mean, wow, it is well, it was in the gospel of John that the Lord gave me that initial revelation twenty three years ago aboard a deck of a trance steamer and route to Greece, which was my spiritual homeland due by birth, Greek by conviction. The humanist, the philosophical not going to the land of Plato and Aristotle and Socrates. And rightly on that journey from Italy to Greece, the Greek book, the New Testament came into my hands for the first time, never willing to have opened it in times past. So arrogantly contemptuous of any one book that could be purported to be the answer. But now I was ready to the dealings of God and to a life that had come to its own unhappy and pathetic conclusion as a headstrong, self-willed, self-righteous Jewish man.

And in the very first reading in the gospel of John, in the episode of the woman taken in the act of adultery, in the one statement out of the lips of Jesus, let him who is without sin cast the first stone.

That sentence came up off the page, penetrated my eyes, my brain, my whole body began violently to tremble. And instead of stopping and lodging in my mind, which I thought is the seat of life, the false author, it went down into my heart like a shock to a disorder and cleaned me in two. And I was just left a trembling call from above the deck of a chip in a moment of time with the absolute certitude in that moment that there's a living God. I'm reading his book and Jesus says who it claims to be. So you can understand why I have a special endearment for the word of God and for the gospel of John in particular. And it's inexhaustible, as is true of all the scripture, to keep drawing the enormous riches and even to go beyond the meat and to suck the marrow out of the bone. You'll never come to the end of it. Sweetest, most nutritious part is the marrow. And maybe we who have been content with meat have moved from milk to meat, thought that that was the end of the line. But I want to commend to you the marrow, the real drawing out, the real borrowing in for the nuances of the word of God and the, what's the word, the tremulous things that God can hit that through his word, even between the lines, so to speak. Well, what I'm going to share with you now is not that these are basic observations of chapter 14, verse 15. If you love me, you will keep my commandments. I heard that so long that I kind of numbed my way through the love plot and didn't realize that the keeping of the commandments is not a kind of act of human diligence. It's the response of love. God has so stacked things in his genius and his infinite wisdom that obedience is impossible independent of a loving relationship. He's not going to allow us to become technicians or to move ahead in religious zeal, which was the kind of thing of which I was, I've been guilty for so long and have impressed the saints in that condition. Yet you can obey, but I think that the quality of the obedience and the fruitfulness that will issue from it will be less if your obedience is out of conscience, out of religious requirement rather than out of love. So God in his brilliance has rooted everything in the issue of the relationship with him in love, which beats the law, it beats legalism, it beats orthodoxy, it beats everything. But to find that relationship, to nurture it, to maintain, to go on, to deepen it is the thing.

In verse 23 of that same chapter, if a man loves me, he will keep my word.

Here again, the conjunction between love and obedience is reiterated. And my father will love him, he will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me does not keep my words. There's the long and the short of it. That if there's a failure of obedience, we just simply have to recognize the failure is the failure of love. We don't love him adequately, or our obedience would show it. And I think you can make the case that this has always been so. This is not just a New Testament doctrine. This has always been the genius of God with men.

So for example, the Lord did not come to Israel till Sinai, but what preceded Sinai, it was the great deliverance out of Egyptian bondage and through the Red Sea that parted at the demonstration of the mighty power of God, who brought them out by the blood of the Lamb and then assembled them at the base of Sinai and brought to them the law that they should obey it out of the love that grows from gratitude for so great a deliverance and so great a salvation, which is exactly true of us.

If we don't love him enough, remember what he said to that Pharisee into whose home a woman came, a street prostitute, where the guy murmured, and he said if this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman this is, but what did this woman do? Despite the humiliation of coming into a men's fellowship in that culture and time and without saying the word, breaking an expensive alabaster box and pouring the content of this precious ointment upon the feet of Jesus and weeping over his feet, wiping them with her hair, and Jesus said to this guy who was murmuring under his breath, and even Jesus' disciples were murmuring, this money might have gone to buy literature, but to help the poor, what a waste, but it was the extravagance of love by a woman who had heard the message or recognized in Jesus her salvation and the gratitude eventuated and issued in such a love that it was expressed in extravagance. And maybe we need to say tonight that the love that does not express itself in arrogance is not love. If it could be measured by the symbols, symbolful, if we are mean about it or chintzy and feel that if we put a dollar in a collection plate or if our church attendance has been regular, that what more can God ask? We have not experienced what that prostitute experienced, namely a gratitude for so great a salvation that lavishes upon Jesus and upon his body, the body of Christ, things that would make us poor. If a man loves me, he will keep my word. I think the first time that I really broke before God as a young believer was when at a certain full gospel breakfast in Kansas City where I was a young missionary to the Jews, the speaker said, when I was a younger believer, he said, I rushed to do the commandments of God.

I was obedient to every commandment that the Lord showed me, but he said, as I have gone on in the faith, I no longer wait for the commandments.

That's kid stuff. You have no alternative when God commands but to do. He said, now I intimate his will. I intimate the very disposition of his spirit, and I rushed to do it even before he commands it. You know where I was before the last word came out of his mouth? I was on the floor and under the table coming apart at the scenes because I had probably complimented myself for my diligence in obeying, but to intimate the will of God, not to have to wait to be commanded, is such an expression of a love that just fastens on him and delights to do his will even before he speaks it. Can you imagine a church like that? The whole house will be filled with the fragrance. And on the occasions when I've preached this, this broken alabaster box, which my wife thinks is my greatest message and probably is, I say we have been correct. We've been charismatic. We've learned all the principles. We know how, but our house is not filled with the fragrance.

And in 2 Corinthians, I think the fourth chapter says, and by him, the triumph, his triumph is made manifest by us in every place.

The knowledge of him, the fragrance of him is made manifest by us in every place. You imagine watching the fragrance of Christ in the office or in the seminary, in the classrooms, in the shopping mall, or with our neighbors and our own families because of something that exudes out of our very life that is broken and that wants to keep upon the Lord the expansiveness of the inward thing that has been mined in us. For man loves me, he will keep my word. He who does not love me does not keep my words.

And the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me. At the very end of that chapter, verse 31, but he says the word, the verse 30, the rule of this world is coming, but he has no power over me. But I do as the Father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the Father.

Rise, let us go hence. I know I'm taking great, great liberty, and my professors would cut me down in a moment to say that rise and let us go hence is anything other than a directive for physical walking. But I want to be very suggestive tonight and say, rise, let us go hence.

Let us do as Jesus did, who did as the Father commanded him so that the world might know that I love the Father.

Even his obedience to the Father was not some grisly compliance to a taskmaster. It was born out of love for the Father. And it's an obedience that took him all the way to the cross, as only loving obedience can, because I think that principled obedience or guilt-ridden obedience or religious obedience will break down somewhere before that place. Only the obedience of love will bring us all the way through as it brought him. Let us go hence.

So, and again, even to abide in his love and to increase in his love is to keep his commandments as we're told in verse 10 of chapter 15, and then in verse 12, this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. Not only is it the issue of obedience, it's even the issue of faith, as chapter 16 indicates in verse 27, for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I have come from the Father.

I don't think that that believing was some kind of logical deduction with the data that was presented by Jesus, some kind of bookkeeping acknowledgment, yes, that you must be the Christ, because look, this, this, this, this is fulfilled. I think it's a love that made believing possible. It's a love that opened the floodgate of credulity and dissolved away the stubborn, human, resistant, unbelief. So even here, love is the key to believing as the key to obeying. And so if you have trouble with faith and you don't know why you can't believe and why you're nervous or anxious in your faith and you don't have the quality of faith, maybe again, it's not that you have not been rubbing the genie lamp and invoking the promises meticulously in order to obtain something by a formula, but that the issue is much deeper, that the failure of faith is the failure of love. Everything points us back to the intimate personal relationship with him. And with that as a preliminary, I want to take you to my real test for the tonight and for tonight in the Old Testament, a very precious and favorite text, Exodus, the twenty fourth chapter.

And this is the chapter that describes how the law was attained and given to Moses.

I never cease to start to be awed at the cursedness of the scripture, how compressed, how so much can be said in so few words, how God doesn't wallow in redundant and unnecessary things. Very sparse, very lean. They crucified him. Jesus wept.

And here in a few verses, such an episode of this great man, Moses, being summoned by God to the top of the mouth and there to receive the tablets of the law, which is to be the basis for the whole obedience of the people of Israel to their God and the key to their witness to the nations from verse twenty four reading, he said to Moses, Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abba, you and seventy of the elders of Israel and worship afar off. Moses alone shall come near to the Lord, but the others shall not come near and the people shall not come up with him. Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances and all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words which the Lord has spoken, we will do. And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord and he rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the people of Israel who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of option to the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins and half of the bloody through against the altar. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, All that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient tragically.

We know that wasn't so. There was a failure of love. They went hooting after other Gods. They were unfaithful. They looked for some voluptuous alternative to the God who met them at the mount.

Then Moses took the blood and threw it upon the people and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words. Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abahu, who were the sons of Aaron and seventy of the elders of Israel, went up. And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet, as it were, a pavement of sapphire stone like the very heaven for clearness. And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel. They beheld God and ate and drank.

I think it was the first communion between God and a people. And then here's our text.

The Lord said to Moses, Come up to me on the mountain and wait there, and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commandments which I have written for their instruction. So Moses rose with his servant, Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God. And he said to the elders, Carry there, carry here for us until we come to you again. And behold, Aaron and her with you, whoever has a cause, let him go to them. Then Moses went up on the mountain and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel. And Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain and Moses was on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights.

Amen.

The Lord said to Moses, Come up to me and be there, and I will.

And I want to say that I believe with all my heart that that is the quintessential definitive apostolic requirement. You say we were talking about the word apostle was not even yet invented in the time of Moses. But I see Moses as a foundational servant, a master builder, and he all of the configuration of the things that that make up that which is apostolic pertain to him. And so this call is critical. It is the key. It's the it's the difference between the fourth and the true apostle. The false apostle is one who can market the principles, one who is good and facile in in intercalating segments of the apostolic scriptures and applying them to a present church need or having even some facility to help churches in their need or in their crises and and be an older responsible brother or even established churches in the franchise McDonald's way. But the difference between the true apostle and the false. It's not goodness. It's not facility with apostolic phrase theology or an ability to do something for fellowships or to seem authoritative. The difference is the man who has gone up and the man who has not the man who has remained below and thinks to serve God and his people without having made this ascent. I want to bring you into remembrance that 12 or 13 weeks ago and all this began without any collaboration on my part because at that time I didn't even get myself know how the Lord was going to fill these weeks and I have not known except week by week of the day of the actual ministry to receive that word. But you remember what happened that Sunday there was a mountain made in the sanctuary and the pastor and his wife wore high mountain hiking boots and short pants later hosing and the whole motif was going up the mountain and that was the kickoff for these weeks and how does the God who was the Alpha begin how does he end as the Omega by giving me the text today and come up into the mouth and come up on to me in the mouth and be there. You say what's so apostolic about that everything everything everything everything it may say in your text as it doesn't mind come up and wait there but the King James and other versions read come up and be there and I want to say tonight for your discerning hearing that the world is dying for the want of proper being. You shall be witnesses unto me and we have misread that to think it means and you shall do witnessing for me everything issues out of being true ministry true witness is out of being not out of doing doing is the is the very thing from which God wants to deliver us it's true to do you stick to legalistic to outward it's being come up unto me and be there and I will give you the tablets of the law which I have written and I think he just says that that thou mayest teach them it doesn't mean that God's up there or some kind of expedient provider that well we have to make one last dissent however arduous to get the thing that will enable us to perform our ministry and I'm taking pains to elaborate that because I know you I know me I know us we are American we are modern we're impatient we're expedient we're utilitarian we'll do just that minimal thing that is required to obtain that which serves our ends even religiously and even spiritually speaking but the woman with the alabaster box went far beyond expedient and and as we have been willing to be only merely expedient with God how then have we been related with each other no wonder that we don't often hear confessions of men publicly that their marriages are askew and appealing for the prayer of the saints I said to all the in-house before I left the house tonight if the handful of souls will come out tonight will come under the burden of this need in my own marriage and we would agree together in that holy place I'll get a phone call by the time I get home with the wife saying come every depressing spirit every discouraging spirit everything that has robbed her of hope and faith for the future or for the continuance of this relationship will be dismissed when something is broken in the heavenlies by the people who are together who can go beyond merely the expedient and the necessary thing fragrance is going to have to fill the house again it's not just come up and be there and then you'll get it's come up unto me come up unto me I'm the end in myself I'm not just a means to an end I didn't just save you that you should be delivered out of this and that thing and that you should be equipped to do this or that the whole purpose is to come unto me for my own sake without any thought of the consequence or what will be the result or the reward or the benefit so long as that tinctures our thought about relationship with God we have not ascended this month this mount is the mount of the negation of all expediency it's come up unto me and be there alone for my own sake be there you know if we really search our hearts when is the last time we have really been anywhere in that kind of totality even when we're talking with one another I know what I'm guilty of my mind is already racing and I'm thinking of something for tomorrow or I can't even wait for the person to finish I'm ready to answer them before they've gotten their question out of this statement as if the issue is giving them an answer you know what I've learned in community and the many crises and problems that we've had to experience all of us began to dawn on me over the years the frequency of these crises and insuperably difficult problems that the reason that God was giving them to us was not that we should seek a solution but that we should seek him because he knows our sloth he knows that we've been calibrated and inducted into the mentality of the world that we only go so far as is necessary to obtain our end and as soon as that thing comes in sight that's the end of our seeking him and what is an apostle in the last analysis why is he foundational to the church why is the church built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets because they're clever because they're good because they have a command of the principles of the scripture and I'm not negating those things but something more because they communicate very God because you tell me what is a church that is built on correct principles and has correct procedure and correct church order and divine government and every other requisite thing and has not the sense of God it's a it's a caricature my God give me some sloppy flat dash out of joint broken awkward groping bundle of saints who don't even know what divine order is who yet have something palpitating there's yet a fragrance there's the sense of God because the world is dying for the sense of God who he is that cannot be communicated by principle it's the fragrance of him that is to be made manifest in every place not the principles about him but where is that to be obtained only in one place come up to me and be there what an assent and you think it's just a cutesy little hike and you'll get there without hardly being winded you're mistaken I can tell you by the time you get there if my experience and community and in fact my whole 22-year walk and my own present struggles are any indication of what it is that with God is leading us tortuously through such paths as except your eye is fixed on him you can't even find your way to the top it's wheezed in smoke at the time you get there you're bloody you're dripping your flesh has had burrs and briars embedded you've twisted your ankle you stubbed your feet you you've sweated and you're just a mess of sweat and blood and dirt and groping with your fingers and clamoring and every single thing that is strident and logical is is ruining you to come down don't be a fool it's a it's a vain exertion to defy gravity like that and to go up three times in the year the men of Israel were required to go up to Jerusalem of all places to locate the house of God and the holiest place of all where the obedience to God was to be given it had to go up there's always a going up and we've lost sight of that look we've lost sense of that with automatic drive and turbo power and all that kinds of things that there were a little touch of the toes zoom hey this is going to cost something to go up this mountain it's going to cost something psychologically spiritually physically morally and you're alone and everything else is below with all of the clamoring details and the weight of them and the things that need to be attended that you never are able to get free from it did I tell you about the time when I was preaching and and I said that the church was born in waiting in the upper room and that it needs to continue in the spirit of waiting and waiting is the priestly disposition that has been lost to our modern sensibility and some young kid just newly saved came to me after the service of mr. Kevsey said in all of your travels around the world you said have you ever found the fellowship that has waited ten days on the Lord like like the early church and my mind raced through these brilliant fellowships where have I not been the biggest the best finest the most powdered and lauded and I had to think no I don't I don't know one entire fellowship as it was in the days preceding Pentecost waited on the Lord together waiting is going up waiting is sacrifice waiting is dying what do you do you twiddle your thumbs what about the boredom we need distraction we're sensual we need something voluptuous for our seeing for our hearing we're full of mindless we knew new ideas something novel something but what do we do for ten days with the same thing locked into one place and after the young man asked me if I'd known the fellowship then the Lord took over and he said okay how about your fellowship how about your community that has opted to go up into the woods and into the rugged and the remote parts to find its way back into the apostolic lifestyle when are you gonna wait ten days in the world I was doubled over hit in the solar plexus the wind went out of me I came back to whisper to the fellowship you know what the Lord said to me hey that's great art one day we'll do that when it's convenient when the kids don't have to go to school when there's no great demand on ministry when the phone is not ringing we're not this neither yeah well as soon as they're you know what we found that time never comes the world is never accommodated and even the religious world fills you with so much consternation and go and do you know what we had to do the kingdom of God suffers violence and the violence take it by force we declared the elders beginning Monday we're commencing a ten day period waiting on the Lord we're stopping every thing every thing no cooking fasting ten days no program no no business no detail we're going to wait on the Lord we didn't know how to do it and we elders are going to begin first and so we started in by the 3rd or 4th hour we were dozing off right the Lord is you know full of love full of patience he knows our friends and he showed us how to do it three hour shifts around the clock 24 hours a day unceasing prayer and so you rotated and you find yourself in a prayer shift from 4 to 7 in the morning with saints with whom you've never prayed before so you've been in fellowship with them 10 years and on the seventh day of the fast when your breath smells like a camel and you've long since ceased being able to pray spiritually or even significantly or even intelligently and your prayer now is just a drum I remember myself in that condition on the floor founder of the community on the floor with two or three of the other saints in the same kind of whacked out condition too feeble even to raise our voices and it was holy it was precious it was revelational you say art when the ten days were over did the fire of God fall don't think we didn't need it but it didn't you know why because if we had even set up viciously in our own minds calculated hey listen we're investing 10 days of fasting and prayer around the clock we'll get our reward we'll get the fire of God to fall we would have invalidated the whole meaning for the word waiting the moment that you establish a condition or look for a reward or a response for your investment it's no longer priestly it's no longer waiting it's no longer going up it's an experience expediency it's a means to an end even if it's a spiritual end it stinks because there's a God who is still waiting for the fundamental apostolic requirement come up unto me and be there just for my own sake don't worry wonder what the benefit will be to you or how it will enhance your ministry or what greater anointing you're now going to have or insight or revelation or they'd be able to I have been in the very presence of the most high I'll tell you when the 40 days getting up here just like the 10 days of fasting and prayer around the clock you don't have any motives anymore you know that you know what I realized when I stretched out and it's just a piece of Hulk one thing I realized was in all the years we've been together in community we've had three day fast five day fast for critical decisions about overseas trips and urgent matters we have never really adequately sought the word we put in what we thought was the modicum required to obtain the end mainly the revelation of his will should we shouldn't we but we had never really sought him and when I was in that condition in those wee hours and I realized he is the creator and I am the creature and in this prostration before him with with my tongue cleaving to the roof of my mouth dry and unable even to beat anything that it was faintly spiritual I am in my proper place before him now I have a sense of who he is as I sense who I am properly and this sense of God is everything to restore this sense is the apostolic requirement for what shall we communicate if we don't have it but if we make it a means to having it we'll never have it it's just simply a love of God that beckons us come up unto me and be there your mind your soul your thoughts your emotions all that you are the totality of all that you are come before me as a total God that I am and let totality meet totality because that's what the faith is all about that's deliverance that's healing that's salvation and once we find it with him I think we're going to be another people with each other we're not going to be doing it by the numbers like those paint sets you know 17 is purple and 12 is red and when you're old when it's all finished it's lean out of the vintage last supper it's not going to be like that there's going to be a transformation in proportion to the fact that we have come up unto him and been there I think we're going to be to each other something new something else something far more attentive something far more patient I had the privilege of being counseled by John Sanford and the anger came at the end of it I spent two weeks with this precious man in his basement and when Inger came we finally sat down together and he gave me my report card I only got a C and I thought I was doing real well I didn't blow my cool and I was rather calm and gallant and he said Artie said you were responding to Inger outwardly and literally as if what she was saying is really what she means I said huh he said you did not at all relate to what she was really saying to what she really is that's that's what a dumb dumb I am because I don't know how to be there if I've not found it with God how shall I find it with my wife or with men to enjoy the saints to appreciate each other even when we're not amusing even when we're not clever even when we don't have some great insight or revelation just to enjoy the present just to be together we don't have to say anything lady be there is everything and for the want of that ability an entire modern civilization is going to arrive they're flipping out they're freaking out they're driven to find some novelty some new alternatives some clever things some orgy some drug that they've never tried before some new fetish any kind of thing to break the science that they're they're driven because they've never known how to be there and there's never been a church to show them because we're marked by our own restlessness and by our own drivenness we've not been there and been called up into his presence on the seventh day and I want to say it's more than just going up however great that is and turning a deaf ear to everything that says stay down here and some of you have already experienced that you're becoming fanatical what's the matter with your religion as we've known it you'll hear worse things than that there's something that infuriates even the religious world by those who begin the ascent maybe some of us have begun it and were discouraged and turned back and came down below where the others are and have gone on in a lackadaisical and nondescript christianity because we didn't persevere to the top if i would say anything about these 12 weeks of speaking but some total of them has been a call to come up unto me and be there moses did not eat nor drink and he says the cloud covered the mountain verse 15 the glory below rested on our sinai and the cloud covered it six days and on the seventh day he called to moses out of the midst of the cloud no accident that six is the number of men seven is the number of divine rest where we cease from our own doing but for six days he had to stay in this mountain in this mountain weed with smoke and i want you to know that that was not marshmallows or cotton candy or something that you fly through that that is white and and fluffy this was a frightening thick smoke of the fire of God's presence six days in it will extinguish anything in you that is humanly religious see how do you know us or because i had six minutes in thick smoke that has revolutionized my believing life up up at the community the building caught fire where we were staying one night about three or four in the morning we heard the crackling and smelled the smoke and we got out in time with the best building we had and my wife was beside herself she said you'll go in and get my pocketbook it's right on top of the kitchen counter man i knew that kitchen like the palm of my hand we had our meetings in the living room i've been in and out of place countless times sure there's no problem i bent my head low i went into the front door and and that kitchen counter could not have been more than the distance between me and and the first row here the moment i entered into that smoke not only could i not find the counter i could not find the door through which i just entered i was completely and totally humanly what's the word disoriented i lost every bearing i couldn't i couldn't tell you where i was how to come in and go out it was an absolutely stupefying experience for a man that has lived for over 50 years by his wit by his intelligence by his ability by his command by his knowledge to be totally disoriented that there's nothing to which one couldn't turn into himself or outwardly for guidance for direction when you're in a precarious and even a dangerous situation i never did get her first i never found the kitchen counter and only by the grace of God did i find the door to get out again thick smoke moses was in it for six days of course this was a prince in egypt this was a man who was tutored and skilled and all of egyptian law and metaphysics and and mathematics and whatever their civilization offered and he wasn't altogether uninstructed in the things pertaining to the God of Israel and to be in that smoke for six days means a total emptying you don't come before this God in that presence with your charismatic know-how with your brittle cleverness and your formulas and how to do it we know but we don't know as we ought to know and we'll never send that mountain we're correct if we're content merely to be correct there's something beyond being correct there's something beyond truth there's truth in truth if i can put it that way there's truth that has come to us by listening to tapes by reading books and there's truth that has come to us that comes to us out of the presence of God that is ultimate truth that is real knowing and that's why my prayer has been every week lord let me not stand before these people except that i can speak to them as one having come out of your presence so i want to ask you not only are you willing for the rigors and the otter of going up and turning the deaf ear to everything that will keep you below but are you willing also to enter into something that contains the number six by which you'll be emptied of your humanity and everything that has been humanly obtained are you willing to come before God as a boob as not knowing as without your own cleverness without your own artfulness without your ability to put fellowships together and teach this or that or witness or all the things in which we think that we have know-how and comprehension and to receive from him out of his presence the tablet that he has written that's what i think this suggests and i've tasted this this smoke a little bit i know the humiliation of what it means to be missionary to the jews and not have a single message on prophecy in Israel the only one in the whole mission board how come on don't you have a concordance sure i got a concordance but i'm not going to cleverly make up a message however correct it is about Israel and prophecy i'll only preach it in the day that the lord gives it by revelation out of his presence then you have a word then you have an understanding then you have a knowledge and maybe what we can say about our charismatic generation that that that's exactly what we've not done we've established systems discipleship and we've had orders and hierarchical pyramidal structures of who's related to who and we've taken precious and divine ways of God and transmuted it transmuted it into some kind of human claptrap system that victimizes rather than ennobles and uplifts because you can't take the holy things and transpose them we need to receive them out of the presence of God when we have come up to him and been there then we can come down the mountain then we have something to offer that's not plastic but written with the finger of God upon his own tablets then we can find Israel going the muck and dancing nakedly around the golden calf too impatient to wait as for that man moses and finding its own substitute charismatic alternatives that seem like the real thing and sound like the real thing but are false and to come down and to dash the tablets in divine anger what is it moses the meekest of all men i'll tell you what was a conjunction between divine anger and divine weakness only the divine unique can express the wrath of God not a matter of temperament or personal irritation and where did he obtain that meekness he was fused to the God who is very humility itself in the fire on top of the mount he saw the glory of God he was in the presence of God and that if that will not establish meekness in the soul of a man i don't know what else will you'll never learn it as a principle only out of union with him who is meek and says learn of me whom lonely and meek of heart and here he was expressing the hot indignation of the man who's meek and he ground that golden calf to powder and tossed it in the drink and made them lap it up and you don't hear so much as a whimper the same Israel who is this moses and that was continually bucking against him and railing against him and revolting you don't hear a whimper of opposition who were you to require this because he who was naked was indignant was also authoritative and it wasn't an authority that was tied to his office it was tied to his person it was infused in his being because he brought the very sense and presence and authority of the God in whose presence he had stood in that seventh and final day that's the basis for authority not human expertise or cleverness or our credentials or what school we've graduated or our experience or our experience but the sense of God that has been obtained in communion with him any other authority that is braggadocio bravado is false the false apostles and the false prophets are those who've never ascended up willing to go and moses entered the cloud and went up and moses was on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights so i'm getting my signals that my time is out and i gave you an invitation last week to enter within the veil i'm giving you an invitation this week to ascend up to the mount and really it's saying essentially the same thing come up unto me and be there and i will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commandment which i have written for their instruction that thou mayest teach them there'll be another kind of teaching it's not going to be some glib anxious performance it's not going to be a clever guy doing the right thing it's going to be communicating not just the law but the lawgiver because you bear the very sense of him having come from his presence that's apostolic that's the ingredient in the quality for which the church is perishing and what shall we say the world freaking out for novelty diversion distraction entertainment because this glory has not been communicated by men who have come up so let's say yes to the lord if the coming up means a trial in marriage physical difficulty whatever kind of emptying whatever breaking from earthly things that God is about you heard his voice in these weeks and these nights come it's something that no man can presume to do without being invited but once you ascend go all the way precious God Jesus yes may we hear your voice tonight my God may we hear threaded throughout all of the speaking what you're saying to us it's not a bible teaching it's an invitation come up unto me and be there we ask your forgiveness lord for our distraction for our partial coming for our inadequate union and relationship lord for our expedient mentality we're only willing to give my God what is needful to obtain what we think is required it teaches what totality means teach it teach us what it means to come up and to be there before the God who is total pure actuality to be there in our minds our hearts and all that we are to be there for your sake and not for something that will be that we will obtain by coming for you our precious God the end all and the deal you're the thing in itself you're the precious source you're all in all lord bid us come help us to make this ascend bring us into that precious union willing to be emptied my God of our own notions however correct that we might receive from you out of your presence the thing that is burningly true if we might receive my God authority meekness all that's required into coming into the land we bless you and we thank you and we say yes to you lord and we come for Jesus sake in his name amen bless the lord well i appreciate the elders and whoever else wants to come up and pray and the first message was acts 13 so they laid hands upon them and so they being sent forth by the holy ghost when they pray that this is going to be a holy ghost sending and not the human cleverness that will be coming to men but something out of the heart of God to men who are living in a very critical place thank you Jesus hallelujah
