Israels Final Restoration - Art Katz

Thank you for a lovely introduction. It's my privilege to be here. I'm the one who's being honored. And my only fear is that I will spoil everything. Everything has been so lovely till now. But you don't know what you're getting. I wish that you had had a chance to read something of the booklets that are now on the back table. Some in English, some in Dutch.

Israel and the church of the last days. A famine for the hearing of the word of the Lord.

Not that it's not being spoken, but it's not being heard. It will be tested tonight. A powerful statement on Romans chapter 6. The heart of the Gospel. Which you should have obtained with your baptism. A little booklet on the true conversion. Many saved, but few converted. This is in Dutch. This should be in Dutch. The spirit of truth. But my Dutch publisher is a year late. My German publisher is late. In a book that I can't even hold up for you. It's called the Holocaust. Where was God? I have the chutzpah to raise the question. And the answers are frightening. Because in that booklet I not only attempt a biblical explanation, of the Nazi Holocaust.

But I speak a warning of a Holocaust yet to come. That if the word of Jesus, and Daniel, and other of the prophets be true. This Holocaust will be the end of the world. This Holocaust will eclipse the Nazi time.

One for which Jews have no anticipation at all. Nor does the church. If I'm right in my understanding. And many would love to see me wrong. I would love to be wrong myself.

And this catastrophe should come upon world Jewry.

But if I'm right. If I understand the prophetic scriptures correctly. It's a warning that needs to be sounded. The French edition of the Holocaust book, which is in print. Is now number seven on the ten most purchased French books in Switzerland and France. And that in only a few weeks. Because it is explosive and controversial. And that's where I'm going from here.

French Switzerland, Lausanne, Geneva, Where evangelical ministers want to meet with me.

Kiev in the Ukraine.

Where messianic pastors want to meet with me. Who are happily encouraging Jews to come to the Holocaust. Where messianic pastors want to meet with me. Who are happily encouraging Jews to come to Israel now. Who are encouraging the Russian Jews to come to Israel.

And want to understand my position. When I say to extend such an invitation.

To bring Jews from the frying pan to the fire.

So I'm a prophet of impending catastrophe. I've only had two messages in my last trips to Israel. The first one, which is about seven years ago.

Which I spoke seven times in the land and three times in Jerusalem. Listening to the howls and shrieks of the Jews. Which I spoke seven times in the land and three times in Jerusalem. Listening to the howls and shrieks and screams of people who were antagonized by it.

Katz, you haven't changed. You're as loveless as ever. Because my message was Ezekiel 37. The valley of dry bones.

The necessary death and resurrection of Israel.

Not as a happenstance. Not as a happenstance. But the necessary death and resurrection. Which we have no more disposition to consider.

Then the disciples of Jesus when he told them that he had, he must.

Or the same way if we didn't consider the disciples.

With the fact that the Messiah would have to die and then be resurrected.

Actually we have the same attitude of Peter. But now for Israel suffering. Let this be far from you. Let it not be unto you. Can't you succeed without it? After 50 years of statehood. Thousands of years in exile. Don't you deserve now to succeed? There is a must and an ought. Jesus rebuked Peter And Jesus rebuked Peter With the most severe words. Get thee behind me Satan.

For you savor, you smell of the things which be not of God but of man. For you savor, you smell of the things which be not of God but of man.

Very condescending. To have such a tender concern for his Lord. How humane and compassionate. It's the best kind of attitude that man can produce. And the one that Satan loves to employ.

To keep the Lord himself from his necessary redemptive death. To keep the Lord himself from his necessary redemptive death. Jesus said to the Jesus said to the disciples upon his resurrection Who were disappointed and dejected Who were disappointed and dejected Oh fools and slow of heart Oh fools and slow of heart Not to understand all that the prophets have spoken of Not to understand all that the prophets have spoken of Ought not the Messiah to suffer and die Ought not the Messiah to suffer and die Before he ascends to his glory We need it to be so amazed. Because we think that the whole subject of Israel concerns the success of the State, the nation of Israel. But there is something much greater that is at stake.

It's the glory of God forever.

And so much as I understand the scriptures and God's way that there has never been access to glory except through death and resurrection.

So let me pray. Lord save us from your rebuke. Don't let our well-meaning intentions get in your way.

That our humane consideration for Israel That our humane consideration for Israel keeps us from recognizing its necessary destiny.

There's an ought and there's a must. There's something intrinsic to the faith. It's rooted in reality itself. It's intrinsic with God. There's a suffering and a death that precedes the glory.

O, open our hearts to understand it and open our lives to embrace it. Or Israel will not have a chance and prepare itself for the soon coming catastrophe.

The necessary death that must come to pass. In Jesus' name help us. Help me to bear such a word as this. To have such a right heart.

Give them courage and stamina to bear the hard words of God.

And we give you praise in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, I mentioned the message given seven years ago, spoken seven times. I'm a foolish man who thinks much of the significance of numbers. Seven means completion.

And when I finish arranging the days of this trip beginning in Holland with this gracious invitation taking me to France and Germany, Switzerland and France as I've mentioned, the Ukraine and Russia, the Ural Mountains in Central Asia, and ending in Finland where every invitation has been withdrawn, because I found out that the churches that had invited me were outgrowths of the Toronto Revival.

And somehow they had learned that I had raised some questions about that phenomenon. So they refused to have me unless I can endorse that revival. So we're still going by faith.

Maybe the Lord wants to give me a rest at the end of the trip. Seeing that I've just come back from five weeks in Africa and we'll be going to Guatemala in September and Canada in July and South East Asia in 2001 to bring the strange message that the Lord has been pleased to give.

Well, what was your last time in Israel, Art?

Almost four years ago we had a conference for which no Messianic congregation would open its doors for a man who was saved in Jerusalem 36 years ago and had been coming almost every year in which they used to say that when Art comes to Israel the word of the Lord comes with him but they don't say it anymore. And so we had to have the conference in our hotel and not one soul came whom I've known for 25 to 30 years.

Only one woman to enjoy our food and to harass me while I was speaking.

And when I got home from the trip there were two ladies waiting for me one signed by 13 of the most eminent leaders one signed by 13 of the most leading significant men in Israel many of whom I've known over a quarter of a century condemning me as a false prophet giving aid to the enemy harassing the church and being terribly in error. One letter came from a Dutch brother whom I've also known over a quarter of a century 30 years His was a much kinder letter but equally as offended with me and this is my answer to him I have two Bibles with me tonight and three papers all the day and five days before we came and I'm trembling How do I proceed? How do you break into the consciousness of the church and the Jews and speak those things that must necessarily help us a good point of beginning is one of the great issues that have been raised it's the issue of the time of Jacob's trouble it's the issue of the time of Jacob's trouble it's mentioned in Jeremiah chapter 30 it's mentioned in Jeremiah chapter 31 it's mentioned in Jeremiah chapter 31 in Daniel chapter 12 Jesus in his Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24, Luke 21 Matthew 24 Luke 21 this is where he said that there's a trouble coming that eclipses all troubles that have ever been known since the world began and if it were not cut short no flesh would survive he spoke about the abomination of desolation that that that initiates this time of trouble citing Daniel referring to Jeremiah there is a whole body of prophecy that refers to a last days time of trial for Jacob wherever Jacob is not only in the present state of Israel but Holland as well in South Africa in Cape Town I was speaking to the church for the first time prepare yourself for the time of affliction to come upon the Jews of your own nation in a global anti-Semitism of the fiercest kind where a Jew will not be safe anywhere in the world I faced some hostile audiences of the Christian Zionist kind who did not want to have their world upturned didn't want to have to consider such a scenario and I watched God in one night turn them completely around so at the end of the night I could say to them pray for me I'm going now from South Africa to Zimbabwe and Zambia black nations that will be the route of flight of escape out of your South African cities for a surviving remnant of Jews and I had to speak this to the black church pray for me and they did I'm a believer now 36 years and I have never found a time when the issue of the exegesis of scripture the drawing out of the true meaning I've been a believer 36 years and I've never seen a time like this with the issue of the interpretation of scripture is more critical than now particularly prophetic scripture that can be read in several ways wasn't the valley of dry bones fulfilled in the Nazi time weren't Jews literally reduced to valleys of bones why then do you say this is a future event because the text itself indicates that in verse 11 we are cut off we are as dry bones for which God is still waiting for the people of Israel to make such an acknowledgement God turns to a son of man he's released by Israel's own acknowledgement of the truth of its condition prophesy to these bones that they might live that they might live God is still waiting to hear that acknowledgement what came out of the Nazi holocaust was not that we are cut off we are as dry bones but something of an entirely different character more in keeping with our Jewish character our indomitable self-sufficiency our never-ending self-sufficiency if you go to Auschwitz today where I have been many times Treblinka where I was on my last trip to Poland and in other death camps as it was in Treblinka in German, French, English, Yiddish never again God is still waiting what kind of God is this?

what kind of God is this? how far will he go? is one holocaust not enough?

not if it has not obtained its end the brokenness of a nation that is called for much more than just to be a successful nation it is called to be a servant son of a priestly kind to the nations to the Arab nations you do err because you don't understand what is our ultimate destiny and call and how far God will go to obtain it you are too success oriented in your own life and in your own church and project that kind of mentality onto Israel the point of contention between my Dutch brother and myself the point of contention between my Dutch brother and myself he says that the time of Jacob's trouble is past it is all okay now Israel may be going through present difficulties but over a course of time things will improve there is no necessity for your apocalyptic scenario Israel's suffering is past what an astonishment to believe that the Nazi time was the time of Jacob's trouble when the scripture makes it clear that it must have its inception in Jerusalem through an anti-Christ figure that will stop the sacrifice that had been initiated after three and a half years of a false covenant of peace in which Israel recognizes it has been duped that it was a false peace that it was a false peace and negotiated with an anti-Christ figure who now demands to be worshipped as God it is a historic moment that has not yet come and that will be the start of the whole catastrophe and I believe that it will be a wave of movement in the Nazis and from this terror or in actual captivity or being cast out into the nations even to the farthest corners of the world in which God says, I will return you that is your future and you will be able to compare two returns one essentially initiated and negotiated by man the Zionist state to which orthodox Jews do not yet subscribe nor acknowledge as valid because they believe in their understanding of Scripture and rightly so in my opinion that prophetic fulfillment can only come through God not through the allowance of His providence but the actual intervention of God demonstrably and visibly before the face of all nations as well as hopeless Israel itself that they might know that I am the Lord who has spoken and performed this fifty years of present Israel has not brought that acknowledgement and never will it is remarkable how mature men can come to their opinions when the Scripture so clearly shows that this time of Jacob's trouble has its initiation in Jerusalem itself how can you say that it was the Nazi time this does not initiate in Europe or in Germany but in the land and there was no state of Israel in the time of the Nazis my whole debate with my colleagues and my brother has opened to me a whole contemplation of the cross has opened to me a whole contemplation of the cross has opened to me after thirty six years in the faith twenty five years in community traveling the world in the Lord's service in a difficult marriage with a gentile wife in our thirty fifth anniversary I realized that every issue in the last analysis I realized that every issue in the last analysis is the issue of God I realized that every issue in the last analysis is the issue of the cross we are not speaking about an idle matter of difference of opinion we are not speaking about an idle matter that's why I have fasted today and to keep myself from the Shabbat table because what is that issue tonight is not a message or a man or a reputation but the issue of life and death of eternity itself if this catastrophe is coming and we have no anticipation and made no preparation we will be implicit and involved in Israel's death there is so much more than I can express there is so much more than I can express the issue of rightly interpreting the prophetic word the key I believe is given to men who are actually prophetic the key is given to men who are actually prophetic that is to say truly prophetic because I believe that the critical issue today for the church is discerning the true from the false prophets is discerning the true from the false prophets and classically what has been the difference between them throughout all of history one says peace, peace and heals the wounds of the daughter lightly and heals the wounds of the daughter lightly and the other says coming judgment disaster catastrophe and come into the arc of safety for there is a judgment that must come because it says in Jeremiah your sins will exceed that of your fathers and anyone who reads the Jerusalem Post regularly and anyone who reads the Jerusalem Post regularly knows that that prophecy is being fulfilled Jews practicing torture the exploitation of foreign workers the highest rate of abortion in the world where the first two abortions are free for every Israeli girl serving in the military where the first two abortions are free for every Israeli girl serving in the military and Satan attracts them in sorcery and in high school there are gangs that brand students with their cigarette butts if they'll not give them some shackles the highest rate of the abuse of women in physical battering violence and murder there's a whole catalog of sins I take no delight in announcing it but your naivety requires it because you have a romantic sense of us Jews you think that somehow we're some special kind of humanity we're all little Davids didn't you read that President Weizmann was indicted for taking bribery of almost a half million dollars while in office a scandal the highest position of the state and questions now about the misuse of funds by the former Netanyahu while he was in office and also Barack in the way in which he obtained funds for his own political campaign and why not?

is there any man good? do you think we have some special virtue? or are we man?

depicting for all the world an example for all the people of this world and what he will do in the perpetuation of his own interests when he has not access to God I have a prophetic way of understanding present Israel given not to succeed but to fail who else could have attempted it in half a century? to take a malarial wasteland and transfigure it into a high tech civilization to take a narrow liturgical language Hebrew and make it into a modern secular tongue in a nation that wants to be like all other nations the Hong Kong of the Middle East the second greatest internet computer software giant outside of California and the second largest internet computer giant outside of California and succeed in doing it well that's when my life collapsed when I succeeded born in the depression years raised without a father a mother who had to suffer and fight to keep a household with two children and later years I became a professional a teacher my mother's heart grew having achieved what I sought I recognized my failure in my success I could raise the great questions for my students but I could not myself answer them especially in the failure of my marriage to a German wife in which my good will and reason failed the Zionist state of Israel has given us opportunities to see the truth of our condition as we would not otherwise have ever acknowledged it in any other way if we had ever realized it what do you do with a captured suspected terrorist if he has information that can be extracted that might save another bombing in Jerusalem or a bus in Tel Aviv so the Orthodox don't have to come with their plastic bags and take the body parts off of the telephone wires is such a one going to voluntarily give information without coercion is taught unnecessary is taught unnecessary destiny we are required to employ means that we would never have considered as Jews while we were living in ghettos of other nations rightly a scholar proclaimed power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely even Jews especially Jews because we have the greater calling we have the greater honor we have the greater history we have the law what gives my perspective an additional strength is not only my confidence that I'm speaking out of an office that God has given but my own history for the last 25 years we are living for 25 years in northern Minnesota I know that doesn't mean anything to you but I can tell you it's primitive it's cold it's the coldest place in North America our temperatures are always lower than Alaska we are 100 miles from the Canadian border 8 miles from the closest town 20 kilometers population 200 and we've been there for 25 years and I'm from New York I'm an urban cultured man what am I doing in that primitive location preparing a place of refuge for Jews in flight in North America in the United States of America in the country that Jews have obtained their greatest success their greatest security God called me by a word community refuge when my foot came over the chain in the entrance to the property a bankrupt boys camp that's all the Lord had to say or we have made a mistake for 25 years trying to become food sufficient particularly at a time when we may not be able to buy or sell if anti-christ is going to expel Jews from their places of safety we will also not be the time of being required to take the number in our foreheads our hands we cannot buy nor sell how then shall we provide not only for ourselves but for the stream of refugees the least of these his brethren whom we shall see naked and rejected treading roads of a remote kind northern Minnesota out from Canada Zimbabwe and Zambia where they will come from remote areas from South Africa in brutal and primitive conditions that God says in Ezekiel 20 from verse 33 in the wilderness of the nations face to face and I will plead with you and there you will come into the bond of my covenant and into the rod of my authority as the redeemed of the Lord with everlasting joy upon their heads and mourning and sighing fleeing away for you dear saints you need a teacher more than a prophet so look at the booklets and there you'll have more detailed explanations of the frequency in the prophetic scriptures and I will return you from every place where I have scattered you with a fury poured out how else should modern Jews find themselves in northern Minnesota or southern Africa except a fury poured out has driven them suddenly out of their places of security the remnant of them that will survive will survive because of you or they will not survive at all well brother how do you read Matthew 25 prophetically prophetically Jesus separates the Gentiles of all nations He determines their eternal destiny the righteous inherit the kingdom of God who say when did we see you hungry thirsty naked and imprisoned and they say Lord but they could not recognize the Lord in the least of these his brethren God is going to sift and test Israel Amos chapter 9 I will shake you as one shakes corn in a sieve and not so much as one kernel shall fall to the ground I will sift you through all nations because it's not only the Jew that needs to be sifted but the nations themselves and the people who say gentlemen in the nations but are not able to show mercy to a people who will be universally despised hated and pursued and blamed for the collapse of everything in the modern world which collapses coming but the righteous will extend mercy they cannot help themselves their righteousness compels them when it will be no more convenient for them to extend mercy to the Jews who are the least of his brethren than it was for Corrie Ten Boom in her family 50 years ago then you'll be tested you who love the Hebraic choruses now and all of the Jewish and Hebraic resonance of worship and celebration what will that day reveal remember how assured that Peter was Lord though all the world deny you yet will I deny you never until the night of terror came and the one who made the loudest professions denied Jesus with oaths and cursings I don't know the man what shall we say we need not only to prepare physically for Jews in time of flight but spiritually to be able to bear the situation to make it known to sound the warning to be able to receive them not out of a sense of grim religious obligation but God says I will meet with you face to face but God says I will meet with you face to face they've got to see something more than religious obligation that holds its breath waiting for them to pass they've got to see the unconditional love of God under the most trying circumstances when they will be at their worst their least politeness their greatest irritation believing that they are again suffering a Christian crime they will be stretched to breaking and irritating and will not be grateful for your sacrifice and your risk what will that reveal the Lord said end time teaching center community refuge you know what I've come to realize you know what I've come to realize in 25 years no community, no refuge community is more than the casual accommodation or coming together of the saints community is more than the casual we are 25 or 30 of us living together on the same property I'm not their employer I'm only a brother with them but they're all difficult daily irritations and trials because God says in Romans through Paul that by your mercy they can obtain mercy and a woman cried out in the church years ago when I preached that Archie said we don't have mercy for each other how shall we have it for Jews only a community can bear the weight and the responsibility the impact of Jews in this condition because they have already had a history of bearing one another how does that appeal to your Dutch sense of privacy where you can be so joyous and pleasant on Sunday or the conference situation but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday the daily thing reveals the truth about condition and better that that truth should be revealed now while there's yet opportunity to alter it by the grace of God then we should reveal it to Jews whose only hope we will be in that last day Are we living in such a vital relationship with our fellow men now?

Are we ourselves touchy, vulnerable and easy to be irritated?

I'm reading from Oswald Chambers my utmost for his highest do you read him daily? selection for the day together with the psalm for the day the chapter from the book of Proverbs in your daily devotional time before you go off to business or attend to the family the issue of the last days for the church is the issue of its devotion because there's a young man that Satan has been seeking to destroy throwing him into the fire and into the water that he foams at the mouth with fits on the demonic manipulation and the disciples could not cast it out and Jesus said to the father how long has this been going on since childhood since its infancy since his birth as a people Satan has been out to destroy the Jew throwing him into the fire and into the water and he's coming into the earth and he knows his time is short not only to harass the Jew but so as to destroy him and the disciples could not cast it out and they were more spiritual than you they had walked with Jesus but they came to this ultimate test and had not the faith to deal with this ultimate demonic manifestation of the kind that is coming into all the world in the last days and will seek as its last activity the annihilation of the Jew will you be able to cast it out they took Jesus aside privately after he had delivered this child because when he commanded that demon to step out from him he shook him one last time like a rag doll and left him for dead and so it was not only a deliverance that was needed but also a resurrection and lifted him up this is beyond your present spirituality why could we not cast him out because this ultimate kind cometh not out but by prayer and fasting prayer beyond petition prayer that is communion that is in the presence of God frequently and obtained in the early morning hour in the cold draft on the floor in your little private devotional room in Holland a sense of God as God that is greater than all of the reality of evil and will overcome it God who is greater devotional these are hard words to consider and only the righteous will succeed in that day who are in communion with his risen life righteousness is not our correct behavior righteousness is the abiding reality of God who alone is righteous a pain in union and communion that we can bear his word because he has things to say that have been too hard for us we cannot bear it, he cannot reveal it we cannot get it until his life has had his way with us his risen life and then we understand there is a need for resurrection resurrection is the key to glory but it does not come from the death it does not come from the death that Jesus gave no, I do not understand Jesus himself could not escape escape from that obligation to undergo death the messiah must die before he ascends to his glory what then of Israel who is going to be an eternal glory for God a diadem, a necklace, a decoration a nation of priests who say of Jerusalem God is our righteousness a priestly nation ministering to all nations out of a brokenness required of sons who are chastened by the love of the Father there is a chastening coming must come may we be able to warn in advance of it may we be able physically to prepare for the receiving of them to reveal God's mercy not out of obligation but out of joy of revealing to this broken people the reality of their God that they might return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord let me pray for us Lord, if I am in error if I am raising up an unhappy speculation that will not come to pass one that we need not anticipate nor make any preparation because after all we think we are going to be raptured out before such a time then let this speaking this evening come to nothing let it be like a vapor that dissipates away let it be like a vapor that dissipates away but if it's true let the word haunt us bring us afresh into your scriptures where we will see the word devastation ruin, the land made desolate and the land that has become a desert the cities that are left without inhabitants the Jerusalem that will be rebuilt upon its own ruins the Jerusalem that will be rebuilt upon its own ruins open our eyes to see what you have prolifically described that we might be forewarned and give a warning to the naive and unsuspecting bring us of age to fulfill our destiny as a church that can be to Israel what it must when they shall become the least of these your brethren we shall not join the world in our disappointment that have failed Israel but receive them as the brethren of the Lord even in their sinful condition that they might be redeemed and meet God through our gentile faces that will not be irritated will not be disappointed will not be resentful but show the unconditional love of God the Father I bless this church Lord for a message as significant as this in a nation that has already shown itself heroically toward the Jew and will have yet one more occasion before the end comes Lord that the people are not unprepared because you have sent your word into the midst through a precious woman whose spirit was touched by a man of whom she had never heard and though she had been warned by others and the other speakers had found reason not to come still persisted in having him and calls him the man of God bless her for the salvation that shall come to a remnant of Israel for a door of utterance that has been opened this night out of this deepest faith and love watch over this word Lord to perform it let it be historic and we thank you and we give you the honor for taking the initiative coming into our midst and speaking to us as sons and daughters who can hear your hard word and in our deepest thoughts realize it is the truth and also perform it through the grace of God through the eternal praise and glory of your Lord in the name of Jesus, Amen
