The Holocaust as Judgment 2 of 3 - Art Katz

Well, blessed Lord, good evening Saints and those who are at the threshold of sainthood, needing a little divine nudge, which I trust the Lord will supply on an appropriate Shavuat occasion, the giving of the law and the Spirit. And for some of you tonight this word will be as the law.

It will befall on fresh virginal ears. You've never heard anything like this, conceptually. I'm waiting to hear it myself for a first time, never before having spoken it. And I never seem to get to it. That takes me so long to get through the introductions. But tonight I want to enter right in to the remarkable issue of covenant and covenant obligation, covenant blessing, covenant curse. This is intrinsic to our identity as Jews.

And as I say in this paper, the fact that we are ignorant of the same does not absolve us from our obligation.

Something happened at Sinai thousands of years ago that implicates us now.

Something was transacted that binds subsequent generations, even if we are ignorant of that transaction, yet are we still under the obligation of the things that were covenanted and understood.

The great pity is that we have not had men to teach us and to say so. And that we have not had shepherds who have been concerned for our souls.

But God said in the last days he would give us such shepherds.

And I pray tonight that that is in fact so. So Lord, we so want to hear from you.

We want to hear, my God, in a virginal way the law, the things that you have enacted, that you have established, which had we needed them, we would have not suffered, my God, the unspeakable calamities that have punctuated our Jewish history and threaten us still.

Obedience would have brought blessing and ignorance and rejection have brought curse.

So Lord, we're asking that for some here even tonight, that curse will be lifted and the presence of the living God come into a Jewish heart as to establish a joy unspeakable. The great mercy that has come to us who have resisted you and blasphemed you, come also now to others through the operation of your word and your spirit.

Come, my God, you know better than we how short the time is.

And we're asking the redemption of this time out of your great heart of mercy and love for us still.

Bless this night, Lord, make it memorable. We're not ashamed to say make it historic.

Sound something that will not end here but will reverberate far beyond and through this place, my God, so far as you will direct it. And we thank you for the privilege of these days and this occasion and this speaking.

Bless us together.

In Yeshua's holy name we pray and God's people said.

Amen.

Well, I sometimes pity those who have to hear me that I'm reminded of those last days two witnesses in the city of Jerusalem who torment those who dwell upon the earth, that when death finally comes to them they exchange gifts and they lie in the streets for three and a half days while all the earth and Jerusalem itself then which is like Sodom and Gomorrah, by the way we're speaking of a future event, and God describes that Jerusalem at that time as being as Sodom and Gomorrah, the city in which the Lord was crucified, it says, rejoicing for the death that has come to two prophetic men who torment them who dwell upon the earth.

I get a presentiment of that increasingly as I go on in the Lord. Some are blessed exceedingly and some are tortured. They want to stick their fingers in their ears and run away or gnash upon me with their teeth and I'm happy for that, that we're coming to an hour beyond sermons and the kinds of things that leave us relatively unaffected.

I'd rather have men gnash upon me with their teeth and fury and indignation than they should be God is requiring something by his word.

So I've got concepts tonight that I'm sure will be unfamiliar, strange, maybe offensive to them who may be hearing it for the first time and so I just invite you to bear with me.

For example, the first of these, so altogether incompatible with our individualistic modes of understanding is the biblical concept of corporate sin and responsibility. That God sees differently than ourselves and that he judges an entire people as a people, a whole people.

We Jews are implicated with our nation. Our individual life may be exceedingly virtuous. I doubt that.

We may think so, but nevertheless God sees us as incorporated with and sharing in the destiny of our own nation and that's why the great prophets when they cried out to God who were virtuous speak as if they share the sins of their nation.

We have sinned.

We have done wickedly and they mean that and our modern society does not lend itself to this kind of perception of reality as being corporate and for that reason even the church itself suffers.

I often describe the modern church as the conglomerate of individualities sharing a facility for the convenience of the moment, but not at all corporate or together. To be alongside one another in a pew does not make us together.

Together is an apostolic word that has more to do with physical proximity and likewise we need to bring ourselves into alignment with God's foot, with God's view because that alone is true. Imagine the horror of having to make such adjustment on the day of eternity when it's too late to remedy the enormous disparity between our seeing and his and we have pompously celebrated our view till that day and thought ourselves doing God's service and only to stand before him in that moment and to see as we are seen and to emit a shriek and a wailing, a gnashing of teeth that cannot be remedied because we did not see as he sees nor were our thoughts his thoughts. It's a mitzvah when God sends a prophet into our midst for his function who is a seer who sees as God sees is to bring God's people into alignment with that seeing.

I'll tell you what you think that's a snap?

If you are in alignment with God's seeing it will put you at painful disjuncture with the world and its seeing, its norms, its values, its wisdoms, its conventionalities and that is more of a reason why we balk at saying yes to the Lord than anything else. We cannot bring ourselves to forsake the approval of men and to be one of the boys and to stand out in offensive contradiction to the world and to its wisdom but I want to tell you it's a privilege hallelujah to see as God sees and to tie it in with this morning's message which if you were not here I commend the tape if we will not see as God sees nor shall we speak as he would have us to speak. You cannot be a prophetic proclaimer of the word if you do not first see as God sees and that's why before the Son of Man could prophesy to the dry bones of Israel that they might live he first had to be brought up and out and down and into the valley of dry bones by the hand of the Lord that was upon him and by God's Spirit. Even the prophet was reluctant to leave the orbit of more convenient seeing than to come down and to see as God sees in the grit of Israel's death but unless he was moved around and and had his face rubbed into that awesome reality he could not later speak to those bones. We have the first degree to see as God sees and I'll tell you what as we say in Brooklyn it waits.

It's painful seeing. Truth is painful before it's glorious. That's why you need to love it or God will abandon you to the spirit of deception. My first book was dedicated to my Jewish kinsmen who are seekers after truth more than convenience. God is still seeking such.

The Shema Yisroel which we so celebrate is not to protect us from Jesus but to recognize him. For God's sake hear O Israel the Lord your God is one Lord. Who then is this one who allows men to fall at his feet and cry out I don't know my Lord and my God and far from being rebuked are called blessed.

You have to be an absolute dumb dumb to sidestep the implications of that but in the day of eternity you'll be held accountable for that slippery maneuver. Okay see what I mean about my introduction. I can't get me into the subject.

Okay we need a different framework of understanding which is God's and the framework of understanding that is so essential to our proper perception of Israel and its predicament is the covenant relationship between Yahweh and Israel and that this necessary critical view is lost both to contemporary Jews and even to the church.

What would be an evidence of the loss of covenantal consciousness in the world today and even in the church. The frequency of divorce even to be found in the church. Isn't marriage of covenant unbreakable unto death do us part and even if the partner goes berserk and off the wall or runs out with other men or whatever we are still under a covenantal obligation.

Boy there's something about me that is so persistent and after 31 years of many temptations to bark and flee and abandon and call it hopeless and irremediable I'm beginning to see the grace of God turning who honors covenantal obligation and faithfulness. The frequency of our divorces and our remarriages even in the church is the symptom of the lightness with which we have regarded the subject of covenant. How then can we turn to our Jewish kinsmen and call them to their obligation with whom the first and and the continuing covenants are required. If we ourselves hold this remarkable thing in so little regard covenantal things are heavenly.

Men could not have invented it. It comes down from above. God gives it. He's the creator and the end. He's also the keeper.

So this view has been lost to us and what needs to be asked is whether covenant is still in force in terms of its penalties and whether its stipulations are binding.

At what point does it become abrogated and null and void and my point is it doesn't.

A covenant made is still in effect and if we have not received its benefit and its blessings by obedience to its terms we are under the penalty of its curses.

The absence of blessing is curse. I don't want to you know that we hear the word curse we sound we think of something like voodoo or shrieking or catcalls or some bizarre form of curse I know it takes that forms but think of it in terms of the absence of blessing is curse. Oh to be blessed of the Lord. Oh to receive his benediction. Oh to be under his overarching care and protection and keeping power. We would have been saved the gas ovens. We would have been saved having our blood spilled in the streets of Germany in the 15th century in every Easter occasion when the cry of Christ killer went up and Jews barricaded themselves in their houses not always successfully.

We were without the benign benevolent protection of God for we were out of covenantal keeping and so what is likewise joined to the concept of a whole responsibility to stand with a people in God's view is this issue of solidarity in sin that past and future generations are seen by God as joined in a collective accountability and I quote here from a German theologian isn't remarkable that the German theologians are the most insightful in Old Testament scholarship and this dear brother writes in his theology of the Old Testament that the prophets bring not only their own contemporaries before God's judgment and denounce them for the rebellion but also see them linked with all previous generations in a unitary entity for which the sins of the fathers are also the sins of those now alive and will be required of them. I don't have the time now to find it for you you can do your own homework but I believe that in Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 God says that when you will acknowledge the sins of your fathers as your own and that the judgments which they have received are altogether just and righteous then I will turn and remember my covenant towards you. What needs to be pressed upon Jewish consciousness is that thousands of years after the events because time means nothing for God it's only a human convenience God sees always in the eternal now we are linked with our people in their sins. The sins of our fathers are our sins and the fact that we have not issued a disclaimer and broken that connection by the repudiation of their sin means that we share in it and the consequence of it.

Can you follow that?

This is God's thought and I have the obligation to communicate it you have the obligation to receive it completely contrary to every juridical view of modern society about human individual and personal accountability. I have nothing to do with that I was born after the fact I have nothing to do with the crucifixion of Jesus. God says you do because you never ever broke your unspoken union with those who did crucify him and your silence is your indictment.

Oh I've had experiences saints. Can I take a few hours tonight in London at some college meeting where the Lord gave me the message Jesus or Barabbas?

Prophets are always at the threshold of insanity they're in a time dimension seeing the future as now and the past as alive that makes them so strange for the present and my message that night was that you're under obligation now 2,000 years later to choose Barabbas or Jesus.

That was not just a once-in-upon-a-time alternative offer to those who are alive in that moment.

Every subsequent generation makes that choice consciously or not and there was a woman squirming in her seat she couldn't bear a word that I was speaking and finally at the end of it I gave an invitation in my insanity to choose Jesus or Barabbas as if the issue were alive and current now because that which is past is now and God requires that which is past and so here and there very little people got up and prayed and before I could go further this woman had launched out of her seat and was into my face and she was wagging her finger I'm Jewish she said my father's a rabbi and I know an actor when I see one and she was berating me up one side and down the other and I'm just taking it in my accustomed patience letting her ventilate herself but over her shoulder I can see a man trembling like a leaf in the corner of the room I'm invisibly trembling and I made a motion and the believers who were with him brought this man up and in the hearing of this woman I said what happened to you he said Artie said I chose Jesus and not Barabbas and the moment that I did he said the Spirit of God came into me and I said to this woman you're going to leave murmuring under your breath and indignant at this actor but you missed a moment of choice that needs to be made and in your indignation and your leaving you affirm the decision of your fathers for which we have suffered ever since and will undoubtedly be a factor in your own suffering you know we need to see as God sees who stands above time and when you go on as I have gone on with the Lord for 31 years you know you begin to realize nothing has changed every issue then is the issue now oh our clothing may be different our style our mode of speech but the essential and the eternal questions remain who do you say that I am still remains as a pressing pointed question that affects our whole eternity and our failure to give answer is an answer our silence is a condemnation so we need to see the sins of the fathers as our own and those that will be required of us as of them and that our return requires the seeing this acknowledgement so that we remain in an unbroken continuum with our forebears continuing in and perpetuating their sin as our own until we come to a repentant acknowledgement of that past forsaking its sins which alone saves us from the deadly consequence for our own future that's what repentance is repentance is an acknowledgement that our fathers blew it that a historic decision was made that was tragic in its rejection that Jesus himself wept in the knowledge of it that we did not know the day of our visitation who could see by his divine omniscience what would be the consequence of that rejection for every subsequent generation how costly is the rejection of God in the form in which God presents himself and the consequence goes on still so there's no magical abrogation of sin but rather over the course of time there's a cumulative obligation and debt you know what happens when you don't make your payments it increases and then multiplies becomes exponential and becomes of such a kind that it finally eventuates in a Holocaust and we think that because the judgment and the curse comes 2,000 years after the event that there's some kind of dissonance or disjuncture between the cause and the effect that's only because we're men and we think that if God prolongs and withholds the necessary judgment that the judgment when it comes is unrelated to the sin for which the judgment comes the passage of time does not in any way alter the causal connection between sin and judgment but we are so removed from the origins of the sin 2,000 years later that it doesn't occur to us that the magnitude of our suffering is related to the magnitude of our transgression when God gave me the Holocaust message for the first time in 1977 I think it was spoken out of five days of fasting one of the statements that he gave me to say was we didn't die because we were Jews we died because we were not Jewish enough so no matter how long deferred however compounded by the passage of time and neglect God's judgments inevitably come if that were not so God would not be righteous and if he defers it's because he's not willing that any should perish and he stretches himself and he and he extends his mercy and he sends his messages rising up early who are stoned by those to whom they come and finally when every other grace is exhausted and men cannot be instructed by the word he instructs them by their events and when they will not be instructed by the event what shall the envy when we still come out smelling like a rose and find a way to remove the onus of the meaning of the Holocaust and not see it in terms as the consequence of our national sin and I'm not just talking about the crucifixion of Jesus as if this is some kind of isolated event in itself the crucifixion of Jesus is a consummation of a longer history of apostasy and alienation from God finally brought to such a pitch after such a history of the rejection of God and his word that when the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we were not only unable to recognize him but were offended by him and nothing could placate us but his death and his elimination that is the tragic sin of Israel well it's interesting how history supports this Jewish history itself as I may have mentioned in the first night with about the Eichmann trial the great architect of a systematic annihilation of the Jews and under Nazism was finally brought to trial 15 years after the conclusion of World War two or the famous Nazi hunter what is his name and men like him would not give up they were relentless in their pursuit it is remarkable like the dogged determination to finally get this man and others like him and bring him to justice 15 years after the event I probably would have said oh you know let bygones be bygones I mean the guys probably got one foot in the grave some of these men were executed in their late 80s but we would not absolve them of their obligation for justice they were criminals and here's what the prosecuting eternity of Israel had to say about that case it may well take some time before a criminal is brought to justice in Eichmann's case it took 15 years since he had gone into hiding but he was ultimately found exposed to the obloquy of mankind and executed then comes the statement neither the passage of time nor the distance of asylum saved him these facts are worth bearing in mind you know what I say amen but you dear man you don't know what you were saying because by that statement you have indicted Israel itself the passage of time and distance does not save us there comes a day of judgment the day of reckoning when we have to pay and these facts are worth bearing in mind and if we'll not pay them before the day of eternity we will pay them in the day of eternity and if we only knew what eternity means without God of the fire that shall not be quenched of the eternal anguish that is without remedy if we only knew hell as we ought to know hell as a people who are heavenly and know the eternal alternatives we would have been warning our Jewish brethren much more fervently than we do but we have not wanted to offend them oh they're so nice to be nice is not to save to be saved from hell if I can paraphrase the scriptures there's no man nice no not one no man good there's not a righteous one upon the face of the earth who can stand before God our iniquity is ever before us and if we have not come into his righteousness in this life how shall we stand his presence thereafter and God who knows the unspeakable anguish of an eternal separation from God how many of us have been embarrassed and felt the blood rush to our heads and such a relief when that moment of embarrassment passes we were burning how would you like an eternity in which it does not pass and the shame of your sinful rejection of God despite the pleadings and the entreaties and the endearments and the and the men and the messengers and every kind of thing that God had put before you did not avail and now it's too late for anything to avail and all of the memory of the witnessing and the people who spoke and shared and whom you heard and what you've read comes back to you recall too late to act there's a finality about the day of eternity that needs to be registered upon our souls and rightly did the great evangelist then he say that when the church loses its sense of hell it will have lost its distinction as the church and we have lost it we're not living in the light of eternity or the anticipation of it and we're unable to warn men but God knows it and I'll tell you that when everything else fails he sends his judgments not only in fulfillment of his righteous indignation and wrath for sins that that justly deserve that reckoning but in the hope also that if nothing else have has waked us from out the deception of our self-righteousness and what we are suffering will I think the great valid question that should rightly have come out of the Holocaust is this what have we conceivably done for what sins are we rightly assessed that this suffering the magnitude of the suffering has come upon us what is the magnitude of our sin that justifies the magnitude of this suffering has got to take us back throughout the ages to the inceptions of our sin and it was calculated the judgment to that very purpose and end instead if we will not see our sins as the root of our suffering you know who invariably is brought into the dock and accused and put under witness stand and held accountable for explanation if we Jews are too virtuous to see in ourselves a sin that would justify such consequence then it's God himself in the dock how come and where were you and what kind of a God are you isn't remarkable how we have a much greater facility to find fault with God and with ourselves and if we needed any more evidence of our sin let that be sufficient the God who is righteous in all that he does he cannot help himself that's what he is he does all things well he's perfect in all his ways let every man be a liar let God be true if God brings judgment of God brings catastrophe if God brings holocausts no we don't understand them our first question ought to be what is the sin in us and not what is the sin in you even to dare to presume to raise a question like that against God shows what our lamentable condition is so the Messiah's death is only the culmination of a longer standing apostasy attested by God through the prophets but who of us have read them and then remarkable how many years I went to Hebrew school to be bar mitzvah I never heard anything about the prophets or by the prophets and in fact my bar mitzvah performance was the incantation and the chanting of a prophetic portion of which I did not understand nor was I instructed in the meaning of a single syllable but to bring it with proper inflection with the rising and falling of the voice that my mother should cry copious tears was the whole purpose of that religious thing for which I spent years in the preparation I know do you guys understand me I'm not deprecating Judaism Jewish life religious practices I ache I ache I can't recall how many years later is it over 50 years later 53 years later that there was ever the word God ever mentioned in the way that he was solemnly to be considered or that he could be known or that he that we should understand that he's a creator or that he has something to do with our history out calling us a people I was only prepared for a ceremony we don't know the prophets and I remember not long ago visiting in Phoenix there's a synagogue there that was giving a Thursday lecture every week and the lecture that week was on the prophets of Israel well I'd heard another lecture in Saint Paul not far from me in Minnesota where an Orthodox Jew with a yarmulke on his head and his van dyke beard said that the prophets of Israel were Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud and the great social crusaders for justice were the prophets of God talk about wanting to puke we're ignorant folks and God says for the want of knowledge my people perish and so then in Phoenix this rabbi gave a pretty good review of the lamentable cry of God through the prophets to Israel how many of us who complain about the New Testament being anti-semitic have ever read the book of Isaiah or Jeremiah or Ezekiel God has things to say about us and our condition in those books that make the the momentary references in the New Testament look like a Boy Scout outing from the top of your head to the soles of your feet you're laden with saws that need to be mollified and bound up the ass knows its owner and the the the the ox its master's crib but my people do not know and they do not consider oh sinful nation laden with iniquity from the top of your heads to the soles of your feet the city of righteousness has become a city of murderers your wine is turned to water your silver to dross and what has happened since to alter our condition so this rabbi gave this dissertation in a much lighter way than I would have but sufficient to indicate God has a controversy with us and then there was a question-and-answer period you know the kind where you arrive in your seat there you as you listen to the most innocuous beats of nothing being spoken funny I raised my hand with trembling and I was recognized and I said dear sir can you tell me when it is historically or when it was that we as a people have ever acknowledged the indictment that has come to us through the prophets when have we ever acknowledged what God has said is our condition through those whom he has sent rising up early how then can we even remedy what we don't even know to be true our ignorance has been costly we have as a nation not answered that indictment we indeed have never even heard it and in fact if it were to be expressed I'm afraid that the one who would be expressing it would clearly and readily be indicted as being anti-semitic are you willing to suffer that reproach are you willing to suffer that misunderstanding is your love for Israel that great and you will tell Israel their sins and their transgressions and spare not and and blow the trunk knowing that you're going to be misunderstood and that you're going to be accused of being anti-semitic unloving or you just want to be nice I'll tell you that the issue of Israel is not Israel they're in they're incapable of helping themselves and will become increasingly so until they're totally inept unto death the issue is the church its conduct its action its witness its love its compassion its speaking but not only are we Jews outside the perspective of the prophets and the Deuteronomic covenantal blessings or curses choose you this day life or death we're outside the biblical view all together we're outside of biblical understanding we're secular minded and we're outside of the of God seeing we can't even examine our calamities in his light and therefore we can either blame Hitler determined people or God and I'm not absolving Hitler and determined people they will have their comeuppance for their implication and their ready availability to be the rod of God's chastisement but what is the church's function is it not this to bring to secular and unbelieving mindsets the biblical perspectives of God because if men will not consider them in this life they will have to consider them in the day of eternity when it will be too late that's only a shrink says in her wonderful way in the day of eternity she said all values will be reversed all I can say to that is why they what we thought was like will then be revealed for what it is darkness for what we thought was value will be revealed for what it is shabby pathetic nothingness what we rejected blasphemously will be revealed as holy too late then to make any adjustment or change fixed in that state same resolute rejection that has brought us right to our graves I've argued with my own nephew in London whose marriage has since gone down the tube pleading for his salvation and he says with a with a nonchalance well if I got to go to hell with the others there'll be plenty of company there and I can take it and that without remedy and remember the day that God pled with you and sought to turn you and you would not and God says of us that we resist him who smote us and we refuse to consider and refuse to hear we have turned on X we have cast his word over our shoulders we have stoned his prophets and when the Sun himself came we sought to his execution also some at lunchtime today someone said why the Jew why why are we so central to all this is there something about us more perverse than others no it's just that we're all we're human all too human we're more human than you are we're larger than life we're rip large but it's our humanness our human condition our statement of our humanity that should forewarn men everywhere and God has got to use us as the witness people to demonstrate himself not by our virtue but by our vice that he's there both the God of judgment but he's the God also of restoration and that the age ends with a new covenant made in his blood which we are not even expected to keep by our own religious ability that's why it's called everlasting he knows we'll never again blow it because he's not depending upon us to keep it our failure is too well known by him he himself will keep it in us and through us in a new covenant by the blood of the lamb listen to the Saints you want to get something conceptual the inability to recognize calamity as judgment is not only grievous in the sense that we are bewildered and left without explanation for our sufferings and will ultimately blame God as well as men but it also prevents us from believing God for restoration can you follow that that because we have not believed the words of the prophets of the judgments that would come and have not seen the judgments as the fulfillment of his word in Leviticus and Deuteronomy remember what Elie Wiesel said when my first night I refused to consider that then you will be equally incapable of considering God's promise of restoration in the last days the faith and the believing in the God who speaks judgment is required for the faith and the believing in the God who speaks restoration and we can't have the one without the other and what can enable us to believe when the bottom will fall out let me be a false prophet let it not come true but I believe that it will that before our eyes have closed on this generation maybe even before the conclusion of this decade we're going to see devastation to Jews on a world scale that will eclipse the Nazi time who could have expected it who could have imagined in the land of the red white and blue and apple pie and mother and the Cleveland Indians that such things could happen here who could have thought they could have happened in Germany in the land of Gerda Schiller fixed the Hegel Nietzsche Schopenhauer Wagner Mozart Beethoven what then of us Johnny come lately whose culture is as shallow and as thin as tissue paper when the demonic force is released in fury will go down like the proverbial deck of cards every high school dropout now and every punk kid who's seething with rebellion against this generation and is without artifice or ability and needs something to ventilate his his fury and his his emptiness and will be a candidate for the to be the victimizers of the helpless in that day we're producing a whole generation that will be without conscience without natural affection and will be brutal and despises of that which is good and they will do the number on my people and it will come suddenly how can the people then be knocked back and forth from pillar to post uprooted losing everything in the day having to flee with what is on their back not knowing where they're going be told that don't worry your God will save you your God is coming he will vindicate you this is a process of last-day sifting Amos spoke about it Ezekiel spoke about it and now it's being called for but hang in God will see he'll bring you through this and you return as the redeemed of the Lord to Zion and mourning and sighing will flee away and everlasting joy will be upon your heads and if you don't believe that how will you make it till that time because that good is going to come a time when faith will be itself a life-and-death matter and that's what saved men in the Holocaust and in the concentration camps those who had some kind of faith some kind of something to hold on to that which was inward some hope some expectation whether it was religious or spiritual not survived but those who had not that perished they were zombies they went down like like cut timber because they had no inward thing to sustain them the issue of believing the God who says I will restore you suffered double for your sins but I will restore will be the issue of the people believing that the same God who spoke judgment and has fulfilled it in our experience is the same God who will fulfill restoration because the God who speaks in his promise is the God who answers can you follow that to believe the God who promised judgment and fulfilled it painfully is the God who also promises restoration and will fulfill it because he's the same God who fulfills what he speaks and what he promises to not believe God's judgment as the fulfillment of his word is to nullify all hope in believing for his future intervention in mercy in fact that God should intervene at all in the affairs of men is an offense to the liberal mind we don't like a God who intervenes and in fact I would say that's not only true of Jews that's true a lot of Christians we would much rather see the desert bloom as a rose through an irrigation project then God himself should sovereignly do it supernatural there's something about us that flinches and winces at the supernaturalness of God that we are more humanistic than we know that's why our witness to our Jewish people has been so weak because we share their essential humanistic mindset thinly gilded over with subscription to Christian doctrine we have not believed in the supernatural God who speaks and performs and who is coming in the last days in his own person and preceding that he's going to intervene in the history he's going to bring judgments that even the unbelieving nations will recognize because they shall also see his mercy as visited upon Israel that not a nation shall stand before him with excuse he's not going to do this in the corner he's not going to hide this they will all be responsible for the visible demonstration of God's judgment and mercy has been executed before their eyes on the people Israel I will bring them back he says it's gonna be a little different than the Zionist return I will bring them back your sons and your daughters will return on stretches and on mules and on their backs and shoulders of kings and queens I will restore you I'll bring you back from the farthest places where you have been dispersed and whereunto I have driven you what are we going to believe God and not circumstance he's going to demonstrate himself and it's a final demonstration and that the nations will not receive that you'll receive his judgments also his judgment begins with the house of God but it doesn't end there so to believe that all that God can intervene in the affairs of men is an ultimate offense to the liberal mind determined even now to obtain its own deliverance through its own efforts that's what we have in Perez and Robin humanists of an ultimate kind through negotiations through skullduggery through Oslo agreements through something with PLO with Arafat we're going to affect peace and how quick the world is to award them with the Nobel Prize or whatever it was as if the thing were accomplished because it's contractual God calls it a covenant with death it was well soon enough now go from making it with Arafat to make it with Satan himself when he comes as Antichrist anything but turning to God for our security for our salvation for our deliverance man inveterate man trying by his own skullduggery and wit to establish the conditions of his life and not turning to his God and offended even with the thought that God himself is even capable of intervening or that he should well he sure intervened this morning I wish you had been here there wasn't enough of me to pick up with a blotter I got out of bed in a ridiculous posture I was lurching like a drunken man I was beside myself I was so utterly weak and bereft of thought and ability I thought Lord what a pitiful condition to be in at a crucial time of delivering of significant messages and I had thought to speak this and that but I sat there waiting to be called upon not knowing what and when I got up and opened my mouth God had other intentions all together he intervened he came in he pre-empted my intention and gave a delivery of something calculatedly on time that was precious I'm accustomed to the interventions of God I live by those interventions I welcome them he's a living God and only the Elijah's of God know that in an age of apostasy when the world is gone who ring after false Gods they can confront the Ahab's of this world and say as the Lord my God lives before whom I stand can you say that saints are you willing to be put in the place where you will learn to say that where your dependency is not on your job and your income and on circumstances and on man but and God are you willing to live in 40 below zero winters in Minnesota with your tongue hanging out living beneath the marginal poverty that even the United States declares as being minimal with 55 souls with pregnant women are you willing for that or the equivalent of that that you might know him as he as he deserves to be known to go beyond mere doctrinal subscription to the knowledge of God as he in fact is and must be known in order to be made known why have we failed so much with our Jewish kinsmen because we don't know him as we ought and therefore we cannot communicate him beyond a few cliches God has a plan for your life for spiritual laws of course we added a fifth for Jews we need one more the knowledge of God is expensive but precious that you can say as the Lord my God lives the God who when I was discombobulated and couldn't put two thoughts together took over he intervened and if you can intervene with kid cats in what condition and circumstance can he not intervene and he's going to intervene for Israel when we are down and out when we are in our graves when we are the slain of Israel and when we ourselves acknowledge we are cut off we are without hope years dry bones and acknowledgement we have never made even at the Holocaust God will turn to a prophetic people and say speak to those bones that they might live he's going to intervene and it's the final revelation of himself before his actual coming and he'll be the king of his creation to give any other hope for Israel is to give a false hope to encourage Israel in any other encouragement is to give a false encouragement to our God and to his word and to his promise and to his deliverance is the message of the church and we need to even bear up with the offense that the Word of God has caused the New Testament references with the Jewish community thinks has been the the motivating power of anti-semitism and ventuated in the Holocaust and if only we would excise out those references then the New Testament might be permissible you know what it means to excise out the Word of God from the Word of God is to crucify the Son of God afresh not content with having crucified the Word made flesh now we want to cut out also the Word of God and we find offensive in our unregenerate secular rational minds and there are a lot of saps who agree with them Christian saps who agree with this interpretation of the Holocaust that somehow it's got to do with some defect in Christendom and in the New Testament rather than in the cumulative sin of the people itself so where are the prophets now who would communicate such things the causal connection between Israel's historic apostasy and her sufferings to a generation that chooses not to know I'll tell you the church that can do that for the Jew what nation and what nationality what ethnic group will in any way to them be a threat or an intimidation to communicate these prophetic things to the Jewish community will make the proclamation of the gospel to the Greek far more effectual and that's why God says to the Jew first and also to the Greek stop don't go out into the countryside and see if you can raise it up the flagpole like some play and then you take it to New York City start in Jerusalem where I was crucified where the prophets were stoned then go to Judea and Samaria then to the other most corners of the world start with them who are the clear and conspicuous enemies of the gospel for your sake we needed that we needed some tough intellectual resistant Jewish people who were not satisfied with a few cliches they need a powerful presentation of the reality of God in word and indeed and that's why God has them in that condition for our sake I'll tell you there'll be another kind of church if we could beat it to the Jew what we want the Greeks will be the beneficiaries so where are the prophets now the consequences of covenantal dereliction as curse may be deferred and that tends to blur that there's a causal connection but it does not obliterate it it does not remove it is present jury still under the indictment of covenantal failure what has happened to nullify the continuing validity of that has the spirit of the people appreciably changed how are we more qualified now as Jews for what we were rejected for then the God who is the same yesterday and today forever is looking upon the people who are the same yesterday today forever our condition has not altered we're still under the indictment and still under the obligation of covenantal of responsibility and curse except that that is broken by repentance and the forsaking of the sins of our fathers and our own to bestow upon a later generation what was denied the former to say that present-day Jews are somehow different from and other than those upon whom God's judgments fell or who are held accountable by God for covenantal failure is to presumptuously annul that judgment as being invalid and in fact to annul God we need to see as God sees the mere passage of time has offered nothing the issues remain and God yet waits and has a controversy with his people and the time is running up it assumes erroneously that what we divinely appropriate and ancient or biblical times is somehow inappropriate and unthinkable now as for example the God of wrath and judgment well that was okay in 586 BC in the destruction of Jerusalem with a Babylonian captivity or 70 AD or 135 AD in the Roman conquest of Israel and Jerusalem but now I mean come on get with it cats these are modern times this is the age of liberal thought and the enlightenment well dear Saints I want to stand on this ground that God is the same yesterday today and forever and that the God of wrath and fury and judgment then is God now and will again express his wrath in fury and judgment before the age ends and I want to save every one of my Jewish kinsmen out of that and bring them into the arc of safety now and into the Messiah and back into the covenant for blessing and protection of the covenant by encouraging them to repent of the independent self will and notions and opinions and surrender before the Holy one of Israel while you can what a shock when we will learn that God has not changed that is quite capable of fury and wrath still and be unprepared for that demonstration our own our own sense of these things as the church has been dulled in deferring to Israel sense of herself as a victim rather than the causative agent in the end the omnipotence omniscience and sovereignty of God will fall victim to a time lose week God rejecting view of causation as attributed to men circumstance and accident we will take the modern view we will understand circumstances and convulsions and earthquakes isn't it interesting that the one in Kobe Japan was to the day one year after the one in California where the principal vortex and epicenter of that earthquake was in the place where the pornographic films are made and that Kobe was the city that Japan celebrated as being earthquake proof by human ingenuity and their got brought in convulsions devastating judgment how many would recognize an earthquake as something more than an accidental geological thing and the express will of very God himself to awaken nations from their sleep that there's a living God who needs to be acknowledged before the end comes I know with whom I shared this but I've had the privilege of being in Japan several times where has this Jewish boy not been in God's service in the nations Indonesia and Singapore and Czechoslovakia and you name it Egypt many times and I said at a minister's conference in Osaka just across the river from Kobe I said if you men think that Hiroshima and Nagasaki the atom bombing of those cities was near political and military judgments made by men you've got another think coming God may have employed men in the military decisions but it was the expression of his judgment for a God rejecting nation that has not even the word sin in its Japanese vocabulary and Shintoism is nothing more than some state function that serves to establish a status quo and keep men from the knowledge of the truth and if you'll not receive the fire of Nagasaki in Hiroshima and repents you will receive a fire that shall not be quenched that eclipses anything that can come from men from above and a pastor leaped out of his seat with all of the Japanese reputation for saving face he was beside himself and he cried out God he said make me a prophet for my nation you know what the church and the nations ought to be that agency that interprets the events of the history and current events of a nation as coming not from men but from God as warning and turning to the knowledge of him and not accent God says I will punish you yet times for your sins and that will be all the more for the testimony of past judgments which we as a Jewish nation have refused to consider shouldn't the unhappy resemblance of Israel's present worsening moral and spiritual condition to the generation that was judged be at least the cause for caution for concern for warning shouldn't we get a little and see to see that there's a daily degradation of life in Israel in what was intended as a nation that would be demonstrate to the world the uniqueness of Jewish virtue every day being degraded every day morally more compromised every day more and more scandal in the realm of politics and finance and and even the Orthodox and the love of the youth for films of horror that showed disembowelings and amputations alive and it becomes a morbid fetish and a collector's item and this Department of Education is concerned I got it right in my paper I quote from the Jerusalem Post in which the men in discussion said this is the statement of a sick society shouldn't the fact that Israel has not become what we had hoped for and is becoming increasing like the world and worse than the world more blatant more more what's aggressive in its demonstration of things that they think hit and the more with it more God more willing to do the things that are bizarre more willing to do the things that are unconscionable indicate that indeed there has been no fundamental change and that the judgment of God that was intended for an earlier generation hangs over the heads of a present one of whom God says your sins in the end shall be worse even than your fathers the torture of prisoners as I mentioned the other day in the justification that the general I forgot what they call this thing comparable to the CIA in America is legally allowed to use a certain amount of physical pressure using it now to a degree where men die under it and the nation does not protest because of the expediency of extracting from such men under torture confessions and information that would save them from the bombing of another bus where innocence will go up in pieces you understand what I'm saying since God has set in motion if you see God as omnipotent sovereign all together in charge of all that's happening and unfolding something he has set in motion a set of circumstances for a people who have prided themselves in their moral sensitivity to come to a place where they justify torture and have made a hero of the man who went into the mosque there at Hebron and shot up and killed over 31 Palestinians in prayer and maimed numbers of others people make pilgrimages to his grave today as a hero of a man who is both a doctor erudite secular and brilliant and orthodox who did not wince at cold blooded murder in somehow some thinking something to be expedient and it advantageous to the purposes of the nation I want to tell you that as a Jew who's 66 years old this was totally unthinkable in my generation unthinkable we would rather have suffered death and we should ever inflict violence unthinkable it's not an alternative it's not an expediency that we could ever employ no matter what but we're employing it how come because God wants to show us that what his word says is true there's not a righteous man upon the face of the earth that doeth good and sin is not and if God with a mark who can stand so why should we be surprised that do we Jews have some intrinsic virtue is God's assessment of the human condition altered has he changed his mind about what he says man's condition is is a Jew something other than man are we exempt from his assessment are we not the very epitome and the demonstration of what is the human condition independent of God God says in Jeremiah why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding I looked up the word perpetual in Webster's dictionary and it means never ceasing continuing forever in future time continuing or continued without intermission uninterrupted permanent fixed without intermission without limitation that was our condition then what's our condition now perpetual until God himself changes it and gives us a new nature like unto his own that salvation the world doesn't need to see some groovy Jewish nation that has in its own prowess and ability resuscitated a dead liturgical language and it become one of the great military powers on earth with nuclear detergent in a half century it needs to see a people who are lamb like and reveal and live in an act in the character of their God and bless in that way all the families of the earth I loved the Paul who called for the elders of the church at Ephesus at the conclusion of his apostolic career and they came he calls they came and they didn't hop onto a jet they came laboriously and painfully and they met him and he said you'll see my face no more but remember he said that from the commencement of my ministry to the end I'd never withheld from you the whole council of God in public places and from house to house I gave you the whole council of God I did not withhold they knew what kind of a man he was and you know what manner of man I was and when he said that they would see his face no more they weapons and went down on their knees and come through his neck and prayed that they would see his face no more tell me when Gentiles have ever related to a Jew like that because this was more than a Jew more than a Pharisee this was a transcendent man this was the citizen of heaven this was a man who had the unconditional love for the Goyim that we Jews can barely spit out that word with contempt and love them like a father and brooded over them jealously that Christ be formed in them and did not withhold himself can you imagine a nation like that we do err because we know not the scriptures know the power of God and if you would know what Israel's millennial destiny is to bless all the families of the earth when it comes into its own apostolate and come into the nations and bless the Gentiles as Paul did who was the apostle to the Gentiles though he was the most conversant in the things pertaining to Judaism because he said I'm a man born out of time and out of joint what you see in me is a foreshadowing of the nation's apostolic calling when God will have raised it from the dead I'll tell you what for such a calming is that and such a glorious that every suffering is worthwhile every judgment is necessary to bring this down and out to our own puny human Jewish consideration and bring us to a place that men will be blessed because we're sent of God in the power of God and in the character of God God didn't call us to impress he called us to bless and we can only bless out of the power of his life but ours has to go first strange you didn't know that it's the same basis by which we were called to live and be and serve and have our being but of course what have we done we've made resurrection only a doctrine and have not the faith to believe that we are called to live in it well I'll tell you this since unless we ourselves as a church come to that ground will not be worth of being to Israel unless we can speak to those dry bones in resurrection power and authority they remain in their grave we better start moving from the approval of doctrine of resurrection as a doctrine to the appropriation of resurrection as life and it ain't going to be easy there'll be some painful dying in between I don't know of any single message more resisted by the church than what I'm now describing can you take much more and they're running out of time so I bring this to a close let me let me see how I can end this about this perpetual backsliding that the passage of time does not alter this disposition of this people that our history has demonstrated that we presently demonstrate from our youth even to this day we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God as in Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 25 a commentary famous commentary says those who have changed their position have not changed the disposition modern times has not changed anything the disposition is fixed its man and only God can change that that's why he would have all men to be converted it's not the Christianity that was seeking to bring Jews to be converted but to God and to the life and character of God which alone is righteous anything else stinks only acknowledge fine and equity God cries out in Jeremiah chapter 3 goes unheard right up to the time of the Millennium when they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord neither shall they walk anymore after the imagination of their evil heart verse 17 direct Jeremiah chapter 3 shows that right up till the time that we by the conversion that has come by the grace of God called Jerusalem the throne of God right till that moment God describes our heart as yet being evil thou has stricken them but they have not grieved thou has consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces hotter than a rock they have refused to return little wonder that when we shall see him whom we have pierced the only way that will be able to mourn is that there's a spirit first poured out upon us the spirit of supplication and prayer for how else are we even capable of breaking and mourning before him whom we have pierced except God give us that ability and that grace he's all in all saints of him through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever I'll be his fool again and again and again I'll be weak I'll be discombobulated I'll be totally disoriented only let God be God let him show his people that the speaking that they're hearing is not some human contrivance that the voice is not a Brooklyn accent that there's something in the man and through the man that is not the man that is God himself and that this is the faith and anything less than other than this is outside the faith and dishonors and does disservice to God nothing has changed and I'm wondering if God has allowed Israel to be established in 1948 not to prove look on no hands what we have done in 40 years nuclear detergent number one Air Force third greatest military power on the earth with a with a nation of only four million but that God has allowed the Israel of 1948 to give us enough rope to hang ourselves and to demonstrate finally and at last and irretrievably that we are no different morally or spiritually than we have ever been or can be and that he's given us this demonstration to show us that except God be God we perish and we are not different from other men and we have nothing to offer men so that is our calling to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world so you say how do you know that a change has not come but give him a chance I mean it's only 50 years when a change comes it will come with a changed attitude toward the crucified one the continuing rejection of him bespeaks the unchanged condition that remains and despite the judgments despite the Holocaust despite even growing up in exile which of us kids in Brooklyn New York who played stickball in the streets ever thought that that was a judgment I didn't know what it Israel meant I want to have some remote connection with some land of shepherds and and palm trees and and and desert Brooklyn the asphalt jungle the strike zone on the on the apartment building where we played stickball this was my life this was natural this was real in this I'll make my success and this I'll make my name not ever understanding that to be born in Brooklyn or Moscow or Cleveland or Hollywood or Los Angeles is a judgment it's to our shame and not to our honor and that the very word synagogue is Greek and was born out of our exilic judgment cast out of the nation and here we are celebrating it and even trying to emulate and take from it certain things that would make our services more fetching I won't touch it with a ten-foot pole it's the statement of our indictment and our judgment the word itself is Greek and worldly and if our exile has not instructed us in the judgments of God and what shall we be instructed if we have turned the statement of our shame to be the statement of our glory and had become the Steven Spielberg's and and the the masters of entertainment and business and finance in exile what has God to do but to bring us to a time of Jacob's trouble where what we thought was a pillow becomes a stone and we find that even in America as we did in Germany we cannot come to a place of rest and safety and prosperity without again being hunted pursued and driven unto death so God says the last days are coming out of Jeremiah 9 when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh Egypt Judah Edom I'm on mob and all who live in the desert in distant places for all these nations are really uncircumcised even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart when are the penalties of the broken covenant abrogated avoided because the blessings have been lost that we exempt from the penalty there's the passage of time dissipate or or swage them even whether we consider covenant is valid does that affect God's disposition even if we don't respect him and honor them does that in any way change God's view this generation is under his wrath and it's coming this there are things yet unrequited that would will be required God requires that which is passed and since the day of your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have sent you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them yet they harken not unto me nor inclined the ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathers is God's final indictment against us in conditions that are yet future so God by this testimony brings the past into the present unto this day he says in that unbroken continuum of sin and for what reason should we dismiss this divine logic the outburst of Stephen before his own first martyrdom was as your fathers did so do you also you do always grieve the Holy Spirit of God that was a true statement that men couldn't bear to hear and put their fingers in their ears and rushed upon him and urged upon him with their teeth and would not be placated until he was stoned to death but he was speaking truth as as your father's duns have done so do you also why shouldn't you what has ever happened to alter that continuity that unbroken connection have you ever rejected the sins of your fathers then you end them and as they did you do also you do always grieve the Holy Spirit of God one man saw him die so gloriously without a murmur whose last words the Lord laid not to sin to their charge that he couldn't spit it out the most supreme religious view finally had to buckle under kicking against the Gods when the Lord broke upon him in that great shining light on the road to Damascus and said so so why do you persecute me who art thou Lord praise God for a little Yiddish sechel that when God speaks he knows it who art thou Lord and I knew it 31 years ago Jewish atheist and ex-Marxist stumbling into a messianic bookstore in Jerusalem didn't know there was such a thing to hear God call and say art you're not to leave great rebel who had never submitted to any authority on earth my record in the US Army was a scandal I organized a strike we ain't the company commander out of his car and threw him into the shower he said I want never again to have another company of men from New Jersey and Brooklyn but when God with whom I have to do called me by name and said you shall remain I didn't even ask why how who what I don't need to he doesn't he's not required to explain he's only required to call and I've been trying to obey that call since and believe that I'm obeying it now and obedience is blessing well let me end on the on the positive notes we began with covenant breaking I want to end with covenant keeping the same God who has given us a historical opportunity to recognize our pathetic dismal failure gives us one last occasion in which we shall not fail because as my brother read beautifully and led by the same spirit at the inception of this service God is giving us a new heart taking the stony heart out from our flesh and giving us a heart of flesh and my spirit I will put within you and I'll write my covenant in your inward parts and no more shall any man teach another you shall all know God from the least of you to the greatest I'll write my law in your inward parts and you shall fulfill my statutes because I will pour out my spirit upon you and then you I'll make an everlasting covenant with you it'll never again be broken it'll go on millennially and eternally because I will be all in all that's the consummation and the end of the age to which we're coming and in that life and by that spirit we shall bless all the families of the earth we shall proclaim the mercies of the Lord and his great patience toward us who has preserved us and kept us and sought us and in the end to a remnant of us saved us out of the last afflictions and restored us to Zion to be his people for his name and to be sent from there to bless the nations to him be all praise and glory and honor forever for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever this is the scenario of the last days the restoration of Israel by the unmitigated grace and mercy of God totally deserved when Moses said show me thy glory God hid him in the cleft of the rock and he showed him his hesed the Hebrew word for a loving kindness and mercy his mercy is his glory
