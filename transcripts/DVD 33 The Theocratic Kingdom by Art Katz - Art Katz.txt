DVD 33 The Theocratic Kingdom by Art Katz - Art Katz

We see the beauty of their lives, and their character, and their integrity, and we hear them speak their many languages, and see their intensity, and their passion, and their character, and their nature, and our hearts covet them for the kingdom of God, that they might be an end time people of God, proclaiming a salvation throughout the earth. The issue of history, which is the issue of the nations, is the issue of the church.

Precious prayer, introduction, and platform.

I'm especially happy for the reference to the word prophetic, because that gives me opportunity to make excuses. That if you're looking for a coherent and systematic statement, don't look this way. A prophetic statement is of necessity messy, and unordered by man, and even now, a tremulous thing of an uncertain kind. I have no knowledge of how this is going to come forth. Just appreciating the opportunity to stammer, and stagger, and splutter before you brave ones who have come. On such a topic, such a theme, that has remained to this day for the purposes of God, and maybe the derelict condition of the church and of men, relatively unknown. And it's a mystery that needs to be revealed. And that it is given to apostolic and prophetic men to be stewards of the mysteries of God. And so to the measure that this is my calling, and to the measure that the Lord has given me some illumination, and to the measure that I'm going to enjoy a grace now of unction in order to make known the mystery that has been concealed, you'll hear it. And I'll announce it as the mystery of Israel and the church. The mystery of Israel's restoration. Knowing that you've heard, likely, some statements about the subject, and yet feeling that I have a perspective that is to a degree unheard. And that you're hearing it not because I'm Jewish, because I've been Jewish for 61 years, and I've been a Jewish believer for 25 or 26 years, but that did not in any way entitle me to have a handle on the things that I'm about to share. You're hearing them because it has pleased God to give me a measure of revelation pertaining to them. Not so much because I'm Jewish as because I'm a servant to the church. And it's the perspective of the mystery of Israel as it pertains to the church that is my particular burden. And who and what that Israel is and how it's to be fulfilled, I pray the grace to unfold commencing from now.

I want to pray.

And having looked forward to this occasion, and asking your patience as it comes forth in spits and spurts and jerks, that by the time that the last occasion is over, there will be some kind of a statement that makes sense. But for now, I believe that the Lord wants me to begin with an aspect that is rather new for me, tenuous, that is I'm not quite clear, and yet extraordinarily important. Namely, that the issue of Israel's restoration as a nation, we're not talking about the peripheral Jew like myself, who is by the grace of God brought into the body of Christ. I'm talking, however precious that is, about the destiny of this people as a nation. And not implying that the nation today, the political nation Israel, is yet that people. But that there is a nation of that people that will be restored, that has everything to do with the Lord's own coming. That in fact, the Lord's coming is so inextricably bound to the restoration of this people, that you cannot dismember or disassociate the one point from the other. You will not see me until you shall say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And I think I can say with a certain degree of confidence that if they will not see him, nor shall we. That his coming for them is his coming for us. And more than that, his coming is a coming as king. And that the issue of his coming is the issue of his kingdom. Despite other references to the kingdom now that is becoming increasingly circulated in the church, it is my view that that is a presumption, I don't know to what degree I'm going to address that, and a conceit of the kind for which Paul had already warned us, lest we would be ignorant of the mystery of Israel and become wise in our own conceit. And our own conceit is to think that we as the church either are the kingdom, or will of ourselves bring in the kingdom, or have replaced the Israel of God, and are that Israel, are all, in my opinion, expressions of the conceit about which Paul warned, if we continue to be ignorant of the mystery that pertains to them. So the issue of Israel's restoration is the issue of the king and his coming, and the establishment of his kingdom. That's my theme, my opening theme. And if you understand that, and if I'm correct in that, you can understand why it is that the heathen rage, and that the nations and its rulers imagine a vain thing. You, of all people, ought most to be aware that the Gods of this world have reigned and influenced the conduct of races and of nations since time immemorial, and do not want to give up their vaunted, what's the word, usurping role as the power that lies above the earth in the realm of the air and influences the conduct of nations. And that we have had, in modern times, the revelation of how vivid, real these influences are, that though they are invisible, and at least in every city and nation constitute an invisible realm of influence, at least one time in our modern history have actually taken over the whole apparatus of state itself, namely Germany in the Nazi time. That there's no way to explain, sociologically and politically, the phenomenon of Nazism independent of the dark, demonic, satanic powers that had not only opportunity to exert their sway and influence, but actually to possess the whole apparatus of state, and give us, in modern times, a demonstration of what is their ugly nature and character, coming within a hair of threatening the entire civilization of the world and expunging or exterminating systematically the people in the Swindigoth. People and land and place go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem to all the nations of the earth, then the way to avert the threat to the loss of influence and sway is by exterminating the people through whose return his kingdom comes.

Capiche? Good.

That's a tremendous thesis, and if I could have the grace so much as to establish that out of the scriptures, we would have more insight into the nature of anti-Semitism and the virulent hatred of the Jew and of Israel, which is even while we are here, daily escalating and I believe will flood the entire earth, that there'll be a demonic anti-Semitic fury poured out over the earth, which God himself will employ, as I hope to show sometime in the course of these days, as an instrument in the sifting and the finding for himself among that people, that Israel that will be the nation through whose restoration his kingdom comes. Did I say that this was not going to be coherent?

I take it back.

That was as coherent a statement as I think I've heard from my own lips. And so Lord, I thank you for that grace already. I'm panting and sighing, not because only this is complex and rich, but that it's the fulcrum, my God, I pivot. That remarkable central issue, that foundational stone, that I believe is critical to the Church's whole apostolic and prophetic view of the faith, not only that it is called to understand the mystery lest it be wise in its conceit, but is called to be the very agent and instrument by which the mystery is itself fulfilled. Lord, give us grace to speak, to make known, to hear, to understand and to receive this word, which we believe is on time, given now for this Church and this nation. We thank you and give you the praise, my God, for our privilege.

In Jesus' holy name, amen.

Well, let me take you on an uncharacteristic for me tour of the Scriptures. This is not my thing, saints, and I have no particular relish in being a man who leads people through a survey, but I feel that it's necessary to give some sketch of these things in the Word with this statement that as many Scriptures as I'll have the grace to share with you this afternoon, they are only a faint indication of the enormous welter of Scripture on the subject.

It is an extraordinary phenomenon to note.

The remarkable plethora, T-L-E-T-H-O-R-A, abundance, the prolific weight of Scripture on the subject of the restoration of Israel that is to be found throughout the entire Holy Writ and particularly in the prophets of Israel having to do with this restoration and sound it again in the New Testament Scriptures, and yet despite that to have such a remarkable ignorance on the part of the Church toward it. I can't understand that, and yet I know it to be true, and it was true indeed in people or place, is to think that rather these are suggestive words that mean something of a metaphorical kind pertaining to the Church, and in that way and with that habit which has characterized the Church throughout all the ages since the apostolic time, we have lost the mystery. More than that, we have lost the key to hermeneutical treatment of the Scripture, the key to interpretation of Scripture itself, because the issue of Israel is so much the issue of the Church more than you can possibly now imagine. If already I'm beginning to suggest that even the way in which we read the Scriptures are affected by our consideration of whether indeed it means a literal people, a literal place, a literal Jerusalem, a literal Zion, a literal restoration, or these are only words that are to conjure up a spiritual implications for us who believe, because those things are written for us upon whom the ends of the age have come.

Understand what I'm saying?

This is a critical issue of Scripture interpretation itself. It's a critical issue of how we deal with the Word of God, which is to say the issue of God Himself for the Church. For if the Church itself will take liberty with the Word of God, what is the significance or the consequence of that for the Church in its own constitution, its own integrity, and its own presence in the world? So I believe more than we know, the Church has suffered significantly by a tendency to dismiss the literal meaning of the words of God that pertain to that nation, to that people, and therefore all of our scriptural reckonings have suffered to that degree. You say why would we avoid the first evident meaning of Scripture in their contextual and grammatical sense? Because there's something in our carnal, gentile hearts that is reluctant to acknowledge that God has a place for this people of such an ultimate and significant kind. There's something in our insecurity as God's people that cannot find the magnanimity, the graciousness, the largeness of heart to believe that God will have mercy upon whom He will have mercy, all the more when they so evidently and patently don't deserve it. It's a real test for us whether we will love what God loves and hate what He hates and line ourselves up with Him despite the character and conduct of that people that though we were at one time fascinated by them and interested about them and made dancing little trips to Israel to plant trees and to attend Feast of Tabernacles conferences, are growing less attractive, more difficult to support, and finally, unless we are really rooted in God, we will find ourselves with the world hating them because we are on such a distinct and prophetic course. The prophetic scriptures say all nations shall come against Jerusalem to destroy it. And we are on our way to seeing that fulfillment. Even its greatest ally, the United States, is now beginning to sound another kind of note about its attitude toward its up till now choice ally in that the conduct of this people increasingly forces the United States to be put in a strange position at the very time that they are wanting the alliance of Arab powers in this crisis that has unfolded for it in the Middle East with an intransigent Iraq.

Am I getting fancy? Let me say that again.

Because of the strange amalgamation of powers that the United States has been required to establish to be a counterweight to a threatening Iraq, which includes Syria, Egypt, and other of the Arab nations with whom we never thought we would be in any kind of alliance, let alone military partners, that our attitude toward Israel now is even more painfully examined by those nations and that we find ourselves more and more disposed to line up with them and against Israel in the issues that are arising like, for example, the recent disturbance in Jerusalem where a number were killed around the temple area over that stone throwing thing. And Israel was universally condemned for the violence that was employed in order to quell that disturbance. We need to read the papers and see the news with a scriptural eye, with a biblical awareness that there's an unfolding taking place moving us toward the consummation of what the prophets have all along spoken. All the nations of the world will come against Jerusalem to destroy it. And in that day, the Lord himself will defend that people, but not before there's a tremendous decimation and a suffering.

It raises an interesting question.

If I don't have another occasion in the course of these days to speak it, I'll say it now. Where will the Church of the Nations be in the day that the nations themselves officially turn against Israel and likewise come to a place of anti-Semitic hatred toward the Jews within that nation? Where will the Church be in that nation in that day? Where was the Church in that nation? In Hitler's day in Germany. It collapsed like the proverbial deck of cards. It could not stand the enormous pressures that had come against it. For to stand with that besieged and oppressed minority in that land and at that time would have meant to join them in their fate, in their suffering, and in their extermination. So in that sense, the issue of Israel might well become, at the end of the age, the issue of the Church. In fact, I'm bold enough even now to say that the issue of Israel at the end of the ages, which is not that distant, may well determine who is the Church and reveal it. The apostate who continue to call themselves Christian will identify and align themselves with the policy of their nations, but a remnant people who had long before made their peace with the necessity for suffering and even of martyrdom will stand with that people knowing that the issue of that people is the issue of the Lord's coming and the issue of the establishing of His Kingdom. There's a remarkable verse in Deuteronomy 32, and if anybody has any particular light on it, please see me at your convenience. I only sound it now to bring it into your consciousness and into your prayer. It's that little kind of a nugget that God occasionally gives.

Deuteronomy 32, verse 7 and 8, really verse 8 and 9, but 7 leads into it.

Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask thy father, he will show thee, thy elders, and they will tell thee. When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children or the sons of Israel. For the Lord's portion is His people, Jacob is the lot of His inheritance.

Don't ask me what that means.

I can only share what I intuit that it means. Something like this, that in the mystery of God, the very issue of the nations, their number, their geographical disposition, their purpose in the ultimate economy of God is altogether pegged and related to the issue of Israel itself. Now wouldn't that be enough to make the Gentile nations chafe? There's a mystery here, Saints, about nationhood itself, about government itself, about the economy of God and the purposes of God in His creation, having established nations that somehow is central to one nation, the nation which He has created and chosen and established for Himself. It says in Zechariah, the God who hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke you.

Why He would do this?

It's because, as I'm going to say again and again through these days, because He is who He is and will be who He will be, that's why. Because He will have mercy upon whom He will have mercy. Because He has chosen Jerusalem. Because He has set His King on His holy hill Zion, that's why. Because it pleases Him to take a people that were not a people, a scummy nothing, a band of desert rats and sheepherders, the lowliest of all occupations and make of them a people for His name and through whom His government would come, that all the families of the earth would be blessed through them. And I'll tell you what, that our relationship to God, our identification with His purposes, the whole mystery of God, the issue of His Kingdom, who He Himself is, will be profoundly and adversely fallen to the degree that we do not understand, do not relate and do not align ourselves with the things which He has chosen. There's a certain scandal of which I'm becoming aware, and I really appreciate your patience for this funny way that I speak, fancy words and all that.

It's the scandal of specificity.

It's the scandal of particularity, which makes something in the soulish, carnal nature of the Church, let alone the world, to chafe that God is so explicit, that He is a God who chooses a particular people, a particular location, a particular geography, a particular nation, a particular city, and a particular hill on that city upon which He will set His King. And I have to confess, I'm one who has been offended.

I like the larger view.

I like the metaphorical sense of these things and their spiritual application of what they really mean. But I don't like to be hemmed in with the narrowness and the confinement of a God who says what He means and means what He says and what He means when He says Zion and the Holy Hill and Mount Zion.

He means that pimple in Jerusalem, literally.

Why is it we're offended by the literalness of God? And I'll tell you that if Israel served no other purpose than to confront us with something in the depths of our own carnal hearts that doesn't want to give God the leave to be literal, then let it serve that purpose. Because lest we find ourselves with Israel of old, of being guilty of the sin of, what's the word, of restricting the Holy One of Israel?

That's not the word. Somebody help me. It's not restricting.

Limiting the Holy One of Israel. Hey, if He wants to be particular, if He wants to be literal, if He has in fact chosen a particular people, however much their present conduct and character does not even indicate that choice, the fact of the matter is that it seems to say that they have blasphemed His name in every nation where He has driven them. They seem to be patently disqualified for the fulfillment of His choosing and have run from their mandate and their call. They've given the world its Karl Marx's and Sigmund Freud's and Steven Spielberg's and every other one who's mucking about in Hollywood now and in the rock scene and culture to proliferate the world with their own messianic alternatives that have their origins in hell. I can say that as a Jew and know that it's true and still know at the same time that they do not qualify because they qualify.

In fact, they strangely qualify because they are disqualified.

That He might have the eternal praise of the glory.

I mean, look at me. Why am I here?

And sharing these things when only a quarter of a century ago you wouldn't have dared pick me up off the side of the road. Belligerent, angry, vicious, anti-Christian. Looking upon the goyim, the Gentiles, with such disdain and looking upon Christendom, Christianity itself as the single greatest obstruction to the progress of mankind. And like Paul of old would have breathed out murderings and threatenings against the Church if I had the ability. And yet I'm standing before you as the minister of God not because I was qualified but because it pleased Him to have mercy upon whom He will have mercy. What is there in our Pharisaical hearts that resents that? I think it may be that because we think in our own secret hearts that He chose us because we do have some qualification. That though we subscribe to the doctrine of grace in our secret hearts we believe that there was something in us that caught the attention of God which He so urgently needed for the perfection of His Kingdom. And therefore we chafe a little bit when God will have mercy upon whom He will have mercy. And the best we can do is begrudgingly say, well if you have to like the older prodigal brother but we don't rejoice and run with the Father to put a robe around the erring Son's return and to slay the fatted calf and to rejoice with Him. Oh dear children, the issue of Israel more than you know it is really the issue of the Church. Its heart, its condition, its love for God, its identification with His heart despite everything naturally, socially, nationally and culturally speaking that is calculated to bring you on exactly the opposite ground. What, is there not one among you who was in the same classroom with a Jewish student who got straight A's while you struggled merely to get by? Don't you know any Jew who has come out of the Holocaust with a tattooed number on his arm and in the space of a decade or two has a beautiful home in a garage with two or three cars and is living much more comfortably than you that have been working so hard all these years to make ends meet? Isn't there every reason, naturally speaking to be irritated, to be resentful to be chafed by a people of this kind and even their superiority and their swagger? I'll tell you what they are calculated to reveal our secret heart and where in fact we are and just how converted we have been. The ultimate test of whether we are indeed the people of God is our ability not only to love the unlovely but to love the enemy for they are the enemy of the Gospel for our sake.

Hallelujah. Psalm 2.

Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands of thunder and cast away their courts from us. But he that sitteth in the heaven shall laugh the Lord shall have them in derision then he shall speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his all displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord hath said unto me that what my son this day have I forgotten you and have asked of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel be wise now therefore oh ye kings be instructed you judges of the earth serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the son lest they be angry and you perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him. How many of us have read that and read that and have not understood what it is that vexes the kings of this earth and the rulers the principalities and powers the rulers of this world's darkness why it is that they have been so viciously opposed to this nondescript little nation and have attempted historically again and again to expunge and to exterminate them entirely because they know better than the church that God has reserved that nation, that people that place, that city that hill for his king and that he who is to be king over Israel is not king over Israel only but all of the nations and if we don't understand the issue of Israel in the context of the nations and the issue of rule and of government we don't understand the issue of Israel. You notice that I'm not appealing to you on the basis of sentiment and I'm not appealing to you on the basis of guilt.

You ought to love the Jew.

Look what they did for us and they gave us the Bible, they gave us Saul and Paul and all.

That's true but that's not the appeal.

I'm appealing to you on a much larger apostolic and prophetic ground namely the glory of God that shall cover the earth. The knowledge of God that shall cover the earth as the waters cover the seas when his rule shall go forth over his creation that is so scented because of his own wisdom in the restoration of this people to whom he said, you shall not see me except you shall say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. I think we've missed the mystery of Israel to the degree that we have missed the mystery of God. We don't understand him who chooses what he will choose. He likes that little pimple of a hill Zion and indeed I believe with all my heart saints in all the particularity and specificity he will have a literal king on that hill called David who will rule over Israel forever and through them to the nations and the nations and the powers that influence them today know this mystery better than you and therefore they want to expunge remove put their fingers in their ears, blot this thing drive that people into the sea and get them out of the way so that there's no possibility whatever of the fulfillment of God's intent for his king on that hill. If we don't see that, if we don't understand that we don't understand.

Bless the Lord. Hallelujah.

Psalm 83 Keep not thou silence O God, hold not thy peace and be not still O God, for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up their head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones. Could that be the remnant that is yet to be revealed? Because Paul says not all Israel is Israel. But from among them not all will jury because he will purge out the rebels. He will shake them like a sieve over and through the nations that not so much as one kernel shall fall to the ground. And I believe that New Zealand will be among the nations in which that sieve will be shaken. And the redeemed of the Lord will return to Zion.

To that Zion. Literally.

And sighing and mourning will flee away. So what do you do in singing that as a chorus for yourself?

That's not for you.

When did you ever sigh and mourn?

And why should you have?

It's only a people who are going to be so utterly broken. So utterly disappointed. So utterly and unspeakably rejected. Their every and final hope destroyed. Cast again into the nations and through the nations dispersed and exiled, hunted and pursued and hated. That God will find from among them purging out the rebels, those whom he will return to Zion, having been there before but not as the redeemed of the Lord and mourning and sighing will flee away. And they'll come with singing and rejoicing. The very fact that we have sung that as a chorus for ourselves painfully indicates how erroneous an understanding we have. How presumptuous we have been as the Church and that we have fulfilled what Paul had spoken. That because we were ignorant of this mystery, we became wise in our own conceit and took all the references for Israel to ourselves. When if we had but a spiritual odyssey, there's no way that it could have spoken of us. But a people who have suffered his judgments, suffered his wrath, that's not the statement of the Church. And will also experience his mercy because he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy and also their restoration out of desolation. And this I believe with all my heart is the great and final drama at the end of the age in which God will do this before the face of all nations and not in a hidden corner. And it is his final demonstration of who he is in himself. For who he is in his mercy is who he is. And the nations that will not recognize God in his merciful dealing with the remnant of this people and the return which he will effect when he will restore them to the land which he promised their fathers in the fulfillment of his word and his covenant and his promises which is the issue of God and his character and his faithfulness.

Shouldn't we be jealous over that?

It will be a demonstration that to refuse that is to invite the judgment of God. And if I'm correct in believing that this is already working in time and historically and is to be the final and greatest dramatic revelation of God through that people and for the Church, what is the statement of ourselves in our own prophetic understanding and character and constituency who are so sublimely ignorant of it?

The veil needs to come first off our eyes before it comes off theirs.

Repentance needs first to come to us for our conceit before it comes to them that he might comprehend us all in his mercy. Oh the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God, who has been his counselor?

Who suggested this to him?

For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever. Dear saints if any of you think that I am promoting the subject of Israel because I'm a Jew you've got another think coming. I'm promoting the Israel the issue of Israel for the Church because it's the issue of his glory forever. More so than any single factor at the end of the age. And though it's the issue of his glory eternally and forever the issue itself is determined in time. Namely in the last days and before I let you go by Monday morning you will understand deeply that it will not take place independent of us as the Church but necessarily through us. And a Church of such an ultimate kind who could not fulfill the mandate on the basis of its present charismatic constituency which is okay for us and satisfies us and blesses us but cannot possibly fulfill the obligation of God given us toward them who are the enemies of the Gospel for our sake. We are on a collision course we're locked in with God in a reciprocal relationship with this people that not only determines their destiny as a nation through whom his rule will go but our destiny as a people who will rule and reign with him from the heavenly places in concordance with their earthly kingdom role. I'm speaking this by faith as I look out on the people of God I have to stagger, hold tight my knuckles go white on the pulpit to believe this but that's what it says in the Word and I do believe it and despite what we presently are and how we appear, I know that we will be transformed, transfigured, we must be. And the heck of it is this, we will not be if we continue to be ignorant of this mystery and don't rise in awareness and determination to fulfill it for it is our making as well as theirs in the ultimate prophetic and apostolic sense.

What a statement.

You'll have to take it by faith for now and as these sessions go on the Lord I think will persuade you. Psalm 83 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones and have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance for they have consulted together with one consent, they are confederate against thee.

Isn't that an interesting statement?

That to be against Israel to take thought against that nation is to put yourself in opposition to God. Well that's one thing for the nations who are ruled by the municipalities and powers but it would be a far more shameful thing if that were the statement of the Church. You take note of these verses and ponder them why it is that the heathen rage why it is that the enemies of God have such a vicious opposition to this people being a nation and that want the name of Israel to be no more in remembrance. It's not because they don't like Jews it's because they don't like the king of Israel the greater David and the fulfillment of the promises made to the father David to be king on that hill because it's the end of their influence and their sway in jerking manipulating and destroying the nations. Would to God, you know what I would ask for today? Not so much as simply for Israel but the vexed soul of a Job who cannot abide one day more the muck, the filth and the degeneration and the corruption that is swallowing the earth. The systematic abortions, the bloodshed the incest, the rape the looting pillage, the filthy subculture that is being paraded and celebrated as good. The degeneration of language and values, everything that's taking place in this world that is dark and satanic and being sold and merchandise and purported as good. That our souls would chafe and say how long Lord, how long? Come Lord Jesus for your coming means a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. If we but had this in our deepest heart it would be remarkable how the issue of Israel would so come clear. But alack and alas the world is too much with us. We don't chafe and rush to the target and other stores to buy our children their mutant ninja turtles like everyone else.

And think them harmless.

... ... ... ... ... For it shall come to pass in the last days is that where we are? Are these the last days? Are we living as if we really believe that? It shall come to pass praise God for the truth of that and the finality of that. It shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountain.

So I'm reading from Isaiah chapter 2.
