Overview of the Last Days - Art Katz

But it will go through you and beyond you to the Church of all Latin America.

So we have been praying in a remarkably ambitious way for the Lord.

That He would lay foundations for the Church that cannot be moved. And the end result is a highway of holiness. Which my Jewish people shall tread throughout the whole of Latin America.

In the last days on their way to Zion. We'll speak more of this later. But the reality needs to be established tonight and tomorrow night.

Through the word which the Lord will send.

In the beginning was the word.

So Lord we're asking in your precious jealousy over your own purpose and will.

Which we understand only in part. That you will redeem this night. And all of the occasions before us in these days. To lay your own foundation.

To not only bless the Church but make the Church a blessing. That the Church itself will be the highway of holiness. In which your people shall pass over.

So speak Lord. For these great purposes. Filling my mouth with good things. Opening the ears and hearts of your people. And the remarkable phenomenon of your word. Even as it constitutes an event. More than instruction. But establishes something. Even by the speaking.

In Jesus name we pray.

Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you.

Some of you may have been offended last night after the service who came up for personal prayer.

Instead of answering your request as I could easily have done. I asked you a question.

Have you brought this request to the elders of your own Church?

Before coming up to us. And most were surprised by the question. No, they had not done so. Or they come from congregations where the elders leave something to be desired. I said you go to them nevertheless. Because there is something at issue here more important than your personal need.

It's the issue of the government of God. Which is the issue of the kingdom of God. Which is the issue of the word of God.

If any among you be sick.

Let him call for the elders of the Church. Let them anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith.

So they might be healed. We don't want to circumvent that requirement in God's word. Because it weakens and demoralizes the Church. And robs the elders of their responsibility. And the exercise of their authority. That's why they are weak. Because you haven't called upon them. And reminded them of their responsibility. To be in that place of God. That can confer blessing. In the local body in the assembly.

We must honor the principles of God.

And be turned away from personality. The visiting speaker. As if he has some special kind of magic. And that assures the immaturity of the Church. So we want to turn the attention away from ourselves. And direct your attention to where it belongs.

To the elders of your own Church.

And to find your healing there. To find your healing there. And not in some magical hope that has to do with a visiting speaker. Nor his personality. So don't feel insulted if we direct you in that way. It will be a blessing for you, a blessing for the elders. That the Church might be the Church.

And divine order be restored to the Church.

In the respect for its authority and government.

And the preeminence of the word of God.

If any among you be sick, let him call.

For the elders of the Church.

That's humiliating. You know them too well. You see them in their humanity. They don't have that mysterious charismatic quality that the visiting speaker has. But if you knew us as well as you knew your elders. There's no special magic about us.

So let us grow up rightly unto the Lord.

Amen. Amen. I think that by and large we're much more sick than we should be. We are more sick than we ought to be. We have too many ailments. And I think that the problem is our preoccupation with ourselves. We are too much the center of our own concern.

Which roots us in the earth.

We're looking down. How we feel, how we appear, our condition. When God calls us to look up. We are heavenly minded people. So we need to break the power of self interest. Self centeredness. Even as Christians. Because all that is earthly is carnal. Selfish. And even devilish. Gives the enemy opportunity. When we are preoccupied with ourselves. And the things of the earth. God has given the church a remarkable provision in this regard. That provision is Israel itself.

So when the church in Rome asks Paul, Is God finished with the Jew?

What does he answer? God forbid you should think that. They have only momentarily stumbled. Even in the crucifixion of their own messiah.

So that salvation might come to the gentiles.

So as to move them to jealousy.

That's in the book of Romans chapter 11. I think it's verse 11.

What a remarkable statement.

Salvation has come to the gentiles through the momentary fall of the Jew.

But there's a purpose in God. For which reason salvation? But there's a purpose in God. For which reason salvation has come.

Which was such an astonishment that required Peter to receive a vision in a trance. For salvation is of the Jews.

And Peter was asleep on the roof of the house in Jaffa.

And the Lord brought him into a trance.

And he saw a vision of a scrawler, a parchment coming down. Full of pictures of unclean animals.

That Jews were forbidden to eat according to the law.

And the voice said to Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter. Kill and eat.

And even in his trance he cries out as the orthodox Jew. Lord you know I have never eaten anything unclean. And the Lord said what I have made clean, call thou not unclean.

In that moment there's a knock at the door. A group sent by a Roman authority.

That Peter would come and speak to them about the holy faith. Having received the trance that is no longer unclean, Peter went. Because otherwise he would not have entered the house of the uncircumcised. And as he was sharing in this house of the Roman with his family and staff.

About what had happened in Pentecost.

While he was speaking the spirit fell on those who were listening to him.

And they began to speak with other tongues.

Exactly of the kind that Peter and the disciples experienced. Peter said how shall we deny them baptism in water seeing they have received the same gift.

It was an astonishment. God was saving Gentiles.

And the salvation which is of the Jews.

And giving them the same spirit. And that never happened before. This was unprecedented.

That such grace and mercy should come to the Gentiles.

And they came back with the report to Jerusalem. God has done something new. He's establishing a church. Both of Jew and Gentile. As one new man. We need to appreciate the gracious gift that has come to us. It was far off and without God and without hope in the world.

You have received the salvation intended for the Jews.

And have shared with them in their faith. In their covenant, their hopes, their promises.

So later on Paul is explaining to such a church. Who are asking is God finished now with the Jew?

Are we now the new Israel? God forbid you should think that. They are only temporarily set aside. The natural branches have been broken off that you might be granted.

So through their false salvation has come to the Gentiles. And Paul adds that one further statement.

So as to move them to jealousy. Let that sink deep into your hearing. Let that sink deep into your hearing. For you are not exempt from that responsibility two thousand years later. You cannot plead that, well, I'm not capable. I'm just an ordinary believer. I have no distinction. I can't begin to impress these Jews. There's no excuse for the church anywhere. Because this is not only a provision for the Jew. It's a provision for the church itself. There's a purpose for your salvation beyond yourself. And a purpose of such magnitude. That it has the power to break self-interest. Ego-centrism.

The deep thing that keeps the whole of mankind in bondage.

Self-centeredness. I, me and mine. My health, my economy. Me, me, me. So, in the world before we were saved. That self-centeredness was expressed in wanting a different car, better place to live, food. But when we come into the church, we bring it with us. We bring it with us. We still have this orbit, this centeredness. But it may not be expressed so carnally. But we are still the center of our own universe and our own world. So we are a congregation of individualities.

More than the organic body of Christ, which is the genius of the church. More than the organic body of Christ, which is the genius of the church.

What can break and cancel this so great power? We are first and foremost in our own consideration. The purpose of God. To move the Jew to jealousy. And Paul doesn't tell us how. But it's got to come through you. It's the reason for your salvation. Beyond the benefit which salvation has brought.

You need to recognize the mystery of God.

In the church and the Jew.

Which is as binding tonight as the day in which Paul first spoken. A church that is ignorant of that mandate, of that requirement.

Will retain its selfish character. It will become a thing unto itself. It will live for its own enjoyment. It will be outside the purposes of God. It will fall short of the glory of God. It will have no place in his eternal purpose. And glory.

I'm glad that the Lord restrained Paul not to tell us how to move them to jealousy.

But I want you to sense the magnitude of this responsibility. That cannot be demonstrated as individuals.

But only in the totality of the church as the church.

You've got to exhibit something together. Another kind of reality. As seen in your relationship. In speaking the truth in love. In the way in which you respect each other. You're not stopped by differences. Of race, of nationality, of sex. It's a nationality. It's another society. Of a heavenly kind. That is rooted in love. And righteousness. And truth. That speaks and does and acts rightly. And is not selfish. Is sacrificial.

Exhibits the character and nature of God.

It's a piece of a kingdom already come. That has never seen. And could not themselves know. Because it's the work of the spirit. By those who have the spirit. The church. Amen. Thank you Lord. I'm walking ever so carefully. I don't want to overload you.

But I want you to turn to Ephesians chapter 3.

And show you another piece.

Of the apostle Paul's wisdom and understanding. By which the church becomes the church.

As more than a place for a succession of services. And benefits that we would receive. Although of course there are benefits. They are not the first purpose for our being as a church.

God has established the church of the gentiles. To perform a particular function for his people Israel.

To move them to jealousy. And also to extend mercy. And they might obtain mercy. Because the hour is coming. And is now at hand. When Jews the world over will need mercy. Or they will all together perish.

In Ephesians chapter 3. Paul reminds the church of his commission and call. That we might understand the knowledge which is his in the mystery of Christ in verse 4. Of the things which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men.

As it is now revealed.

As with holy apostles and prophets.

By the spirit.

That the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body. As partakers of the promise in Christ in the God.

Paul is summing up what I have already said. Of this remarkable mystery. Being revealed now. That the gentiles who were far off. Without hope, without God in the world.

Have now been brought near by the blood of the Messiah Jesus. That they should be fellow heirs with the Jews.

In the same body. Partakers of his promise. In their Messiah. Through the gospel. What a remarkable revelation. That we have taken all together for granted. Have not understood. Have not appreciated. And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling. And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling. And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling. We think we invented the church. No, it is a continuation.

Of the faith already understood and held by believing Jews. Of the faith already understood and held by believing Jews.

And you are being joined together with them into the same body. And you are being joined together with them into the same body.

To have part in their promises and their inheritance in the gospel. To have part in their promises and their inheritance in the gospel.

Of which he has made a minister. Before that you were wild branches. That could not bear fruit. By its very nature. But God has grafted you into their tree. But God has grafted you into their tree. That you might receive the sap and the life through the root. And the fruit buried. A special fruit. That cannot be had and formed. Except through the life flowing through the sap. And it is that fruit that will move them to jealousy. And it is that fruit that will move them to jealousy. Because they themselves cannot bear it. Because they are broken off out of their own tree. Because they are broken off out of their own tree. Paul says don't you boast. Let you be broken off. For if you don't hesitate to break them off. For unbelief. For if you don't hesitate to break you off. Therefore do not boast. You do not support the root. Because the root supports you. So be fruit bearing. By the life that is now available to you. When you are consciously When you are consciously Grafted into their root. And understand it. And are grateful for it. And receive the benefit of it. Otherwise You remain a dead fruitless branch Even though you are grafted in. The sap flows by your gratitude. By your awareness. That you are grateful To be grafted into their tree. And you are not too proud So as to despise it. You count it as privilege. To be grafted into Israel's tree.

Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Of the patriarchs and the prophets. Of the holy prophets and apostles.

The whole history of that people. Then Paul continues.

So I made a minister according to the Grift of the grace of God. Unto me who am less than the least of all saints. Verse 8 Is this grace given? That I should preach among the Gentiles The unstruggable riches of Christ. And to make all men see What is the fellowship of the mystery Which from the beginning of the world Has been hidden in God Who created all things by Jesus Christ To the intent that now Stop.

We are not going to read this quickly. We need to prepare ourselves.

The chief apostle The chief apostle Who is the least of all saints in his own estimation Because the more authentically Spiritual you become The more you recognize your least. Therefore to him can be given The revelation of the mystery Hidden from the beginning of all time That now is to be revealed That God who has created all things Through Jesus Christ In order that And here is where we should stop breathing In order what Paul? What's the purpose for God creating all things What's the purpose for God creating all things What's the purpose of this creation This world The races and nations of men The resources God has placed in the earth That's only an enablement But it's not the purpose It makes the purpose possible The great apostle Is about to tell us Is about to tell us What is God's purpose In having created all things In having created all things Through Jesus Christ In order that Are you ready? In order that Through the church Through the church Under the principalities and powers in heavenly places Under the principalities and powers in heavenly places My verse 10 My verse 10 Might be known the manifold wisdom of God Amen In order that through the church Let this sink in dear saints God has created all things In order that Through the church If we were not told anything more This we know That in God's sight The church was so important to him That he did not think it extravagant That he did not think it extravagant To create the whole world and the universe In order for the church In order for the church That something might be performed Through the church And only and exclusively Through the church We need to wake from our sleep Church is more than a succession of services Even good services It's a mystery That goes back to creation That God foresaw the church And his purpose through it That required the creation of all things May you rise to the importance Of what it means To be a member in the church Of Jesus Christ in the world For which reason God has created all things Because we're suffering From a sense of inferiority We're poor And we don't have large things In which to boast We don't have a makeshift church It's not a glass cathedral We don't have many material advantages And we're living beneath The estimation That we ought to have Of the church Which if we understood it Would enable us to rise To the stature and the fullness Of Jesus Christ Until a perfect man Oh, if you could but see Oh, if you could but see it Oh, if you could believe it What a calling And what is it For which we have been created The church and the world To demonstrate The manifold wisdom of God To the principalities and powers In heavenly places Now that is stupefying What kind of wisdom And to whom is this demonstration made It's not even for the world It's something in the air The principalities and powers of the air That this is important to God This is very important to God He wants to demonstrate something to them That will bring a final defeat To their influence in the world And can only come through the church I'm always wanting to pray Again for more grace I'm holding my breath As if the whole history and future Of this congregation This work Of the church of Latin America Is hanging in the balance Right now In the understanding and the receiving Of this mystery Of which Paul is made a steward That he might teach the church The inestimable riches in Christ And the reason for its own existence Beyond its own enjoyment Beyond its own self-centered interests Beyond the issue of its health Its poverty Its possessions Its reputations Its enjoyment There's a purpose in God To make a demonstration That would never occur to us To be important But the fact that he has created All things for this What to persuade us That it's important for him And he did not think it extravagant To create all things the world That it could support the church So that it might make this demonstration Of the manifold wisdom of God To the principalities and powers of the air That cannot even be seen That are invisible Over every nation Including Mexico Every city and locale Including Monterrey And have been exerting throughout all time Their influence Their power To suppress mankind To excite anger and violence And bloodshed and death Because they have another wisdom That is based on selfishness Not ambition And they want to rule They want to influence They want to jerk and manipulate Nations and peoples And they've been having a field day till now As history shows it History shows it In Africa Black against black Wholesale genocide by the million Men, women and children In bloodthirsty anger Because they're not on the same tribe Because the pride of one people Has been excited against that of another Oh, you dear saints If you will not And cannot Understand That there's an invisible Realm of reality that Roots over nations And exerts Its sinister Nefarious influence To jerk And manipulate men To cause violence, riot, disorder Chaos, death Then you are naive And you're lost to the purposes of God Then you don't know where the action is And everything that you do Is beating against the air Is futility Not recognized Not understood Not come to a maturity of understanding To recognize this conflict And our place in it Is bringing it to an end Through the church You say, brother, if that's true Where in recent history Has there been a demonstration Of this influence? That can actually Though it's invisible And in the air over cities and nations As any man knows who travels Between nations As I have I'm merely crossing the border You're breathing another air There's something in the air That's different than other than The country from which you've just come That shows the influence of the Principalities and powers in that place And keeping with the history of that place And you can feel The opposition It's real What's the greatest demonstration In recent times of this truth? Nazi Germany The most Civilized Highly accomplished nation Civilization That has given to the world Beethoven Mozart Do you know these names?

These great composers? Am I just freaking over the head? Do you know what philosophy means?

Great philosophers Great theologians Great poets Great ethics Great culture, great civilization But in the space of ten years Some gutter snipe In the bottom of beer cellars Led by occultic influences Celebrating the swastika The broken cross Formed a political reality Of which the Jews said This shall pass This nation with its history will not tolerate that Such a piece of scum as that Will never rise to any kind of place of influence And within two or three years He was the chancellor of Germany And Nazism had taken possession Of a great nation And set in motion The development of its military power That it could sweep through its neighbor nations Poland Czechoslovakia Austria No one could stop them They conquered the whole of Europe And were stopped only by Russia In the Russian winter Or else they would have conquered the world In the process of which They systematically annihilated Six million Jews Called the Holocaust Oh dear saints Don't you know about this That you have a responsibility Of the church To have some understanding of history And what is happening in the world And what might yet happen And understand what the root of the evil is That not only can influence nations But possess them And perform its evil Especially against the Jew Which they hate Why? Because they know better than you If the Jew is ever restored To the God of their fathers If the redeemed of the Lord ever return to Zion The king will come Who said to them, you'll not see me again Until you shall say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord The Jew shall say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Will you understand me when I say The return of Israel Is the coming of the king Not the present political state Which is yet to experience judgment Uprooting and expulsion At the final restoration Spoken by the prophets since the world began The king will come And take his place Upon the holy hill of Zion As the son of David Qualified to sit upon the throne of David And rule not only over Israel But over all nations And that will mark the end Of the false rule And influence Of the principalities and powers of the air Amen We have prayed that the Lord would enlarge Your capacity to receive These things The church is called To a great last days drama The conclusion of all the ages The coming of the king Who was born to rule Out of Bethlehem shall he come forth unto you Whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting Whose to be ruler in all Israel That the law might go forth out of Zion And the word of God out of Jerusalem The church is called To a great last days drama The conclusion of all the ages The coming of the king Who was born to rule Out of Bethlehem shall he come forth unto you Whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting Whose to be ruler in all Israel That the law might go forth out of Zion And the word of God out of Jerusalem To all nations That they would study war no more Amen These powers crucified Christ Paul says in 1 Corinthians If they had known They would not have crucified the lord of glory He said, but brother I thought the Romans crucified him They were the instrument But the wisdom and the will Based on these powers Expressing their fury and their anger And their indignation Against God and the son of God Thinking to remove him from death Who received their vicious death In humility With a complaint And did not answer back in kind He did not answer back He went as a lamb to the slaughter He went as a lamb to the slaughter Silently He didn't complain that I'm innocent of what I'm being charged You need to stop what you're doing I don't deserve this fate How dare you I'm the son of God Not a single complaint Not a single complaint Nothing in his own defense He had to fulfill the prophetic word He went silently as a lamb to the slaughter And when the people were provoked By the powers to antagonize him Come down from the cross and we will believe you Come down from the cross and we will believe you In everything that should have brought him to a boil of resentment That they're mocking him even in his suffering like to death If ever he had a reason to be indignant And you'll let them have it You unbelieving Jews I suffer for you And even in my agony I have to be listening to your mockery Then let this curse be upon you He answered not a word Because in his death And in his suffering He was revealing the wisdom of God The character of God The willingness to suffer Without complaining Even if it was unfair Trusting the Father To vindicate him eternally And saying of his tormentors Let not this sin be to their charge Forgive them For they know not what they do He was full of mercy And more consideration for his tormentors And more consideration for his tormentors Than for himself So Paul tells us in Colossians That in his suffering and death at the cross He inflicted a defeat Upon the principalities and powers He publicly revealed them And disarmed them But he did not extinguish them He left that for you They suffered a basic defeat They are stripped and disarmed But they still continue to function Through intimidation and threat And lust To move mankind Away from God To the Gods of this world Therefore Paul says In chapter 6 of Ephesians We wrestle not against flesh and blood But against the principalities and powers of the air The world rulers of this state Those who rule this world And this age of darkness That's the reason for the drug trade And for corruption in governments And authorities that can be bribed and paid off And elections won or lost by bribery The world is corrupt And its governments And its vicious Its trade, its prostitution Its drugs, its pride We don't wrestle against flesh and blood But against the root of evil The principalities and powers of the air The rulers of this world's darkness Which is why Jesus said The prince of this world comes But he has nothing against me Wake up, dear saint We're called into a war And we're included We begin it, we finish it We wrestle This is not some light activity Because the weapons of our warfare Are not carnal But spiritual To the bringing down of strongholds Through prayer Through intercession Through fasting Through true worship Through obedience and sacrifice That's the wisdom of God Demonstrated by the church That is the church That is the wing who can wrestle And fight There is a purpose for our being That we need to recognize And receive As ultimate responsibility That we would say with the Apostle Paul Who is sufficient for these things Lord, you have called us to that which is Beyond ourselves Well-meaning intention cannot fulfill this requirement Even to be charismatic or Pentecostal We have got to be charismatic Even to be charismatic or Pentecostal We have got to come into the reality Of the life of God Himself Into the Overcomer Into His resurrection power Into His authority As the Son of God Who was resurrected and ascended And enthroned exalted on high We have to reach that level We have an apostolic responsibility That can only be fulfilled on the apostolic ground Which is the resurrection life Of the ascended Christ Not just the acknowledgement of the truth Of the doctrine of resurrection Not just the knowledge of the doctrine But the actual appropriation That we might say with Paul For me to live is Christ That is the reason why You can ask my brother Tony And we have been together in many places in the world He says the greatest things That ever issue from you Is when you are exhausted Weak, uninspired Because it gives God the greater opportunity To be all in all To be all in all Can God succeed In making of the Latin American Church In all of its Spanish Latin and Romantic culture An apostolic reality Then when they are sick They need to call for the elders of the church They need to subscribe to the word of God They need to humble themselves And ask prayer from men whom they know And weaknesses they have seen And yet believe That those same men Can by a prayer of faith bring healing And they are not to be overlooked In preference to the visiting speaker Who appears to be so anointed That you would bypass the government of God And be encouraged in your immaturity To run after personalities And seek to be healed When your sickness has more to do With that kind of immaturity and spiritual condition Than you know If we are going to defeat the powers of the air It's by a people who have come of age Who obey the word of God Who respect the authority of God in the church And make the authority respect itself And make the authority respect itself Only a church of this kind Displaying a reality of this kind Can move Jews to jealousy Nothing less, nothing other But a church that has come of age To a people who have no distinction in themselves To whom God has taken off the dung heap Who are beggars of the dung heap Or would die also at one And he makes to sit with the princes of his people And makes them the nobility of God The aristocracy of the kingdom Men and women who have come of age Of maturity Of responsibility Who are living lives appropriate to the kingdom And the glory to which they are called Who will not make excuses for themselves Oh brother, I didn't have your advantage I never had education I come from a poor family I never had a real father We have all things in him With whom we have to do The wisdom of God is this That he has chosen The weak and the foolish thing To confound the world In what it thinks is wise and powerful That out of the mouths of babes and sucklings He has perfected wisdom So as to stop the mouth of his adversary Amen The Lord has made the poor To be rich in faith In James chapter 2 In the book of James chapter 2 The apostle James tells us Harken my beloved brethren What does that mean, harken?

What does that mean, harken?

Don't just listen casually Hear this This is your deepest consideration Has not God chosen the poor Of this world rich in faith And heirs of the kingdom Which he has promised to them that love him But you have despised the poor It's not only the rich who have despised the poor But the poor who have despised the poor Who despise themselves And think little of themselves And are not living in the dignity Which is their gift in the salvation of God That God has appointed that the poor Should be rich in faith And are not to be despised Because they are poor Because they are weak Because they are foolish in the world's sight Because through such a people And only such a people Will the glory of God be obtained When he defeats the principalities and powers of the air And he will celebrate power, strength Learning, prestige, wealth, force Violence He will defeat them By the demonstration of his own wisdom In the beauty of holiness In the simplicity of the saints Whom he has taken off the dung heap And made to sit with the princes of his people And has given to them his spirit And the gifts of the spirit Is the gift of wisdom and knowledge and understanding And discernment And every provision for Godliness in life That they might together constitute a church Of an organic kind Really joined As the body of Christ Every joint supplying A body that can wrestle And discern and recognize The evil over their own country Over their own locality And defeat it Not by carnal means But by spiritual means Through intercessions Through prayers, through fasting Rightly enforcing the powers of darkness That have kept the entire locality And city and nation Embodied Demonstrating that there's a God Who has set men free By the freedom which you yourself enjoy And exhibit without license You're not living in fear Intimidation That what about the future What about money What about money Because you're people who believe God in their work Who said seek first the kingdom of God And his righteousness And all things will be added unto you So this precious rabbi with whom we met yesterday and today Born in Buenos Aires Lived his entire life in Latin America Who are you he said What are you about Why are you here in Monterrey Well I said for the same reason that I was in Singapore Related to Indonesia Holland, Germany and Israel Holland, Germany and Israel Holland, Germany and Israel Holland, Germany and Israel For the same reason that I was in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore Holland, Germany and Israel And going to Africa And all over the world I'm serving the God of my fathers And I'm the author of several books Traveling widely Serving the lord He said What is your organization Your movement How you're paying for this Who pays the bill I said seek first the kingdom of God And his righteousness And all things will be added unto you We are not limited by the Mexican economy We are not affected by What are the natural resources of our nation God is not limited By the earth which he himself has made He has seen to it That certain areas would be impoverished That if there is a people in the midst of those areas That are enjoying prosperity It's not to be attributed to the accident of resources Or the skill of their manpower But to their faith in God Who will give all things To those who seek first The kingdom of heaven And his righteousness So let me conclude for tonight And ask you a question It is the question What is first for you Your own self interest Your health How you're feeling Your son, your children, your family These are legitimate natural concerns But they're not your first concerns When you make them your first concern You're substituting an idol against God Seek first the kingdom And the king And his purpose Which is other than your own And according to what we have read in the Bible Which is other than your own And according to what we have read in Ephesians Has no benefit for the world at all A demonstration Through the church Of the wisdom of God Against the principalities and powers of the earth As Paul says Is the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus So God has sent me All the way to you Where others have rejected And are unwilling to receive it To put this question to you The church that is the church That will fulfill the Eternal purposes of God And have a distinguished inheritance And eternal reward Because they will suffer If they put the interest of God first The powers of the air will take notice And they will begin to fear And oppose you Who up till now have not bothered you Because they say Jesus we know and Paul we know But the church in Monterrey Buenos Aires So long as the church Lives for itself In its own self interest In its own benefits In its own enjoyment The powers of the air Yorn in our faces We constitute for them No threat But a people who will determine The first purpose for our being Is the fulfillment of the purpose of God The eternal purpose Which is established in Jesus Christ Is creating all things So that through the church The manifold wisdom of God Might be demonstrated To the princes and powers of the air Whatever that cost Whatever that means However much it's against our own self interest However much it opens us up to a new opposition A new kind of persecution We will be willing And not only willing We count it privilege And rejoice with the honor Of the call Whatever the cost When the powers see a people like that Who are not just resigned to their fate Well I guess we have to God called us but I'm not enjoying this When they see a rejoicing For the privilege of God And high calling of God and Christ Jesus By a people who are willing to bear The opposition that has always come To those who make God first They will tremble They will break They will lift up And they will be able to break Those powers Those that have been dominating They will be able to release the captives So that your message of the gospel Will find open ears And open minds and hearings Because you have fought the spiritual battle And have looted the captives By your own spiritual warfare In wrestling Against the powers of your own locality And free the captives By the demonstration of the freedom That you enjoy And by which you are freely choosing To put God and his purposes first That if there's not a Jew for miles around You still take it to heart That we have a mandate to move them to hell They may not be here now But they will be here soon And at that day May they see through us The foolish The uneducated The poor The glory of their God The uneducated The poor The glory of their God Radiating out of gentile faces Who know him and love him So you need to be prayed for What a call What a mandate Who can even understand this in one hearing Let alone obey it And obey it as the church The whole body together Organically joined Submitting to the government of God Mature Mature Separated from the world Free from ambition Lust Cannot be intimidated Cannot be threatened Not looking for their advantage in the world Knowing that God himself Is the rewarder of those who diligently seek him Thank you It's a privilege to stand before you And speak these things The survival of my Jewish kinsmen The survival Will rest with you And also their salvation When you move them to jealousy By the heavenly quality of your life Together That is expressed in total unselfconsciousness And unselfish love In humor In righteousness In mercy In the willingness to sacrifice Even your own health and safety For those who are not like you Who never did anything for you Who are Jews The brethren of the lord Whom you love as he loves By his love The unconditional love of God That cannot be offended That they have never seen And never expected to see Through gentiles That's how I got saved That's how they will get saved The issue of Israel's salvation And Israel's restoration And the king's coming And his kingdom Depends on you Now join me in prayer That the lord will seal Your consecration That you're saying in your heart And you're saying aloud to him What this man is speaking tonight lord I don't understand it all But I understand it sufficiently It will require everything from me Perhaps my physical life This may be the route The path to martyrdom But martyrdom is a privilege And it aims a crown So I want you to know lord I'm not content to be An ordinary saint in the pew I don't want my Christianity To be a succession of services I don't want it to come up To every visiting speaker and say Can you pray for me I need this I need that I want to be overcoming Mature Walking rightly To the kingdom and the glory I want to rise To the fullness of your intention Together with those with whom you've joined me Submit it to the authority God has given And growing up together in him Able to wrestle, able to serve Able to move Jews to jealousy Able to defeat the powers of the air Over our own locality That has been enslaved until now Because they didn't even know There's a freedom available From us, from ambition, from fear From insecurity You may see it in us A people who are unafraid Not be intimidated Because we know God Because we trust his word Because he's made available All things So Lord Seal something tonight This is more than message Lord This is transaction This is kingdom come This is great reality This is the purpose for our being For our salvation Beyond ourselves Seal it Lord Because if you cannot succeed With this people With this pastor With this congregation We're than anywhere in the world Can you succeed? Bless them Seal them Help them To be what they must and ought To say yes to you tonight And declare to the principalities And the powers That we are at war with you We are at war with you We will not succumb to your influence To your seduction To your intimidation We have been freed By him who has conquered The power of death through death And made of you an open spoil And removed your weapons And we will finish what he has begun By the same demonstration Of the character of God Revealed especially In suffering unjustly In whatever measure of the cross We have to bear At the conclusion of the age That is the wisdom of God That is the wisdom of God So we thank you Lord For the high calling of God In Christ Jesus Which we received tonight With sober understanding As we have never before understood And say yes And count it privilege For the high call And the grace to fulfill it That life that broke the fetters of death And rose and ascended on high By that life By that power We shall overcome We shall triumph You shall be glorified Israel shall be saved Her king shall come And peace shall be ruled In the earth In Jesus name We pray Amen
