Apostolic Proclamation 2 of 2 - Art Katz

So I wrote a paper at the seminary, I think it was called, The Genius of Apostolic Transmission. What is the anatomy?

What is the, in particular, quality of apostolic proclamation that distinguishes it from all other speaking? What does it mean that a prophet is an inspired preacher?

The word has suffered great loss. Preacher, almost like the bottom of the pile, like if you can't do anything else, you know, you can preach.

But the first statement of the anointed ministry of Jesus, where he recites Isaiah 61 in the synagogue and says, this day these scriptures have been fulfilled in your hearing, reads in Luke 4, 18, the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach. Just stop right there, he hath anointed me to preach. The first statement of the messianic call. So there's a conjunction between anointing and preaching. Any preaching that is not anointed is not preaching, it's oratory. So this is a remarkable phenomenon, and it's a life and death phenomenon, because how shall they hear of him, how shall they call upon him of whom they've not heard, and how shall they hear except one preach, and how shall one preach except he be sent, is the heart of the whole mission calling of the church and particularly to the Jew. And somewhere in the course of this paper, I take that up in a little bit more detail, that what they're waiting to hear unbeknownst to them is preaching of a particular and ultimate kind, namely apostolic preaching. The preaching of one who is sent, because God gives not the spirit unto measure to him. He whom he sends, to him the spirit is given without measure.

So this sending is critical, and we talked about it somewhat, a sending community. have to be sent from someplace, and the nexus is a community of a particular kind. So I just want to pray now, and I'm just wondering, I've had another flicker of thought, if maybe I should just go through this entire 12 or 13 page paper without interruption, and you can write down little notes to yourself of questions that you want to raise, but we should go through this uninterruptedly and then come back over it, okay? We'll get the whole flow, because some of the questions you might raise will be touched on the very next page.

So Lord, we count this as a particular and special occasion, for if we are called to anything, it is to be the bearers of your word. And we know, my God, that there has been much loss in this regard, and that your own prophets have said that there'll be a famine for the word of the Lord in the last days.

Men will run to and fro. That there'll be a profusion of speaking, as there is even now, welters of tapes and videos and communications of all kinds, and yet in the midst of it, a famine for the hearing of the word of the Lord.

So precious God, we ask that you would give us a deep, fresh, new perception of this holy sacrament, your word.

What distinguishes it? What is the anatomy of it?

What is required in the bringing of it forth? What is prophetic proclamation, seeing that men are out to establish their reputations and their acceptance on some basis other than the word proclaimed?

And use, my God, this rudimentary thing that you allowed me to write at the seminary to open a vista for us and to suck the marrow from the bone.

Lord, we want to be changed in our character and our life and in our ministry, that the word of the Lord in our mouth would be truth. Bless us now, open our understanding, my God, make us keen students to dig out, Lord, all that you would have us to understand and to hold in thanking, give you the praise for the privilege. In Jesus' name, amen.

As it happens, sometimes you can write one paper and have it to serve for two different classes. So the one paper that I wrote in one class, it was called The Preached Word as Divine Event, semicolon or colon, Preaching as Humiliation.

That was the title in one class, and the other was The Genius of Apostolic Transmission.

And it was the same paper for both classes, and I got credit for both.

I quote 1 Corinthians 1, 18, 21, the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through wisdom, they pleased God through the folly of what we preach. To probe for and articulate a certain theory of apostolic transmission or oral communication that may not have been adequately recognized till now, the reasons might lie perhaps in the failure to be sufficiently literal in our attention to Paul. It is my contention that the word of the cross is the power of God. That is, it contains an inherent divinely penetrating ability to register divine truths despite the severest religious, cultural, and ethnic resistances, as well as to create faith so as to believe unto salvation.

That is a mouthful.

So it's the word of God as event, and not event under auspicious circumstances, but inauspicious.

That is to say, an event despite resistance.

Say heavenly word proclaimed in the earth, not to those who are willing hearers, but resistant hearers, for the earth resists heaven, and every power of darkness wants to cloud the minds of men, keep them from understanding, keep them from response, and we've talked about this when we talked about Israel, the whole history of the enmity of the Jew and Gentile, of the historic relationship of the church and the synagogue, the prejudice, the forced conversions, the exile, the threats, Jews required on Easter to hear messages on the passion of Christ and prodded to be kept awake, and rabbis forced into disputations publicly with Christian scholars to show them the error of the Judaistic rejection of Christ, and this has been the history of Jews in Europe. Everything is calculated against understanding, so it requires a word of an ultimate kind.

So I just want to read again what I've just gone over.

This word of the cross is the power of God. There's something inherent in the word that is a power. It contains an inherently divine penetrating ability to register divine truths despite the severest religious, cultural, and ethnic resistances, as well as to create faith so as to believe unto salvation. It performs a work in them that believe, or a work that has brought them to the place of believing, and that is some work. That is a paraphrase of a statement in 1 Thessalonians where Paul says something like, you know that When you heard the word of God, you received it for what it is. Not the word of man, but the word of God which produces a work in them that believe.

What kind of a work was it?

Sufficient to turn men from serving idols to serving the living God, and to wait for his son who comes from heaven to save them from the wrath to come.

What a work that is.

It's good to God that that work has been performed, or is being performed in the modern world today.

You say, well how come? Because they're not hearing what the Thessalonians heard.

They're not hearing an apostolically preached word.

They're hearing a word of a lesser and another kind.

The content of those words may very much be the same, but there's a particular power and a penetration sufficient to loose men from the idols that they're not hearing, and that's the genius.

That is, we've lost it and it needs to be found again.

Paul had it, and his word was a work in those that heard it. The phrase word of God then is not so much a generic terminology, but literally a word of God.

You know, we have to pause to say that, but this is how we turn a holy thing into a clich√©.

We say the word of God, the word of God, the word of God, the word of God, becomes dribble, that almost anything that is spoken becomes the word of God. It's the word of God, or it's not the word of God. It's a divine communication of a uniquely powerful kind, expressed through a human vessel under conditions which I hope to suggest in the course of this paper. Paul's own acute awareness of the phenomenon is expressed in the first epistle to the Thessalonians, the scriptures that we're just talking about, and for this reason we also constantly thank God that when you receive from us the word of God's message, you accepted it not as the word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God which also performs its work in you who believe that.

I added the word that.

Something is required from the hearer to believe that what they're hearing is the word of God. But think of the presumption of Paul to say, for what it really is, there's no question in his mind. And if there's a question in any mind of a man who speaks it, it no longer is the word of God. If the speaker himself equivocates, if he himself has not the faith to believe that the word out of his mouth is the word of God, then it's not.

It then becomes his word.

It's biblical, but it's not the word of God as event.

Paul believed that, and that has characterized my own naivety.

I have believed that, and I have reason to believe it, because it's so often, if not invariably born out of weakness, that if there's any word at all proceeding out of my mouth, it has to be God.

From what other source could it have come? And when is my witness? How I came off the airport there at San Antonio, what do you call that, ramp, absolutely depleted coming from that conference in North Carolina with the Black Believers and kind of Rick Joyner and every other kind of thing, an hour or two away from the first meeting of five or six days of meetings and saying, when, never having met the man before, brother, I just have to tell you, I am absolutely bereft of anything. I'm a zero. I have no inspiration. I have no thought. I have no knowledge. I have no understanding. I have no strength. I'm at a loss. And then embarked six days of tapes and messages so precious that I sent all 11 of them to Rick Joyner for transcription and hopeful publication.

It was the word of God to those who believe.

That doesn't mean that you hope, hope, hope that it's that.

But as we go on, we'll see what is required that it should be that a measure of the efficacy of that word can be intimated from the depth of conversion from paganism indicated in the statement, how you turn from God, from idols to serve the living and true God, a conversion of such authenticity as to invoke persecution, seeing that they, quote, also endured the same suffering at the hands of your own countrymen, unquote, indicates that to be that rightly could pull boast for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit with full conviction, which I believe we need to read not as a generous rhetoric, but a literal and accurate description of a particular mode of transmission rare in our own time. In the distinctive nature of this communication, if the distinctive nature of this communication is its power, what is its character? What can be observed from the text in First Corinthians that would give hint to the keys to be found in apostolic preaching? Paul is careful to instruct his Greek correspondence, contrary to their own culture and love of rhetoric, that the preaching of the gospel can actually be voided of its power if it is expressed in the eloquent wisdom of men. This is an especially significant thing Paul writing to Greeks, because the Greeks prided themselves in eloquence, prided themselves in rhetoric, and Paul is saying that the word of God is something altogether and qualitatively different from that, and if in fact you lapse into a human eloquence, you avoid the statement of its power. Equating the gospel with, quote, the word of the cross, unquote, which though followed to men, is itself the power of God, and in chapter 2 we read in First Corinthians, when I came to you, brethren, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God in lofty words and excellency of speech or of wisdom. My speech and my message were not implausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and power.

At a time when I had spoken the Ezekiel 37 message at a church in Nashville where they went down in a remarkable prostration before God, I was driven home after that meeting by one of the young leaders of that congregation who has since left it by things that were set in motion because of that visit, and he said something like, that was an apostolic event. I said, well, strange you should say that, I mean, it may have been a prophetic statement. I said, what makes you think it's apostolic? He said the power.

I said, but there were no signs and wonders, there were no apostolic indications of miracle that would attest to that. He said the bringing of men down into death and the being raised up again into a new quality of life is that power.

So I'd never before seen it or understood it that way.

We always look for other signs and attestations, but the word that can perform that is ultimate power.

And I don't have time to elaborate, but I don't think it was accidental that I was wakened from a nap, already asleep in the pastor's office while the service was on, on the final message after some controversy as usual being generated in those days, and had to stand before these people rubbing my eyes, you know, and that they could visibly see that what they were hearing could not come out of a man who was all primed and ready to go, but had just been wakened. And right out of that sleepiness and low keyed kind of dullness, whoosh, came an eruption of the life of God.

And from that point on, it was the word of God. So what I would like to advance is that the word of the cross is not necessarily the statement or description of the actual crucifixion of Jesus. The word of the cross doesn't mean that it's the word describing the cross. There's another meaning implicit in that, even when the cross itself is not necessarily the subject matter, it can still be the word of the cross. Even in the same way when Paul talks about preaching Christ and Him crucified, or we talk about preaching Jesus, you can preach Jesus without making Jesus the ostensible subject of the preaching, and it's still Him.

And I hope to develop that as we go on.

The substance of the anatomy of that event replicated in the humiliation of the preaching itself. What makes it the preaching of the cross? That the substance of that event replicates the humiliation of the cross. The preaching itself is a reenactment of the cross experience. Every time the cross is reenacted, in any humiliation that comes from an obedience, the power that was demonstrated at the cross in the first is again given opportunity to be expressed, proportionate to the degree of what is actually born or suffered in that humiliation.

True preaching is humiliation. True witness is humiliation.

True prayer is humiliation, which is another word for suffering and death. So wherever that is issues from the moment in truth, the power of God will always attend it. And the reason we don't see the power of God in preaching is that men take the pains to avoid such humiliation by being assured that they're going to get through the moment through preparation, notes, outlines, other dependencies that will see that they get by. They are unwilling to take the risks of failure by standing there with their face sticking out, trusting the operation of God in the moment for the word.

Now I don't want to say that everything is required to be that total spontaneity. That's not to say there's not room for preparation.

But in the event itself, room must be made for God. And if we insulate God by our own religious, human, professional preparation, we avoid the operation of the cross, the foolishness of the cross, the suffering of the cross, the humiliation of the cross, the power of the cross. So by this I mean that classically in the Gospel encounter the stakes are so great, the issues of eternity being at hand, that it is beyond the sphere of unaided human ability, however sincere and well-meaning. That being so, no matter a man's natural qualification and strengths, he must in that tremulous moment be, quote, in weakness and in much fear and trembling.

I don't know how many times in the course of these weeks someone has said to me who is going to be speaking or sharing, I'm trembling. And I would say, so what else is new? If Paul trembled, what, you not to tremble? But it doesn't mean that you're deterred from obedience. You still speak, but you speak with trembling. Paul did, and we do also. Not because of the fear of embarrassment or failure, but a trembling that is aware that every speaking is the issue of life or death. Would you think I would be romantic if I said that includes this man?

That something is being brought, issues are being touched, consequences can flow from this, and what is assembled around this table and what will go on that tape, there would be a point of difference of life or death for someone at some future time because it would affect the kind of quality of the word that they might have heard. Especially if we're talking also about the ministry to the Jews of the last days waiting for an apostolic word, that by the very hearing of which faith might be created, it's a creative word. And what shall we say about the whole conclusion of Ezekiel 37 message?

That they're waiting for a word to bring them out of their graves.

That spoken at command, something like Jesus at the grave of Lazarus, come forth. There the word of God had better be truth in his mouth, while Lazarus remains pent up in his grave. It's not just the two words, it's the two words spoken out of a particular mouth, out of a particular life, with a particular authority that becomes the event itself of the very kind that God created in speaking over the inert elements and the chaos when he brooded over the deep.

That's where the trembling comes in. It's not a trembling in fear for oneself, it's a trembling of knowing how important are the stakes. That's what I was crying out to the wind when I got off that airplane. It wasn't like, boy, my reputation's at stake. It was seeing the importance of these days and what has been arranged and what is being expected. Look at my condition. When I know that life and death is hanging in the balance in very eternity itself.

A preacher who thus intentionally voids himself in trust for a word of God to be given experiences a suffering in measure akin to that of the crucified Christ, in the dying to his own ability to speak, becoming foolish in a humiliation like the Savior's unto death. Here's a statement of what is at the genius, the heart of this apostolic and prophetic proclamation and transmission.

It's a preacher who intentionally voids himself. He sees to it that his own ability will not be his dependency.

And if he does not see to it, he allows God to see to it. That there be an exhaustion, a prostration, or some factors working by which he cannot look to himself. But he voids himself in trust, it's an operation of faith, for a word of God which is to be given.

He's the humble recipient waiting for something to be given. And some of us who have heard messages like that are even conscious of the process taking place. It's like a man crossing a chasm with a pole, putting one foot before the other on a rope and every step has got to come from God. And then the next word is the next step. And then the next statement, the next step, until step by step, statement by statement, the chasm is breached and you have been brought to the other side and the whole people with you. You are on a new side where they could never have come before except by that word.

But it is given in a trembling dependency, virtually, statement by statement, word for word. A lot of the things that I pray, I pray like that. I hear my prayers before I pray them. This order to then is not only hearing the content of the gospel, but the very as it were demonstration and manifestation of the cross and its peculiar power.

The cross is reiterated.

There is another reenactment of the drama of the cross in the very speaking. There's a suffering humiliation and death in the speaking that releases the same quality of power that took place in the first such enactment and will in every such enactment. That's why Paul says, I'm determined not to know anything but Christ and him crucified.

And I suspect that Paul had very commendable natural gifts of eloquence, but he voided himself of that.

He would not make it his dependency because he wanted the faith of men to be established not on the basis of eloquence, but on the basis of the power of God, which is released out of one who voids himself willing to suffer the terrible humiliation when you avoid yourself.

I mean, you know what that feels like when you pull the plug out and you go limp and to do that before, say, 100, 200, 1000, 2000. What difference does it make? The stakes are enormous. It's not your reputation. It's eternity. And you yet pull the plug out and you will not allow yourself to do your dependency.

In a word, the very obedience of suffering unto death by which the veil of the temple was rent, again by the obedience of the preacher, sunders the veil over the understanding and darkened mind of the hearer, not only to emit light on what is otherwise patently foolish and offensive to human sensibility, but to birth the grace of repentance and faith unto believing.

A veil is rent again.

It was rent in the crucifixion of Jesus and it's rent every time again when the same power is released by the same humiliation.

This time it's not the veil over the temple, it's the veil over the heart, the veil over the understanding.

Because have you really considered how patently foolish the gospel is? If you haven't, you will in the day that you proclaim it to a sophisticated and urbane Jew, who is the epitome of another wisdom and another knowledge, and all of a sudden you realize the message that you have to bring to him is so pathetically offensive, so calculated in every point in particular to be at odds with human intellect and reasonableness.

That forsook his deity.

He came down on earth, took upon himself the form of a man, of the seed of Abraham, born as an infant in total dependency in a stable, had 30 years of obscure unknown life, three years of a ministry that was rejected of his people, died outside the city in the dung heap in the junk depot, nakedly on a cross, and that somehow the blood that was emitted in that process of suffering and death is God's provision for sin, and that there's a possible identification with him in baptism by which we are also raised with him out of death unto new Israel. I mean, the whole thing, if you really think about it, God could not have given us a more feeble, pathetically inept word contrary to the whole ethos, wisdom, and mentality of God, and he has calculatedly and purposely done that, that if anyone is going to be saved, it's not because of the winsomeness of the message, it's attractiveness, it's amenity to man's thought, but it's totally contrary, that therefore something has to happen to make that word understandable and acceptable and received, and that operation is God. That's why Jesus said, except the Father draw you, you could not come to me, not by the will of man nor of flesh or blood, but of God.

Of him and through him and to him are all things.

The problem for us is to believe that and to yet give our mouths to the proclamation trusting that this gospel is the power of God unto salvation, and of course you don't know it until it's coming out of your mouth.

You don't have that surge of confidence before you go. It's in the going and in the speaking, as I don't know, at some rate, I don't know what I say or where I say it, but how we had the ten day fast here in the first Ben Israel, twenty-four hours prayer around the clock, remarkable season for us in the history of Ben Israel, and the first, the great message that came in those days was on the Sabbath, and the first thing that God required after those days was an outreach at Bemidji State University. I had been to Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, T√ºbingen, universities in Denmark and Germany and England. I'd been all over, but I'd never been to Bemidji. Well, what is Bemidji? It's a little dinky nothing. We had 6,000 students. I've been in campuses with 30, 40,000 students foaming at the mouth in angry, radical rebellion. So what was this little patsy thing here?

And especially after ten days of fasting and prayer, my God, we were ready to take the world. And we had a final time of prayer in Mon Broga's trailer.

If I could have gotten up and spoken in the heat of what was generated in that moment, the walls would have come down at Bemidji State. No one could have withstood it. Faculty, students, administrators, maintenance men, they all would have gone down. But the only problem was we had to drive to get there. And the 25-mile drive, I could just feel the virtue going out of me, especially when we came up out of the country into Bemidji.

And then you begin to see the visible evidences of the works of man.

And when you come to the campus itself, there was the great TV antenna dish and the brick buildings and the whole panoply of the academic world that speaks of prestige and substance and the values of men. By that time I was so limp you could have picked me up with a blotter. But we had to go through with it. We had made an arrangement.

God had opened the door for us for three days of meetings that were officially permitted.

And we set up our loudspeakers out on the grass and it was started to drizzle and to rain. And the first strategy was to begin in the Student Union Building at noon when everyone breaks for lunch. And so there they were and they were breaking for lunch and they were streaming in and out of that building and there we were positioned in the Student Union Building. And I was to begin at 12 o'clock. And people were walking right by me to go to the coffee machine or to get this like I didn't even exist. You never felt more foolish and more weak and more nothing. And the guys were looking at me, the Ben Israel people, and I was looking at them and there was 1202, 457 and you just couldn't begin. And finally I knew that something had to begin. And so I opened my mouth. Trying to get the attention of people going in every direction and talking, having their conversations and you're going to begin.

And my subject was the soon coming judgment of God. That God has appointed a day.

And talk about something going over like a red balloon. But nevertheless, I saw actual smoke coming out of the ears of angry people and finally one guy got up. He proved to be a faculty member and he cried out, by what authority do you do this? How dare you come right into this campus and the Student Union Building and our lunch hour and proclaim these foolish things. One of our brothers who had a black belt in karate was kind of getting himself ready for taking it. I'm going to have to intervene here. Well, that's how it began. It was an exercise in foolishness. I have never felt it more acutely. And it went on for three days. We didn't see any result at all. The final meeting we spent all day knocking on every door in the dormitories and saying, if you'll come tonight, I promise you, you're going to see something that your religious experience has not prepared you. You've never seen it in your conventional Christian experience.

There's going to be a display of the power of God.

It had to be. We were fasting. And we were exhausted by that going from door to door. Finally, the evening meeting came.

Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the word of the Lord. Having made such a lavish statement, I'm waiting for the word of the Lord and it didn't come.

Finally, the people came, about 50 people in the room. And I had finally had to get up and begin the meeting and introduce it.

And I thought, well, surely when I'll pray the word of the Lord will come.

And so I prayed. And I looked out there.

I wanted to cry out, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

You ever had that feeling?

At the most critical moments, knowing you're in the will of God and that he has appointed this and everything has come to its final conclusion, and you are a complete study of absolute richness and emptiness, and where is God and where is his word?

I prayed and people are looking though. And finally, someone from the Ben-Israel family said, you know what, Ock, can I share this? Well, this morning as I was having my devotional time, the Lord quickened this and she read it and sat down. Then again, the painful silence. And one of the other Ben-Israel people said, Ock, do you mind if I have a word? Oh, okay. Then they came up and that one shared a verse. And then another one came up with a word of testimony. And it's remarkable. I never said anything. That was the message.

They heard the gospel in the fullness of the body.

And the meeting was over. And I just closed it. And I was afraid even to give an invitation. It was so weak and so unimpressive in that little homely series of hearings. And I said something like, well, if anyone has any questions, you know, feel free to come up and talk with any of us.

And then I closed the meeting with Jesus' name.

There's a guy sitting about this distance from me. He'd never taken me. He just had his arms forward, glowering at me. He was the first guy to get up. I thought, here it comes. My Jewish profile ruined. And he said, I have a question. He said, what must I do to be saved? We ended up baptizing four students in the lake that night. I tried to postpone it. I said, can't we do this next week or Sunday? You know, we're not prepared for baptism. And I had my best black preaching pants on. And they said, no, no. I said, okay, you ladies remain behind and pray. We men will go. And we went in the night in the lake right by the university and baptized. I took my pants off. I went into my DVDs and baptized four men. Those four men started a revival and had a remarkable effect, particularly in one of the student fellowships near the campus. And about a year or two later, I came back to Bemidji.

That was the time the Lord closed us down.

And I came for a single meeting. And someone came up to me and said, Art, do you know what happened to those men that you baptized? I said, no. He said, this one is in ministry. This one's gone to betray this one.

And the spirit of God just came like oil.

So it's foolishness.

It's an obedience of suffering unto death by which the veil of the temple was rent at the first.

And it's rent again every time that that foolishness, that obedience and that suffering is experienced.

It tears the veil over the understanding and darkened mind of the hearer, not only to emit light on what is otherwise foolish and offensive to human sensibility, but to birth or to create the graces of repentance and faith unto believing. Perhaps in this light, we can better understand Nigran's statement on his commentary in Romans, a Swedish theologian.

Here's the quotation.

The gospel is not the presentation of an idea, but the operation of a power. The same power, I will submit, which at the first rent the veil, split the rocks and release the dead from their graves, does also so effectively work in those who are privileged to hear the word apostolically given. It is perhaps with this in mind that Paul asks in his Roman letter, how are men to call upon him in whom they've not believed?

And how are they to believe in him of whom they've not heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? How can a man preach unless he be sent?

As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news. To this do the scriptures testify in comparing scripture with scripture. For he whom God has sent speaketh the words of God. Really because it's out of the Bible does not make it the word of God.

I hope that doesn't sound sacrilegious or scandalous.

It's only the word of God when it's the word given. And that word does not necessarily have to be a scriptural word. It could be a word of God.

It could be a word of insult. It could be a word of confrontation. It could be a strange and foolish word.

But if it's the word that it is given, it's the word of God. And that word is attested to by the power of God. A lot of us naively think that if we quote John 3.16 that there's some magic in that. Only if John 3.16 is given is there power in that. It's got to be the words of God. For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. Because any man who will speak the words of God has already come to a sufficient depth to himself that the power of God and the Spirit of God without measure can be meted out to him without any fear that the glory of God will be touched or appropriated, misappropriated. A man who will bear God's words and speak them however offensive they might be to the hearer and even to himself. Such a one as that can be trusted with the Spirit of God without measure. For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. In the absence of the deep conversions affected by the preaching of Paul in our own generation, one wonders if we have sufficiently considered the meaning of the word sent and naively have assumed that any promulgation of the gospel or an evangelization is as blessed and honored of God. Likewise, it is perhaps wise also to consider if any message, however correct, is indeed the word of God, especially if they were humanly contrived to avoid the very humiliation which I am suggesting is at the heart of the gospel as event. The gospel is not a presentation of an idea. It is the demonstration of a power.

It's an event.

If preaching Christ is more than the message about him but the showing forth of him, then the God who sends may yet be waiting for suitable candidates. The issue is the issue of the cross and one might rightly suspect that it will not come to men with full conviction except through the lips of those who know the cross in their own experience and are willing to suffer the humiliation of it again and again in the very foolishness of their preaching. I can multiply the instances of my own brief experience of God.

The one that comes to mind right now is during the ferment over the Vietnam thing and student rebellions breaking out and the Lord had me to sit in a amphitheater at the University of Chicago and I even asked for time to speak on peace and I was given ten minutes. I had been out witnessing and I was exhausted and I don't know if I even, it may even be in this paper, the description of it, and the Lord made that a factual confrontation and that night I spoke at a Big Assemblies of God meeting, a regional kind of meeting, lots of young people and on the platform exhausted and spent in my client's basement pants with one leg a little bit more faded than the other, the Lord said very distinctly, Art, preach on the cross. That's all he said, preach on the cross and I got up, there was no question of what had to be done, I didn't know how to do it, but I preached on the cross and it was devastating. I can always remember that the bodies spilled out over the seats onto the carpets, there wasn't a soul in their seat, a thorough prostration of God like a winnowing, like a scythe had come and whoosh, most of those kids had not even come with Bibles, it was a kind of a youth thing and the whole air was frivolous and you know, good time and the Lord says, preach on the cross.

So the issue is the issue of the cross, by those who are willing to suffer the humiliation of it again and again in the very foolishness of their preaching, preaching is foolishness, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that will believe. If your preaching is not a foolishness, it is not a true proclamation, it may amuse men, it may entertain, it might even inform, it might even inspire, but it will never be an event, never. There's something inherent about proclamation as foolishness when the stakes are so high. We would do well, especially in the seminary environment, that if necessary schools wanted the need for adequate court preparation to consider our call, for God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus whom God made unto us as wisdom. If he is the source both of our life and wisdom, what then of our preaching?

And I'm writing this to a professor in the seminary who's on a faculty that spoke every day for the two years that I was there, in the daily chapel of the service, there was always a place made for preaching, but I cannot remember one message.

And I know with complete certainty there was never any scriptural or doctrinal fault with any word spoken, but it was simply not memorable.

It was never an event, because these men knew months in advance what day it would be that they would be required to speak, and you can believe that they were before their computers and they were processors, processors in their concordances, and they searched that thing out diligently. There wasn't any possibility that there could be anything in which fault could be found either by the student body and especially by their fellow faculty members and administrators.

There was not one who took the risk of foolishness, and therefore we went two years without event. Our own generation like that of the Corinthians to whom Paul wrote, bears a greater affinity for sophistication and self-adulation than the God who made himself with no reputation, nor him whom he sent to count it all things as done. Fennelon in his book Christian Perfection calls us to acknowledge that, quote, we have a horror of every sort of humiliation.

The slightest contempt is unbearable to us.

Indeed, if we have no other occasion to contemplate it, a true preaching requirement lightly considered will enable us to think often of our wretchedness, that we may have only contempt for ourselves and our ability. To preach is not the issue of skill or learner technique, but a divine mystery, and the very word preaching is derived from the Latin prey de carrer, which means to make known. It was at the cross that an uninitiated centurion doled by participation in much murder and violence was compelled to proclaim, truly, this was the son of God. Whenever Christ's humiliation is explicated in the foolishness of preaching, he is again revealed, set forth to be a savior, for just as, quote, God gives grace to the humble, so also does he who is full of grace and truth have opportunity to intersect time and eternity, heaven and earth, in the moment of apostolic meekness when a preacher ceases from himself. A familiar illustration of this cruciform life is to be found in 2 Corinthians, where Paul exclaims, When I came to you, brethren, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God and lofty words of wisdom, for I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. One must assume that indeed for one of Paul's erudition in worldly as well as religious knowledge, that kind of self-imposed limitation required a painful determination. He determined not to know anything except Christ and Him crucified, and that requires a determination because we know so much, and there's so much that we know that wants to find expression. It requires a determination to put away what is so accessible and so available to our preaching. We need constantly to be reminded of the Greek context which celebrated human intellect and sophistication, and that indeed the very word derives from the Greek sophist, that class of professional teachers who instruct it in rhetoric and disputation.

The word sophistication is Greek. Sophistry derives from the sophists who were a class of professional orators who trained men in rhetoric and disputation. This Paul, in weakness and in much fear and trembling, intentionally and consciously avoided.

My speech and my message were not implausible words of wisdom. This foolishness, this voiding of oneself, I am contending is a suffering of a kind analogous to the cross, and admits to that degree it's very power.

Why?

That your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. See how everything rests on the preacher as one sent. That means that the community that sends him is a one kind with him, shares the same mentality, shares the same coercentiveness, or God would not say separate them to me, except the man is already separated, and they can be sent by the laying on of hands by people of like mind and heart and spirit, who have come also to that place, and these are the men who turn the world upside down in power. In his commentary on verse 14 of the 10th chapter of Romans, how shall they believe in him of whom they've not heard?

How shall they hear without a preacher?

Johannes Munch, a Danish theologian, in his book Christ and Israel notes radically, quote, that one cannot hear unless an apostle speaks in place of Christ. He's being sent in place of Christ. In another word, those that are hearing him are hearing exactly what they would have heard had Christ come in himself.

Now I just want to tell you, saints, lest you miss the moment, this is the high moment of the five weeks.

This is the number of the matter. Being sent is much more than just being commissioned. You are sent in place of another, and the other is Christ himself. There's a word that the Jewish people are waiting to hear, and only that word will save them out of death. Only that word can break the power of thousands of years of prejudice and misinformation and rejection of things by which they oppose themselves. Can it be that the notorious failure of the church to proclaim the gospel to the Jew has been the absence of an apostolic preaching? That if the pagans of Thessalonica were won by that word which came to them in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction, how much more the historically resistant Jew?

Should they require less than the Thessalonian pagans?

Playing upon the root meaning of apostolos as one sent in the place of another in the authority of the sender and bearing his words, the Danish theologian continues that it is the preaching apostle alone who enables one to hear because he is the very herald of Christ. Through him they hear Christ's voice and speech, where it's as if we have come full circle. For those who are just visiting now, we began in these weeks somehow by the reading of the Lord himself to take up the question of the voice of his speaking, that there's something in the voice, not just the words, but the voice, the hearing of the voice of the words of the Lord. They hear Christ's voice and speech.

We're putting in a scalpel and laying something there.

We're taking something that has become homiletical skill preaching three sermon points with illustrations and the way in which ministers are trained in their places of training of how to bring the message, how to win the attention of the audience, how to be humorous, how to have anecdotes, how to spice it, how to howl, howl, howl, howl, and this is where we're shoving that off the table and bringing another view to bear about the holiness, the sacrament of the word preached, the phenomenon of the preached word that causes faith.

It becomes an event.

It is more than the transmission of information or knowledge about the gospel. It is the demonstration of its power because it is very God as he himself revealed himself in his own final and ultimate extremity. Crisis reveals, and what was revealed at the crisis of the cross is God, not as we think him to be, but as he in fact is. So that a German theologian has rightly written, true faith begins with the atheist things that should end. Christ on the cross is a scandal, a God hanging naked, unable to cover his private parts with his hands that are nailed and listening to the jeers and the taunts of his people come down and will believe you. I mean it's an unbelievable scene of uttermost degradation and scandal and humiliation and God bore that.

Learn of me for I am meek and lowly of heart.

It's a revelation of God as he is and instead of railing back at those who are taunting him to say father forgive them for they know not what they do. Monk says it is the preaching apostle alone who enables one to hear because he's the very herald of Christ. Through him they hear Christ's voice and speech. Again for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God and God is the word. It's himself that comes through in the word and that is however foolish or even offensive if need be or contrary even to the taste or the choice of the speaker. Yet they are remarkably effective in penetrating for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. So then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Suggest then that the preaching that is salvational is not the relating of information about salvation or how to attain it or the facts of the gospel per se but rather a supernatural event that creates faith in the hearer through the operation of the power of God. The cruciform character that is the life that is related to the cross of that speaking and the speaker foolish weak despised are the adjectives of the crucifixion itself revealing the fresh the crucified one as the Jehovah who saves Yeshua Jesus. The issue of preaching as one's sin touches not only the matter of one's calling or of one's ministry in general but also in particular in terms of each preaching occasion even a prescribed or institutional occasion can be further into a cross event by voiding oneself anew in seeking the sender and yielding despite the risk or loss of the divine interjection and inspiration as it comes. No matter the chagrin of the hearers their disagreeableness their whatever one can be confident that so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and shall prosper in the thing where I thought I said it and that gives me opportunity to say you're not always going to see the scythe cutting through and then falling all over themselves and out onto the carpet and and the aisle ways you'll leave many times and you've not seen anything but what time is lunch and the same obedience that on one occasion has brought men on their faces on the next occasion brings the aeons where Paul says know that your labors are not in vain and that the word of God does not go forth with if it's the word of God you may not see the immediate consequence it's gratifying when you do but we have to be people who are beyond needing to be gratified that it's all the same to us in our priestly demeanor whether we see the prostration of men or their yawns so long as we are assured that it's his word that goes forth because that word will not come back void it shall accomplish that which I please and shall prosper in the thing where into I send it there is the sense that then that the man is as his message and indeed is his message so how can one preach the cross was not already determined for the loss of all which includes his reputation no accident by the way every time a man gets up his reputation is on the line again he could have left you out of your socks last time you have a whole desk full of his tapes but this time all of that can be canceled in one speaking if he falls on his face and I'll tell you what if you adulate that man you can be assured will fall on his face so you know what you know what the temptation is not to risk your batting average and not that not not to speak again I'm afraid to go back to Germany or any place where the Lord has given me favor and grace lest this time it goes flat and nullifies the effect of every previous time every time out again is another cross experience another risk another willingness to be an object of humiliation and disappointment not to some impersonal audience but those who have become dear and to whom you've given your life and poured out your soul I didn't want to go back again to uh to Georgia I said I've given you everything I have which I come back for but they insisted and we came back and came back for five days and they had another brother already there of apostolic stature so what were we going to do and but how the Lord unfolded those days and performed in the last day at event by which the body of Christ itself was formed by a word and I went together in Tiberius and asked to share in a fellowship that was not a fellowship was a kind of a casual flowing in flowing out of Charismatics and other evangelicals who came and went and there was no body and we fasted that day and looked to the Lord all the day long and spoke that night on the word that was given on the body of Christ and that proclamation that night was not a talk about the body of Christ it was the event that birthed it and that body continues to this day in that strategic location in Galilee and how do you know art that is in fact the true body because of the persecution that has been engendered since that time hell broke was orthodox opponents set their meeting place a fire pregnant women were threatened every kind of vile threat of death and and physical harm has come to people that they never experienced before so as long as they were a casual charismatic take it or leave it kind of people the moment that they were established as a body in that locality boom the issue was joined but they continue still very formally and it was birthed by a word and it was a word that was given are we willing talking about reputation and life itself are we willing like Mary you know obedience unto him for that which cannot be explained to men you're willing for the whole can we stay with her let it be unto me according to my word how apt are the words of those who came to entrap Jesus in mark 12 teacher we know that you are true and care for no man for you do not regard the position of men but truly teach the way of God i'm submitting that this must be the description for anyone always who would truly teach the way of God how much more so in our own and perhaps final generation of that time to come when they will not into a sound doctrine but according to their own desires will heap up for themselves teachers and they will turn their ears away from the truth and be turned aside to fables so the characteristic that marks the teacher's length of God is authority one can be correct without being persuasive let alone penetrating but from the outset of the ministry of Jesus it was the authority with which he spoke that attested his hearers and they were astonished at his teaching for his word was with authority and they were amazed and said to one another what is this word for with authority and power he commands let's stop at this point take a break and give this much to the Lord and we're not yet into it there's more so Lord we just thank you for this much precious God our hearts are always delighted when the cross is again raised in the midst of your people and Lord with embarrassment we say it has been too long it's hung up as a place of decoration it has lost its central place and even the form of it has been transformed and the splinters removed and the ugliness and the pain the bloodstained aspect of it altered it's become an architecture a smooth thing and Lord we ask for the restoration of the cross for the restoration of the cross is the restoration of power and that power must again be manifested in these last days for those who are sick Lord put these things in our hearts stab us deep my God with the requirement granted we should see that unconsciously we have sidestepped these this requirement and have sought an easier way we're still a lingering concern for our own reputation how we should perceive how we should be heard how we should be recognized unwilling for the foolishness my God of trust that your power might be released that the world might hear not only your words but your voice grant us my God a sober break and let nothing be lost by dissipation of idle speaking and bring us back with a renewed ability to hear you feel for this end we thank you praise you for the privilege of it in Jesus name preaching and how the thing that distinguished Jesus was that authority what is this word for with authority and power he commands luke 432 and 36 recognizing that all authority rests with God one must assume that the measure expressed is the measure given or better that authority and defined things is God did you think of it that way authority is God in the measure to which he himself is participating in what is being said remember Jesus said my words are not my words but the words which my father has given me and if they're the father's words then the father's authority is in those words is that not the sense of the hebrew meaning of davah which is means not only word but event did you know that the hebrew word for word davah means also event and there's something about the genius of the hebrew language that really gets at the heart of this a german theologian gehrhard abeling says in this connection quote for with God word and deed are one his speaking is the way of his acting we need to think more in terms of word as event which is complete a dichotomy according to the way in which word is understood in the modern lexicon word is a verbalism our christianity is phraseological where as academic students we think that if we have memorized something or can recite it we have it where we're fixated at a verbal level which is intolerable to the hebrew sense and the meaning of word word is event the gospel is God's word because it is God who comes to speak in it this is the theologian still speaking it is the communication of faith so in an hour in which biblical faith is eroding many of us are content with mere scriptural or doctrinal correctness however bland but this abeling goes further and says we are not concerned with just a piece of information about God but with participation in him that is with an event in which God himself is communicated i think this gets at the heart of the meaning of to preach christ it's a christ event God himself is in it his power is his authority his authority is his power and it's more than in the sense of a presence that's felt it's the communication of himself God himself is communicated ditrich bonhoeffer that we have been considering in life together writes the church must here and now be able concretely to speak the word of God the word of power or it will say something else something different something human the word of impetus or authority or authentic speech isn't interesting how he i don't i don't know if he was even conscious of what he was saying here or authority authentic speech one is interchangeable with the other if it's authentic speech it's authoritative if it's authoritative it's authentic speech cannot be enforced by anything except the command of God himself there is no other basis it's interesting that in ezekiel 37 message son of man he commands the son of man to prophesy it's the word of God that is commanded that is to say you're not at liberty to frame it or form it yourself to suit your purpose i think i gave you an instance and i almost was tempted to tell you where it took place but that a very famous charismatic thing where they were offended by my word and i was interrogated by this pastor and his three associates and their accusation against me was not that the word was wrong but that the word was inappropriate you should have recognized the immaturity of our people and some of them are young believers and they can't take a word like that i said but my dear brothers i don't calculate my word on the basis of what i see i don't first sense what is the condition of the congregation and then speak appropriately to that i only seek to find what is the word of God and speak that so we were we were jamming up and not just what was the what the message was but a whole ideological question about the word and how it is to be approached and how it is to be spoken about so the word then is the word commanded if it's the bear God's authority it's the word that he gives and many times you'll not like it you would prefer to speak something else but you have no recourse and tonight you're going to see a tape of exactly that i've never done this before shown a videotape i just happened to have this one and it's very fresh it's a message i've just spoken as with reggie and rick joined his place in left carolina and yesterday i read to you some statements about the prophetic calling i said there was one response to it that was angry that called me unloving judgmental and uh joyless it was rick and so the one subject i wanted to avoid when i visited him was unprophetic lord and he had a meeting arranged i said lord let me speak on anything else what does he have me speak on the prophetic calling and it became a bomb blast i hope i'm not exaggerating i haven't seen the video but you'll see it tonight of a message that was spoken in inauspicious circumstances where a whole relationship with a man who's my publisher is already threatened he's already responded angrily to something that i've circulated to 50 others and now God has me to speak on that subject right before his face in his own place without knowing what the message itself is going to be only to know it's about elijah and to open my text in first kings and to begin and you'll tonight be able to assess for yourself whether it was the word that was commanded the word that was given and whether it was a word of authority how urgent then to elevate the church's whole level of regard for the word as authoritative to elevate expectation for what is faith if it is not that for the word as creative as beyond that which is merely informational and event the word that produces change that establishes the church simply does not have this expectation it is not coming to hear the word of God it's coming to hear a word about God by a man himself who does not believe that he's speaking the word of God you know we think we're being modest but we're really being insulting to God to think that he cannot speak it out of our mouths we're limiting the holy one of Israel and saying yeah it may come out of an art cats or somebody else but you know i'm just the local preacher here how dare you limit God that his word cannot come out of your mouth in fact if his word cannot come out of your mouth there's no hope for Israel for at the end of the of this age it's that son of man company made up of flesh and blood like us who must speak the word that raises that nation from the dead and if you say that you cannot that that's more than insulting it's it's disobedient it's rebellious and it's a word that you'll be commanded how shall we who are preachers and teachers proclaim that who have not experienced the word of God is that in our own lives more than the sermon it is the life that must be prepared another episode that comes to mind where i was stopped at the early part of the message by a woman pastor in california and she went ahead and got in touch with those to whom i was coming as speaker got me canceled and the whole controversy broke and about the controversial message they never really did hear it the lord gave it to me on my knees that morning with our baby in prayer and the issue was that the message should have been submitted before it was spoken i said if you had so little confidence in God's word through me you should never have invited me because i would never come on a condition by which you first have to approve God's word before i could speak it fact of the matter is i didn't have it until this morning and they said well you know you need to prepare i said if the man is not prepared it's a vain thing to expect it in the message it's the life that must be prepared the preacher having thoroughly prepared himself comes before the his congregation this is a quotation from detrit bonhoeffer first and foremost as a man who has been pierced by the word of God and has been led to repentance in the face of divine judgment but also as a man who has received with thankfulness the gospel of forgiveness and is able to rejoice in it only in this progression through judgment and grace can preaching become genuinely original it's another way of saying if you have not experienced it how can you authentically proclaim it which is another way of saying and explaining why there's so little preaching on the cross have you noticed that there is a dearth d-e-a-r-t-h a lamentable lack of preaching on the cross and i think that the reason is this most preachers are not comfortable on that subject they have enough sense to realize that it would be a vain thing to speak on such a subject as that without more of a intimate personal experience of that subject than they want than they themselves possess better to speak about healing or or prosperity whatever it is that's current which they probably have more experience in a word is hardly to be expected that the congregation will expect the word as event if the preacher himself has not that faith and he will not likely have it except that he is that that he has been the recipient of the same ours is an age in which words have suffered enormous abuse and the credibility for them has appropriately been depreciated except that the church and its leaders consciously seek a restoration for the word of power and authority it will suffer eclipse there as in the world we need again to hear the voice of the father as it rang out over the bewildered disciples in the mount of transfiguration hear ye him and when the disciples heard this they fell on their faces and were much afraid and Jesus came to them and touched them and said arise and do not be afraid and i was just looking over there this morning quickly a series of messages given at given at lausanne at white women on the apostolic foundations and the last one was on the apostolic word and i quoted this episode of Jesus on the mount of transfiguration with his three disciples and the father speaking out of the cloud hear ye him and they went down in their faces under the the enormity of that episode and Jesus touched them and said be not afraid and what i said about it is this it was not just a soothing word of comfort it was an event they were not to be afraid because he had spoken that he commanded that his word defeated fear he brought them into a place of being by a word about fear but when we read that we think he's just saying now don't be afraid it's okay so it'll be over in a moment no he's commanding something be not afraid and after that if you are afraid you're in a place of disobedience and rebellion the event has come the lord has spoken how'd you like to hear that speaking in the church and i know that the lord is waiting and wanting for it here what i believe needs to be understood here is that the word of Jesus was not was not yet some well-meaning piece of human encouragement it was the same speaking by which the heavens and the earth were created it was a creative word it was not offered as a reason not to be afraid but the very enablement and creative power not to fear be not afraid let somebody come into your being because of this word we need to expect this kind of apostolic prophetic speaking that is men who bring us words not just to strengthen our understanding but establish our foundations the word has come the event has taken place now it is the outworking of it it has been my privilege at least on one occasion to see an expression of the body of christ actually birthed this is what i mentioned before brought into being word did not exist by the preached word as event before the message a transient conglomerate of unrelated souls afterwards a viable structure of such a kind that it necessarily became the object of the most virulent attack by religious orthodox opponents in galilee should it not be asked if the means by which something is birthed in God is not also the means by which it should be continued in growth if the word established something how is the thing that is established to be continued but by the word of the same correct where to go on from faith to faith hearing to hearing faith to faith glory to glory the word of God is likened in scripture to milk and to meat how shall we receive what we have not believed for and how shall we believe except we hear for faith comes by the hearing of the word it is the concluding verse of ephesians 3 if the concluding verse of ephesians 3 be something more than an apostolic rhetoric unto him the glory of the church by christ Jesus one is pressed to imagine by what means this is to be attained attained independent of the word how is the church to become a glory unto him to him be glory in the church at this age and in the age to come by christ Jesus throughout all ages how by the word that word needs needs to come only in a moment and so many of us who are disappointed and disillusioned and sometimes very defeated and dispirited by the condition of the church needs to know that if a word will come to the church there will be resurrection transformation in a moment things will be established in a moment and by that same power continued and brought full maturity and growth it waits on the word about that kind of word Jesus said it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and are life so i'm frequently telling audiences not to panic if they can't understand what is being said if their mind is not entirely fruitful word of spirit and of life it will be lodged in their spirits and will subsequently be raised to the level of consciousness and understanding see this is new in our own framework if a message is not immediately susceptible to our understanding our minds we get frustrated disappointed and angry that we think that the preacher has an obligation to make himself perfectly understood because we're so attenuated to operating from the cerebral level but a word of spirit and of life is another kind of word altogether and i am to your faith be it unto you if this be so then it is critical to raise the congregational expectancy to hear such a word but how shall that be if we who are preachers have not the faith to believe that we are speaking it that the congregation cannot rise above the level of its pastor his minister himself and if he does not believe that this is the word of God how shall they believe it so such an elevation of expectancy as faith needs to embrace needs to embrace our ministers as well perhaps what is needed is not only a heightened regard for speaking but for silence which is to say that if we have not a word that is given to announce that fact and not fill the silence and alleviate the tension by what we can so easily produce of ourselves God's going to test us and wants to see the depth of our jealousy for the word of God and yeah so the issue of speaking in the last analysis is the issue of silence the ability to suffer the tension of not hearing of having no speaking because our regard for true speaking is so great that we will not welcome any kind of equivalent or substitute and we would rather suffer the tension of silence than to fill it with some expedient thing that is good even biblical but this this is this is priestly this this is requires a jealousy for the glory of God and insistence that the word that we hear because you know what we don't need to have our ears filled with continual hearings six messages like that a year will suffice i don't know who said it it may have been lauren cunningham some wise brother said that pastors are breaking their heads to find some new word that will correlate the years of the years and what they need to hear is six or seven good messages in the year propounded again and again because they have sucked the marrow from the bone and that will more promote the maturity growth of the church than some novelty of a new word every week the whole the whole issue of the word proclamation and the hearing of it needs radically to be recast in these last days and that raises the issue of silence and silence raises the issue of maturity like last night can we abide the silence can we abide the tension of something that is not smoothly flowing and and being filled up with with something that occupies our ears our eyes because we're we're we're sensuous and voluptuous and we need to have something happening that's auditory or visible when those things do not happen do we come apart of the sins can we sit there in the peace of God and it's one thing to sit in the peace of God as a spectator but can you sit there in the peace of God as a participant or as one in oversight who's responsible for that night and there are people who have come as visitors and shouldn't we put our best foot forward and show them what we can really do to remain silent then and suffer the tension which is another say form of suffering and dying trusting and waiting but not every message is a thunderbolt or a home run or bombastic some of the most choked splutterings that we think well look at our prayers i may have mentioned this i love when i can feel the real surge of God's power in my prayer but i'll tell you there are other times that my prayers have been so limp i'm embarrassed to hear them coming out of my mouth and i always want to offer God apologies the best i'm able in the moment but i find that he answers those prayers equally as well as the prayers that have been registered with impact there are times when we'll leap like a lamb and there are other times we'll roar like the lion of juda the thing is it's not an hour of control the one or the other and accept that you're willing to be a lamb and to be faint voiced and weak and seemingly unanointed and watch the people drawn in your face you'll not be the same vessel that God will use to roar as the line of juda it's not for us not only am i not able and do not desire that i should form the word that determine its content i would not even want to touch the mode of the speaking and the mood of it that that is equally as much the province of God as the content the mood of the speaking and the manner of the speaking and some of you who have been through this with the lord know that when it pleases him you can't even lift your hands you can't make a gesture you can't add any schmaltz you can't give it a little zap you just stand there with your hands limply at your side and your voice goes off in the monotone you cannot even so much as fall to your voice now yeah are you willing to be so regulated and yet i've seen messages like that the holocaust message in 1977 was just like that it was not a powerful preaching statement it was a monotone read as an outline off of the yellow pages of the legal path but when it was over i have never seen a reaction to the word of God more powerful before or since in 28 years 2 000 people were absolutely devastated it was an historic event but it was read as a monotone and don't you think i wanted to give it a little zap a little i couldn't and i just resigned what i just knew the lord is at the console this is serving his purposes and maybe all the more to demonstrate to that people that this is not a response to an emotional or moving word but the word of God itself spent like matzah like unleavened bread flat ungainly no there's nothing attractive that we should desire it has no calmness that we should desire it it's the most unappealing insipid flat you know what matzah is flour and water period zero there's nothing added but there's nothing sweeter to the taste i remember in the depression years as a kid in brooklyn a little girl came out of the house with a piece of matzah letter and she said as a kid who could not afford it anyway she said you know the word it's the word that is the event not the stylistic presentation and maybe when we seek to bring a stylistic appreciation we rob the word of its power then relaxing into what Paul warned the eloquence so if it is bombast i want to say it's not because i'm trying to cut a figure and make a show because that's what the lord has called for in such a moment but there are other moments that have been monotone moments more powerful because of the word itself as the bread of life that has come down from heaven it's been given Paul had that apostolic jealousy and reverence instructing the church to pray for him that utterance may be given nothing the great apostle to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel that i might speak boldly as i want to speak you can take that word boldly and substitute that i might speak creatively that i might speak authoritatively that i might speak whatever is the grace that he's asking for that must be given as it comes down to one who will give that word faithfully without when you add something adulterated without adulteration to speak faithfully the word that is given and in the mood that God would have it to be spoken trust in the lord that his word will not go forthward because it has not a cotton-taking thing to do with your reputation what does that matter and God will trust that to a human vessel that could interject its own note its own voice its own personality where that boldness or authority is not expressed there the sermon stands a jeopardy of becoming mere ceremony an adjunct a piece of familiar and unsalging predictability it requires nothing from its healers and it makes no demand but only fills the space space which has but only fills the space space which has been made for it and there is no glory in the church we have only been sermonized the word has not come to us as event what is worse is that not only have we missed that which is creative but just the opposite has taken place we have been dulled in our spirits in our discernment in our spirituality to that measure we are incapacitated as God's agents in the world and constitute only a sleepy sunday religious culture which the world can well afford to ignore something happens when it's not the word of God it's not just that you're losing the word of God but you're something is happening of a negative kind namely a dullness a dullness to your spirit a dullness to your faculty of discernment you know the church is a holy place is the face is holy you can't transact and operate at other levels and think that it's without consequence of one kind or another if it will not be the creative word it'll be uncreative it will rob the hero it will dull the hero and we need to know that there's loss of what is more is that as nature abhors a vacuum the space which should have been filled with Godly content and spirit now invites murky and dubious substitutes only too anxious to provide themselves the whole explosion of high-tech electronic audio and visual entertainment together with the proliferation of bizarre half-nude rock star posters on the walls of the children of christians and even ministerial families is its own testimony there's something if we'll not provide an apostolic environment if there's not going to be a word that's bold and life-giving in that vacuum something will come to fill it and what i'm saying is as i travel and stay in ministerial homes and often in the bedrooms of the children of ministers i see the rock posters on the wall of that culture has captivated that generation because of a vacuum that was not filled by the power and the life and the authority of God in the world they heard in your sermonizing that leave them dull and untouched one of the testimonies of the work that God did in georgia in that last day where the body of christ was established by a word we had stayed up all night the night before till 11 or 12 o'clock discussing with men who had never been set in his elders should we do that tomorrow the apostolic brother is there i'm a prophetic brother maybe we should pray in these elders before them and that would make the fellowship of fellowship and church in fact and and i said no i said we're russian we're doing something human and political it's not right it's not organic it's not on time how can you even talk about eldership in government and authority when these people don't even have the concept of the body of christ it has not come to them as revelation they're putting the cart before the horse and that we went to bed close to midnight the next sunday was the final speaking time i had no message and somewhere and i don't know when in the early morning hours the lord just quickened something about poor conversion that's on the commencement of his life and God he was immediately inducted into the mystery of the body of christ so also why persecuted style me that to persecute the truth of God was to come against its head who is God and that he was blinded by the revelation of christ on the loads of Damascus and led by the hand of the child and remained in that condition three days and nights neither eating nor drinking until God and i a simple ordinary believer to lay hands on him and only by that provision was his blindness relieved and his doctors in the spirit of things that he had to receive from another member of the body his release and his life and religious phenomena like that but that word became an event i'll tell you how much it became the event the kids who usually sit in the back of the room the teenagers and the and those in puberty who wait for the thing to be over it's the parents thing you know their kids are not they're not expected to be related every single one of them came up to the front of the building broken weeping and repentant for their alienation and separation from the thing in which God had called their their families and one by one they all came up and made testimonies like that and ended up by saying please pray for me and sat down and i thought well no isn't anyone going to pray no one prayed and when they all got finished then the lord quickened now have them all come up again and set out chairs in the front of the room for all of them and let the four men who have never been set in as elders pray for them in behalf of the body and in that act the elders were set in without an explicit word of ordination and from that day forth everyone knows who the elders are and they have gone from becoming a fellowship to becoming an expression of the body of christ in barnesville georgia by the word that came of such an event that even kids in their puberty and adolescence were inducted and brought in we need to have more expectation for this and more trust and if it doesn't come we might well and properly fear for our younger generation drawn to to the pop culture the high tech crud and the video visual things that that the um vacuum calls for we have not persuaded our children about the the authenticity of what we're about and that's the real measure whether we have attained it the word amuse the negation of thinking and contemplation speaks for itself you know that when you preface any word with the letter a atheist theist means God to put the letter a means the denial of what follows amuse is the denial of musing and musing is to reflect to think and to ponder you ever think of that amusement is a flight from serious consideration and we are a generation that must be amused because what is there in the church i mean how many who sat in last night could really have appreciated it if they could not see it or hear it by the eye or ear of the spirit inga wanted to know what happened when i got home said nothing much was two people sharing a simple night how do you how do you describe it no fireworks the historically recent event of nazism in lutheran germany is a sobering illustration germany is a sobering illustration of the societal consequences for such a vacuum as i am describing it describing into it came the powerful demonically inspired rhetoric of a hitler that hypnotized an entire nation isn't that interesting the paradox that in a lutheran germany whose sermons were likely as dry as dust sermonizing believers sunday after sunday into that vacuum came a demonically inspired and anointed ballroom creep whose power of rhetoric was of such a kind as to hypnotize an entire nation even today when you hear if you don't even understand german there's a vibration and a power of a compelling kind that issued from that man it's almost God's mock on a church that failed to proclaim the word an apostolic power that he allowed raised up this satanic alternative and we will inherit the same unless we seek to it the else the alternatives to the absence of authoritative preaching are too painful then to contemplate should we continue in our present indifference learning to live comfortably without the glory of God is our norm how long one might ask before the privilege of hearing the real word is removed very likely a church unbeknownst to itself is following very much in the pattern of the apostate Israel that preceded it can it be or is it already so that the prophetic words of amos are applicable to us behold the days come say the lord God that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor of thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord not the least of our ministerial sins is the man-pleasing casual and general character of our public address we compliment ourselves if our message was quote biblical if there was some note of moral instruction that one could choose to draw from it so much the better but certainly we are not implying that we mean you in our preaching or that you're having heard our words puts you under any certain obligation how out of tune is the whole tenor of Paul's exhortation to timothy and second timothy for preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine evidently to preach the word was not meant to give a homily on a biblical text but to be particular pointed and uncompromising in confronting the saints with the condition of their lives and the necessity for change there's another statement that's worth the whole price of the five weeks a whole definition of what preaching the word is apostolically and biblically not providing a homily on a biblical text but confronting rebuking exhorting with all long suffering and doctrine it's a word that is addressed to the condition and life and need of the people being spoken to and they know it they're not coming to hear some abstract some general statement about the scripture which is enjoyable to contemplate they're going to hear something pointed to their life their condition and their need preach the word Paul said to timothy the solemnity of Paul's charge and about and the high seriousness and eternal accountability of it would terrify many of us today i challenge thee therefore before God said Paul and the lord Jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing at his kingdom perhaps in our age of professionalism and being credentialed rather than being apostolically charged this is exactly what is remiss but that too is only a symptom of the yet larger problem the substitution of the glory of God in the church for a man pleasing ethos appropriately in timothy in verse five timothy is told to endure afflictions evidently the inevitable consequence for men who preach the word and no matter what no matter the response of the hearers if you're going to preach a word like that you need to endure afflictions carl bach another great swiss theologian senses these things and sums them up sums up the crisis of preaching in these words preaching is an attempt undertaken with human means which are in all respects inadequate here a man cannot rely on his own resources but in the eyes of God who raises the dead and brings to life that which is not the attempt is a good work to which his promise and his blessings are attached but only in so far as it is undertaken by his command carl bach was a great preacher as well as theologian in fact this theology was always related to the subject of preaching theology was for preaching even this last three minds are all together the the critical points in the matter throws the entire weight on the condition of faith of the preacher himself that is to say is he in that quality of relationship with God by which he can even himself discern what God is commanding to be spoken if the word preaches the word commanded are we in a place with God to hear that command or are we just free to ramble through our concordance and find an appropriate subject and and work out a biblically sound message about it and present it do we even have the faith to believe that there's a word that God would command if all of the works of God were established before the foundations of the earth were laid doesn't that include this sunday's message isn't that the reason why we cannot ourselves devise a curriculum for these weeks had the trust for unfolding that could only come from God but are we in a relationship with God by which that unfolding could be revealed no wonder that men have repressed their concordances they have not the relationship they cannot believe for have not the faith which is saying the same thing to hear a command of the word that is to be spoken clearly if we are going to have an apostolic word a creative word that performs the work and then to hear it it will come from men who are not ruled by the fear of man but of God only such a one will have the incentive necessary to wait upon him and a communion sufficient to seek him for the word that he commands instead of being up frantically late saturday night or early sunday morning to polish the sermon we'll spend our time in the holiest place of all time in the holiest place of all coming into the presence of the shekinah glory of God and waiting there where he said there i will commune with you and meet with you and there i will give you in commandment instruction for the sons of Israel very few of us have the faith to believe that such a place is available and that we can wait there and receive it and you know that when you receive it i pray like that this morning in fact virtually every morning but i don't say that i know that word is being given in that moment i'm asking for it i'm believing for it and i'm in that place of faith before that presence but that's not to say that something is clicking and and the bells are going off and i know what that is but that i've got to proceed as believing that in the moment of delivery that that it will be given although sometimes indeed the lord does clearly communicate the actual word it's not more than a matter of coincidence that the very sending of Paul by the holy ghost that initiated his apostolicity comes in that moment in x 13 as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said that it is in the place of communion and they're waiting before the lord by men who are just as content to remain as to go that the holy ghost sent the word separate unto me and if that's the way in which their apostolic careers had their origin by what basis did their apostolic ministries continue the same way by which the word came out of communion is the same way by which the word must continue in the unfolding of the apostolic career so there was Paul caught with his pants down so to speak on mars hill not even ever attending to be there brought there by circumstance fleeing persecution brought by other brothers and left waiting until others would catch up with him and while he waited he saw the city given over to idolatry and his heart was pierced and he grieved and he found himself in the marketplace talking with the the the the philosophers and with the jews and and they brought him up to mars hill and wanted to hear what this babbler had to say who speaks some strange doctrine about resurrection so Paul standing on mars hill all eternity hanging in the moment the whole history of the faith at stake facing the toughest audience that a hebrew could face namely greek philosophers with a very antithesis of what he represented as a traveling kind of itinerant preaching bum he said i observed the inscription at the base of your monuments to the unknown God and him whom you ignorantly worship i declare unto you boom he started out with an insult whap right in the face of men who prided themselves for being intellectual whom you ignorantly worship you cop outs you want to remain ignorant you don't want to know a living God who requires something who has 10 commandments who says thou shalt not you want to be fornicating philosophers and and delude yourself to think that you're looking for the deep and the ultimate things of reality and of God and always seeking but never coming to the knowledge because you don't want it deep in your hearts him whom you ignorantly choose not to know i little skunky babbler will declare unto you in the authority of God and i'll tell you every man who heard that statement that day completely unpremeditated given in the moment is accountable before God eternally only one apostolic hearing is all that anyone ever needs or deserves after that you're accountable before God how come he had that word did he did he devise it and making notes on his way up to the ascent of marcel somewhere earlier in the day in his times of communion with God he waited before the presence of the most time not knowing what the day would bring and who was sufficient for these things but God remembered and in the moment of requirement he had a word for which all which men will be accountable eternally so the ability to wait to have communion to seek him for the work that he commands is the issue it's not a matter of coincidence that the very sending of Paul is already said came as they minister to the lord we need to be reminded that the veil is rent that there is a God that business enter boldly that there's a place of communion available in the holiest place of all above the arch of between the chair of them at the mercy seat of God and in his second our presence where his intimate whisper can be heard shall he not give us the way with all to command as well the words of command will he not give us the way with all to command as well as the words of command and shall it not come to us in the very same place has not our teaching as our preaching been too much about God rather than of God because we had been too little with God uh there i will meet with the there in the place of intercom intimate communion we're getting to the real nub of the matter the whole issue of authority in the church was it some hot shot who can raise his voice who has some facility to crack things off and and crack the whip and do this and do that and has extrapolated verses from Paul and knows how to administer them to the churches that makes them apostolic uh well authority is relative to the knowledge of God in intimate communion or it's not authority and that will distinguish the false apostles from the true and our ability to to discern the one from the other is relative to our communion with God if we have not that that that communion will be impressed with these flaky substitutes and these hot shots and loud mouths who are able and capable and will miss the guy who falters and stumbles and chokes and splutters and and is called a battler and the last analysis is not this what the world is dying for the communication of very God himself is not this the apostolic message the foundation of the church and all reality itself can there be any communion between men that has not first been preceded by communion with God if we are sufficiently gripped with the mandate which is ours as the ministers of his word we must say with Paul who is sufficient for these things and the great apostle answers his own question with appropriate apostolic meekness not that we are fit i'm going to see it for his jewish reflection reflection not that we are fit qualified and sufficient that our ability of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything that's coming from us of course he's counted anything that might have served for that is done but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God it is he who has qualified us making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient as ministers and dispensers of their new covenant what is the genius of apostolic transmission God God and the vital experience and consciousness of the apostolic communicator the God who anoints what he himself alone appoints to live in the knowledge of that God is also to speak out of his presence and also that we will be held accountable for every other word we speak my brethren let not many of you become teachers knowing that we shall all receive strict judgment therefore does Paul conclude and i also for we are not like so many as hucksters making the trade of peddling God's word measuring it short an adulterating the divine message but as men of sincerity and the purest motive commissioned and sent by God we speak his message in christ the messiah in the very sight and the presence of God that's my concluding quotation because there are many hucksters many glib facile communicators as many who adulterate temper take the sharp edge off make it humanly and religiously acceptable but he says as men of sincerity and the purest motive i would underline the word men flesh and blood men commissioned and sent by God we speak his message in christ in the very sight in presence of God Paul was always conscious of this the judge we shall be accountable for all that we have done in our bodies both good and bad everything is before God isn't that what elijah said is the lord my God lives he wasn't just making a statement about God's durability but the very presence of the God continually brooding for whom he had the highest accountability and nothing is calculated to break the fear of God for preachers than this knowledge this God to whom we are accountable he's invisible but the congregation is very visible with their arms folded waiting for you to to perform some spiritual roulette that though they were up late at night in front of the tv set you're going to come up with some dynamic now and wake them up out of their lethargy and rouse them and after all that's why they're paying you a handsome salary everything is stacked against apostolic and prophetic proclamation it waits for men who are indifferent to their reputations and even more than that to the issue of their livelihood maybe we men need to be encouraged to refuse their salaries coming from their congregation and say no i'm sorry i appreciate this but i feel that i need to trust God for my subsistence i cannot be dependent on the measure that comes from you it will unconsciously even affect the way in which i conceive and bring the word the word well let's pray for the word of God which is to say for the proclamation that comes from men oh who wait upon him who are accountable to him only who are jealous insanely for his glory who can bear the reproach of men their disappointment even their accusations their rebukes to be told that they're loveless that they're doing harm to the body of christ the most ironic contradictions are the very things for which they're giving their lives so lord how about a commissioning this morning of men who are to be sent in the last days to hold fast the word of life to proclaim that to set it forth before your people whether they will hear it whether they will reject it for your words shall not go forth void it'll bring salvation or it'll bring judgment but let it be the word of your command that has not its origin in our heads and is not performed out of our ability the word of life comes from your deepest dearest heart that can only be consulted in that holy place where you wait for men who will come in dependence before you in a faith believing that out of that communion will come in commandment instruction for the sons of Israel so let there be a commissioning my God hearing the cry of a heart here and in this room who will say send me willing to jeopardize everything that has up to now been obtained in the affection and esteem of men and even the material compensations which have come and lord even as we pray for ourselves as preachers the holy calling we pray for our congregations we pray my God for the church we pray that elevation of the word of God the respect for it the willingness to hear it to receive it as exhortation or rebuke and not as homily on a biblical theme are people who want to grow up are people who want to come of age are people who want to be addressed want to be required of want a word that will compel something from them that's costly lord we ask something for the church in this hour precious God that when our brothers shall return to their places not only has something happened to them in these weeks but something has happened to those to whom you've called them and who have indeed sent them intuitively in the hope of something of this kind a qualitative breakthrough of coming into a place of transcendence transcendence that makes the words apostolic and prophetic more than cliche more than a new novelty but the awesome thing that they were at the first and must again be at the last commission my God this morning seal and send men who will bear your word without compromise they'll speak it in your mood they'll not take the edge off of it consciously or unconsciously to make it acceptable lord give us a renewed respect a reverence for the phenomenon of preaching you can validate that commission by a prayer of your own uh the human flesh really he found it was willing to give itself to them and as rea said i'm a man of unclean lips but lord my desire is that you apply the cold the words to my eyelids that they might come out and be the kind of command that you spoke to me that life may come from those people that you uh just bear myself available to you and thank you lord you have to endure much affliction call said if you preach to women as exploitation and as rebuke yes well yeah no higher call there is no higher call than to preach the word of God uh my house a privilege i surrender my house me i asked for a desire and i will encourage the preach to obey whether i asked for a desire to see your finger in the heaven whether it's a scary thing to ask but i asked to be accountable to you i asked for a calling i asked for a higher calling i asked it's calling your glory that you may be lifted up and i may be put down i'm going to your glory of your kingdom your love and your holy 12 days of my life watch your feet and obey your words i'm going to my life but i thank you for the love and the grace thank you for your love and your grace thank you for these people for their love their honesty and willingness to serve i know beyond the shadow of the doubt if you will honor their prayers you will honor their hearts you will honor the kingdom because of them you will raise us up as a mighty force to lead us on so they have to care to give you the glory about themselves thank you thank you for that willingness it was an honor to be in the presence of people it was a true honor there's very few men that he can to do you know 10 days in her life the honor is a true person of God so i know you've not called me to preach but you have called me to give in word and season and even one word lord can carry the power to change lives and because of that because of the love for you i too today renew a covenant with you that i will spend time in communion with you in your holy place lord to be changed and be prepared for that one word that will come out at any time and i will not know when it will come lord i i i submit my life i submit any fear of man even man meaning my closest friends and relatives my family so i just i will not let anything any kind of reputation to hinder the word that would come forth through me as your vessel lord purify me in all senses of the word lord in every area every oh God i lay myself before you i lay myself on your altar for your purifying work and i pray that in communion with you that you will lead me into that person you can carry your word at a moment's notice within this necessary award i thank you for the honor i thank you for the privilege i bow down before you i'm glad to meet you you know for example um so okay i cry out to you for grace upon praise but i know that the baptist boy in the wilderness knew a lot of truth but he was waiting he was confined to wait till he would okay but i pray that there be a restoration such a jealousy lord i i uh i think at the standard but i love it and God i'd only be happy with nothing just ask you God and our faith should not rest in the wisdom of men but in the wisdom of God that Jesus christ was the wisdom of God and the power of God in the spirit you may know this what causes community in the future place that you can be more sensitive to hear your words when you come out of that and the confidence in you just thank you lord to promise me the word so we will have life thank you and help me to live a life it really takes over and how the life of the acknowledging that i'm not my own and what was the first you were the conqueror i am the clay and i say father have your own way and thank you for your eternal faithfulness to hear a cry and hold this to us i pray even now also for every word that is coming forth God when you would see fit to take family away and take things away father i pray that everyone here would remember the vows this morning yes well father your word is truth and your word is lies and it's better that the vows than the vows of messiah before the holy one of Israel you are in the spirit of God you are a God who expects uh in return for what is spoken and we thank you for that this morning father and that you're the way that you are and that you require for temple and renting for every word for the blessing for the father say thank you father i thank you for david's words i know you want to watch your way i want to run but i can't do that lord i put myself at your feet in regard to this word i ask that i feel this is a sense of not this avoidance in myself it's a kind of nothingness the more you claim this other nothingness i pray that you will do that in my life that i will be willing to be your way whatever that cost uh thank you that you've shown us again just circumstances of bringing people together and and a word that is spoken from you and to bear that reproach lord that our lives could just be an example and a witness a testimony of the things that you desire lord and pray now that it can be that voice in the earth lord that distinct sound that would sound forth the heavenly desire the the power of your word to change lord when it's spoken father God thank you for for bringing us here and forming our lives and once again just renewing that that relationship that bond that commitment that covenant and our devotion to you would be pure lord we just be broken before you lord precious God lord i thank you for the word this morning thank you it's a heavy word lord but Paul said your grace is sufficient we are strengthening our weakness yes lord you've been in my life for 12 years lord and not once do i regret doing your will i don't know the implications where you want me to go where you're going to leave me lord and i know you're loving God i know you see me through you you love always be intact in my heart and in no way i can be pleased other than doing your will because when you're pleased i'm pleased i thank you for the oneness you're establishing my heart with you lord and lord i credit my brothers and sisters don't look at this as a heavy weight that they gotta carry because lord you're always carrying us thank you father i've seen hard times lord and sometimes you wish you were never in them but when you come out of them i know that it was all worth it thank you that there's something far more glorious on the other side and that's part of the christian life living by faith and trusting that you're not a hard cast master for the loving God that leads his flock into liberty and freedom yes to be what we ought to be what we created to be a real people who love a living and real God thank you lord so lord i just pray following the prophet and your saints and i know lord that you lead us that you lead us properly can you lead us into life into love so lord i don't know what my commission is lord i think you paid my day i don't think i'm here by goodness i don't know my exact call i'm more incapable probably than anybody here so be it lord be seen these days according to thy will i love you lord praise Jesus thank you lord for bringing us to this high mountain in part and giving us a glimpse of transfiguring things yes may we hear again the eternal voice of the father that was sounded then and sounds still hear ye him and hearing him all of the awesome implications of that hearing may we also hear be not afraid and we won't be afraid in our being thank you because you said so you spoke a word into our being crazy and we're not to be afraid and so we thank you and we just put aside the feelings of fear and the intimidation of what this will require you've spoken whenever we will see the transfiguring thing and hear you you the ultimate requirement of it always comes also your word not just given as a comfort as an event yes being not afraid coming thank you okay or just thank you lord and these are many who are buried under the ground they will arrive and your enemies will be scattered and their enemies will be scattered and your avoidance will occur whether they are great you go to a little scatter you have an eye every one your eye is on the scatter and lord the fallen ones buried one and lord you will raise them up and i pray lord you speak to us you bring up those who are buried more those who aspire those who feel nothing anymore my God you have the power to do it yes and i pray lord you will raise them up to no glory and honor this is the will of him that has sent me a bit of all which he has given me i should lose nothing is the end of all people explaining far down below every other time do yes God i'll give us that saw in mary and she said feed unto me according to that will that word i'm excusing and knowing that pregnancy without being married in those days was such a approach but lord she loved you with all her heart and was willing to go through that lord give us that kind of heart you wouldn't even flinch when you asked us to do your will thank you this book helps us that human blood calls it calls the dark yes it's a cult that was for mary feed up to be according to that word stoning at the doorstep of the father every biblical requirement for the this gracing God immorality that could not be explained lord so gracious God may you grant us something virginal like that wherever there's been compromised by wherever we have depended upon our own eloquence even the gifting which is given rather than upon you yourself he asked that we might take up the knife and the fire against it thank you bring us to a personal place of an utter dependency and willingness the stuff of what obedience has always required that the earth will hear your voice that the word can come forth my God out of zion i would use it as a metaphor thank you your word again word of spirit and the black even of the kind that you spoke for us we want that to be overcome by the blood of the land and by the word of our testimony that we know blood not even our life we should pray for the struggle in this area of proclamation such a vessel of the rich remarkable application of the things of God but somehow it doesn't come out as it were and to be released whatever the stoppage whatever the the blockage removal at least on the basis of the consecration to the ascent point lord we we don't know how to pray this one Jesus don't want to miss the moment either it may come low for yourself and we ask precious God that as you made Paul and you should make others you'll make it also an able minister of the new covenant grant my God a divine precious whatever it is my God that lies too deep for words a fear of man of insecurity of how he's heard received up to this point in our faith may it may you dissipate it given by God a whole trust and confidence that however complex things my God the need to be mediated and they know that healed and understood will grant them a great simplicity of utterance look given of God that they might be given by God God that they might be given by God a a quality of speaking relative to depth of insight and understanding that you've and equally with a humility my God that he will be humbled each time he hears you bringing forth these complex things and setting them before your people with clarity time and with power let today be a turning point work something in the deeps of release as proclaimer Jesus just as you call Lazarus so in love with j temptation he's a treasure whatever um thank you yes lord you've said to us today that we're not to to be concerned if all we have is a little sputtering or mutterings or a little something lord we don't have a grand plan for what we're doing lord and what i've heard you say to us is that we're not to judge that more not to find fault with what you desire to speak through us lord and i just speak that word also for reggie lord that he not judge what you give him lord that he trusts you to use the little thing that he gives whatever it is lord it is satisfactory it pleases you but that is from you and not from him it's a thing that brings life it's a command it's word made live by you so just give him peace lord not to judge the words that come out of his mouth lord but the rest in those that they came from the mount thank you lord is so great you were always faithful to speak be strong and a good courage father we just pray that you can be strong and good courage and father we know that that strength and that courage is of you we'd also ask that you would call me to be content with the with the much that you have given them it's not a little and father if there is a wrong kind of a discontentment and a seeking of more rather than being greatly appreciative for what you have given cause you to be appreciative of it so you may never give him nothing more you know all the all that he ever has or needs he's already had let him realize let all of us realize that father it's much that they've been given uh just in light of of the measure and truth that has been given and so we just pride that he could be strong and of good courage and extremely grateful for the measure given and and and thankful
