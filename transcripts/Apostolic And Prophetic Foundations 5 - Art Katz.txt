Apostolic And Prophetic Foundations 5 - Art Katz

For the so great God that you are, for the so great salvation you have given, for the so great mysteries given to us, revealed to us, not for our contemplation only, for our fulfillment, to conclude the age, to bring your coming and your kingdom. What privilege, what call, what enablement. Come my God this morning, pour out your soul. You have prepared us in these days to hear you, to receive your word, to take it to our hearts, to do it, let it be historic my God. Deep, deep, deep into the foundations of the church, unto eternal consequence and glory. You are speaking this day from the throne of heaven through earthly lips. In Jesus name we pray.

Amen. May be seated. So let me begin with a question. Is Paul a systematic theologian? Yes or no? How many would say yes? How many would say no? How many would not say? You rather keep it to yourself. It's something private and personal. Don't get nosy cats. You want my opinion? Brilliant as Paul was. He was not systematic. That's why he has given employment to generations of theologians thereafter. It's for us to make sense of him. He writes like a fool. Like a man beside himself. It's for us to sift. And to bring some order and understanding. And I can't think of a more precious employment. You wrestle with Paul. It will transform your life. So let me ask another question. Though he's not systematic, of all the letters that he has written, which one would be the most comprehensive?

The most carefully deliberated statement of his whole apostolic mindset.

Which book? You're afraid to say. Good, too good. Anyone else? It's Romans. It's Romans.

Hebrews is also good.

Superb.

The authorship of Ephesians is considered by the scholars questionable.

Romans is unquestionably Paul.

There he lays out the whole logic of God's sin, salvation, redemption.

16 chapters, I think. Now, what is the heart of that book? chapters 9 through 11.

The mystery of Israel and the church.

Superb. It's not something to be found at the back of the book. It's not for Paul an afterthought. A little asterisk with some concluding thoughts. It's his central thought.

The issue of Israel for Paul is central to his whole apostolic mindset. Not because he's a Jew, but because he's an apostle.

That's a very important point.

You mustn't think that Paul is putting forward a perspective about Israel because it's a subject necessarily dear to himself.

Unquestionably, it is dear.

He begins chapter 9 by crying, I will wish myself a curse for my brethren's sake, that they might know Christ.

He's not indifferent to the condition of his kinsmen.

But if God had chosen Pygmies as being the elect nation, that would have been the subject of Romans 9 through 11. God has elected and chosen Israel, not because it's greatest, but because it's least. And Paul calls his whole exposition a mystery.

Do you like that word? Do you love that word? We're not talking about detective stories. Paul said, I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery. How does Paul use the word?

A mystery is something that has until now been concealed.

Something of an ultimately precious kind.

Kept by God for a moment in his own choosing. When it shall be revealed by his spirit to those who can perceive it.

That will be on your examination. What is a mystery? As Paul understands the word. And as you should understand it. But you need to love the mysteries of it. Are there juices running in your mouth? And you don't have it yet. Where does Paul say, I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery?

The book of Romans.

Chapter 11. The concluding chapter of 9 through 11.

And then he says, lest you become wise in your own conceit. The loss of this mystery brings unhappy consequence. When we lose this mystery, it brings unhappy consequences. Paul is pleading with the church in Rome.

Who have asked Paul a practical question.

Has God finished with the Jews?

Is Israel pass√©?

Who have stoned all the prophets that were sent unto him? And crucified the son of glory?

And judgment is about to break upon them? Are they now finished with the purposes of God? They've had their chance. And they've blown it. And now we assume their call.

And we fulfill, as the Israel of God, the destiny that had been given them.

No small question. Two thousand years later, it's still being debated.

And great segments of the church have spurned Paul's explanation in their own arrogance and conceit to relegate to themselves the Israel of God. And look upon Israel as finished. Yes, individual Jews can be saved. It's nice to have you in the church, Brother Katz. But Israel as a nation, no destiny.

Finito. It's over. That's called replacement theology.

It not only does disservice to Israel, it is tragic in its consequence for the church. For the way in which the church perceives and beholds Israel is the key to its own perception of itself. The church cannot even be understood independently of Israel. The church itself is a mystery, born out of Israel's judgment. The branches that had been broken off that you might be grafted in to their roots. You are an interim, a continuation of a most holy faith, once and for all given to saints, forfeited by Israel as a nation, with the rejection of its messiah, but continued by a remnant to whom you have been joined.

Do you know why I'm pausing with every word? I am so conscious this morning.

God is speaking to the church of Latin America through these tapes, a word that must come, decisive for all its future. For the church that does not recognize the mystery, and consciously and willfully embraces it, and recognizes its mandate toward Israel, forfeits its identity as the church. It can continue to function, have its services in its programs, but it has forfeited being an apostolic entity, employed by God for the fulfillment of mystery that concludes the age. As I hope to show you this morning, the mystery of Israel embraced is the making of the church, because it is an ultimate requirement, requiring an ultimate fulfillment that compels the church to become the church, as an apostolic entity, and to fulfill the mystery on the ground of resurrection, not as a doctrine to which it gives approval, but the source of its life and being, its energy, its power, and its authority, or Israel will remain dead in its grave.

See, I'm already speaking mysteries. You're already confused. But don't panic.

This is complicated, unspeakably rich, and we will explore this.

Paul said, I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery. Is that right?

Lest you become wise in your own conceit.

Listen to this. That it's not just, well, you've missed something that might have enriched you. To miss this is to miss all.

To miss this condemns you to a certain conceit, a certain ecclesiastical pride, a conceit of arrogance, not only toward Israel, but toward everything. You become inflated, pompous, self-assured, loud, and that is no longer the church. It has lost its essential character. The meekness of the lamb himself. Nothing keeps us more humble than the magnitude of the mandate exclusively given to us toward Israel.

It tempers us. It gives a right resonance to our corporate atmosphere.

When the mystery is understood, received willfully, consciously, and walked out. It does not require a great preponderance of Jews in your locality. Though I feel sure that before the end of the age, you might be astonished at the numbers that pass through. A flight from global persecution called the Time of Jacob's Trouble, in which God will sift them through the nations. All nations, the prophet Amos says, so that not only shall Israel be sifted, but the nations themselves.

Let's look at the text. Romans chapter 11.

The conclusion to Paul's remarkable statement of the mystery given him as an apostle, as a steward of the mysteries of God. So precious are they in God's sight.

This is not merchandise for us to traffic in.

This is taking off our shoes and holding our breath as we come to a sacred ground, unspeakably dear in God's sight. The conclusion of the ages. What Paul says in this chapter, if the falling away of them has become the blessing to the Gentiles, then what shall their return be but life from the dead?

That's extravagant language, but it's not excessive. How does Paul end this chapter? Let's look at that first.

Let's go to the end before the beginning, because in verses 33-36 we have the most glorious paean of praise, ecstatic utterance of praise in the whole holy writ. There is nothing to which it can be compared. It even exceeds the psalmist.

It's Paul's final ecstatic outburst.

As he has reviewed and laid out this mystery, that something has broken so upon his deepest consciousness of the wisdom of God, of the genius of God, in this remarkable scheme of Israel's last day's restoration after a history of apostasy through the church that he breaks out in language that he can't contain. Oh, the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

Can you see him waving back and forth like his legs are going out from under him? This is ecstatic joy. Sublime revelation, like a man drunk.

Oh, the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments, his ways past finding out.

Where did you see that?

In the subject of Israel, and especially, there is a revelation of God in such a depth and magnitude that takes your breath away, that is staggering, that made all of our past revelations trite, that we have to clap our hands over our mouths, about God, to say we don't know as we ought to know, until we've seen God in this. When this breaks upon our hearts, when we see the revelation of this mystery, that God has not forsaken his original people, that there's a massive scheme here that brings an ultimate consummation to the eternal praise of his glory. Then the mystery of Israel is the revelation of God, as he in fact is, and must be known, and set forth before men. And it's a mystery the Church has not known merely to have a sentimental disposition toward the present state of Israel, or to agree that they deserve to have their own statehood, is in no way a statement of the mystery. In fact, if you can receive this, I often say to charismatic churches that have this kind of sentimental affiliation, and love to run to Israel for Feast of Tabernacles, conferences, and plant trees, and pinch the cheeks of Jews, because they think we're so cute. Your sentimental view is as much opposed to the perception of God as those who are wholly anti-Semitic. And when the bottom falls out, as it certainly will, and Israel will disappoint you in your vain expectations, you'll be the first to oppose them.

Harsh words, Katz, but true.

Well then, where is safety in the word of God, to have the view of Israel, which is apostolic, and is your privilege today, that in all of our times together, precious though they were, which I didn't know when I began, but I realize it now.

We're on a divine course in effecting church history, just in these days, and in this class.

How unsearchable are His judgments in His ways past finding out. For who has known the mind of the Lord?

Who has been His counselor?

Who has first given to Him and shall be given to Him again?

Now listen to this final verse. Have it inscribed on your heart. Learn how to sing it.

It's the summation of everything that can be considered apostolic. That nowhere is brought out in greater fullness in the penetrating light than in the mystery of Israel. For of Him, this mystery is of Him, for Israel's restoration, after thousands of years of apostasy, of the rejection and the crucifixion of the Holy One of Israel Himself, that would have been seen as a last straw that would finally justify God forsaking them, that would finally justify God forsaking them, that would finally justify God forsaking them, shows God in another depth, of whom Paul says in Romans 11, the gifts and the callings of God are irrevocable. He will never forsake them. He will never forsake them. He's not a God who forsakes.

He's faithful when we don't abide faithful.

When He gives a gift and a calling to Israel or to us, you shall be unto me a peculiar people, a nation of priests and a light unto the world that that shall not be fulfilled because of the unwillingness of the nation itself. No, the name of God is at stake. His honor is at stake. His power is at stake. And if that is not fulfilled, despite the nation, because His Word has said so, and you will be that despite yourself.

Do you think they share this perspective? Not a bit. They're not even interested to hear. What they want to become is like all other nations.

That the rich Jordanians can come to Jerusalem to go shopping. That the rich Jordanians can come to Jerusalem to go shopping and buy their Gucci leather handbags the most supreme merchandise available in the world. It's as if God has chosen for Himself the most difficult people.

The most unworthy. The most undeserving.

That God has not chosen Israel for its virtue.

It hasn't.

But that through it He might all the more demonstrate His mercy. The issue of Israel is God. More revealed as God in Israel's failure than in Israel's success. That the Lord will not allow Israel to initiate or fulfill anything in itself.

Why?

Because we Jews are supremely man. Because we Jews are self-assured.

Supremely capable.

Who else could have established a modern nation in 50 years? Who else could have established a modern nation in 50 years? Who else could have established a modern nation in 50 years? And small, low in numbers? Among the top three great military powers of the world. Among the top three great military powers of the world.

Number one air force. With nuclear capability. High tech civilization.

In 50 years, it's a staggering accomplishment that only Jews could perform. Who had been saved out of Hitler's gas ovens. But that does not glorify God.

But man.

And Israel has a destiny. Because God had promised its father Abraham. From your loins, out of your loins, a nation that will bless all the families of the earth. Present Israel might impress, but it cannot bless in its present condition. Israel stands for man. And God has to settle something.

Of a cosmic kind.

Who is supreme in creation. The God who created it.

Or the creature himself. Made in his image.

And endowed with remarkable capability. And would seek to be a God unto himself.

There's a great question at stake here.

Of why God must humble the nation.

Break it in its pride. Bring it to its death. Just like us. Just like us. To a newness of life.

That will bless all the families of the earth. There's a death that precedes a resurrection. And a suffering that precedes a glory. This is the wisdom of God. This is the genius of God. This is structured right into reality itself. And its final demonstration to all the world and all the nations will come through Israel itself.

It's a great mystery. I did not invent it. Paul didn't invent it.

It's God's genius. And it's through him.

What does that mean?

Israel cannot succeed at this. And nor can we. In being to Israel what we must. We might have succeeded with other issues on the basis of our well-meaning intentions but in the issue of Israel and Israel's restoration. Nothing that is in us that is religious or human or skilled can suffice. This mystery must be fulfilled through him.

We are the instrument.

He is the enabler.

And you're observing it this morning. What do you mean, brother? I'm not setting forth this mystery on the basis of my own experience or my own skills even though I do have substantial human gifts. And yes, I've spoken the subject before.

But this morning and every single time it must itself be a resurrection phenomenon.

I had every intention of beginning with the text and we have yet to come to it because I'm not in charge of this.

This mystery is too precious to God to allow a man to propound it. So I want you to believe me that the very proclamation this morning the setting forth of one word after another the precept by precept, the line upon line is not my doing but his. The speaking itself is a resurrection phenomenon later on you'll realize. But it raises this question that it's not for man to play with this the dabble in this that the Lord Himself in the power of His own life must set this forth as proclamation What then will it take to fulfill it?

That's all whistled together. Did you get the point? You know what you're going to say for the first time? When you get the point? You never said it before. Who is sufficient for these things? It's ultimate requirements. Ultimate mandate.

Beyond any ability in ourselves to fulfill independent of His power. Israel is going to be saved through the resurrection glory by a church who lives and moves and has its being in it or it will not be saved at all.

Well meaning intentions will not do it.

No wonder the carnal church is celebrating present Israel.

No wonder they want that the Zionist experiment to succeed.

That will absolve them from this requirement to be the key itself to Israel's resurrection on the basis of the church's own appropriation of the resurrection life.

You say why should anybody be afraid of that? Who doesn't want to move and live and have their being in that life? There's only one catch.

There's no resurrection without a death. There's no resurrection without a death.

And that's what they want to avoid. Both for them and for us.

Can't Ishmael live? Can't Israel succeed? Isn't it enough just to sentimentally identify ourselves with the nation?

Let's look at the text. Paul's writing and teaching came out of practical circumstances.

To answer the questions of the church. And the church is asking in Italy, is God finished with Israel? Has God cast away His people?

Verse 1 of chapter 11? Certainly not. You could not be more emphatic. God forbid you should even think that.

You can almost sense the apostolic indignation.

Where did you even get the thought?

Of course He has not cast them away.

What kind of a God do you think this is? Some fickle deity? On today and off tomorrow?

He's the enduring God. His mercies endure forever. And His love was never based on our qualification.

It was not in response to our attractiveness. Our virtue.

It was because He's God. And that's what He is in Himself.

He's love.

And He will not cast away. And if we haven't learned it in any other way, then may we learn it in Israel. For God's dealings with Israel is our textbook.

Where does he say that? In Roman sub-heaven.

Because if you don't behold it, you don't behold God. I love God's mercy, brother.

But have you beheld His severity? You can't have the one without the other.

Or you have a God of your own making.

One that you've shaped.

His mercy, His love, His kindness, His goodness. Yes, that's true of God.

What about His wrath? What about His judgment? What about His severity? What about His chastisement? To exclude those things. You put a label on them.

But it's not the God who is God.

If you choose to ignore His severity. What is His mercy without His severity?

Mercy doesn't mean anything.

Except that it comes in response to His severity.

As a matter of fact, in the last analysis, His severity is His mercy.

Do you know God like that? How then shall you make Him known?

Who does not know their own God and waits for that revelation through you.

Let's go to verse 11. Paul takes up the same question. Have they stumbled that they should fall? That their rejection is permanent? God forbid, certainly not. Then what was the purpose of it?

In order to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles.

Are you ready? You didn't know it.

You would not have salvation at all if not for their fall. That the faith of the God of Israel, the God of Jacob has come to you who were far off and without God in the world, drinking beer out of skulls and performing human sacrifices and cutting out the living hearts of your victims on your Mayan altars, pagans and idolaters and murderers in darkness. But God in His mercy has extended His grace to you who were far off and without God. And what the Mayans were celebrating for God, ever and only, He's the Holy One of Israel who has extended His salvation to you out of purest grace. He had to put Peter into a trance before that poor orthodox man would even come into a Gentile house. The Gentiles were unclean. The Goyim, the nations, they eat dead things. Their worship is sex with temple prostitutes. Their greatest philosophers like Plato had his own little boy for his homosexual enjoyment. And nobody in Athens looked up the standard operating procedure for Gentiles who are without God. You see why if you're ignorant of this mystery it condemns you to a conceit as if salvation had always been yours where the church, those poor dumb Jews blew it as if this is a Christian thing always enjoyed by you. It's an institution you've lost the mystery and reduced the faith to a common place because you have not recognized that you have been granted to their faith, to their covenants, to listen to their promises into the commonwealth of Israel itself.

He saved you from being nearly Gentile.

He's brought you into an Hebraic faith in the knowledge of their God and the hope of their destiny. And you think going to church is a drudge and we have reduced it to something predictable in exact proportion to the mystery, the revelation of the mystery. It makes the church a common place.

It's programs predictable. A weariness of the flesh.

It has to be alleviated through novelty and exciting music and amplifiers turned up because we lost the mystery that would have distinguished us as the Church of God. The very continuation of Hebraic faith.

Not for our enjoyment, but for them. That's why I had you whistle.

God has just now shown us the reason for our salvation.

For their benefit.

Through their foe, salvation has come to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy.

Ready? Is this what you're saying, Katz?

That there's a purpose for our salvation beyond ourselves greater than ourselves?

That this is the mystery?

Even Israel itself who were broken out of their own root because of their unbelief and that you're waiting for us to bring them back to their own faith with a demonstration that will issue from us as to move them to jealousy when they see that we as Gentiles are producing fruit and enjoying God in such a Hebraic way and that we ourselves exhibit consistently and continually?

Yes! Exactly!

That is salvation!

How are you doing? Are you moving Jews to jealousy? Or you haven't even impressed them? They walk by your churches in your arms. Gentile culture. Sunday stuff. Where does Paul give us an explanation? I'm looking desperately for an asterisk. How to do it. Step one, step two, step three.

Salvation itself is a formula. Number one, God has a plan for your life. God is waiting for the fullness of the Gentiles to come in.

Will you stop acting like Gentiles? Will you stop reducing the faithful methodology to a technique, a system? It's organic. It's living. It pulsates.

It issues from the life of God.

It's a mystery. That's Hebraic.

God is waiting for the fullness of the Gentiles to come in.

Let this sink in.

There is a purpose for our salvation as Gentiles. It's not some mindless gift that God has given us without redounding to himself and the fulfillment of a mystery. That you Gentiles who have been the object of Jewish scorn and disdain and contempt in our superiority religiously and morally and ethically and culturally Do you think I'm kidding? Look at the winners of the Nobel Prizes. Always Jews out of proportion to their numbers in the population. A distinguished and accomplished people. A distinguished and accomplished people. A distinguished and accomplished people contemptuous of Gentiles.

You know what my mother used to say to me in Brooklyn? We were poor.

Yes, there are poor Jews. So if I got a few dollars and I dug a car out of a blizzard and the man put ten centavos in my palm it would burn a hole in my hand.

Ten cents!

And if I spent it recklessly, if I didn't save it you have a Goyeshekov a Gentile mind.

You're just like them. They get it, they spend it.

Jesus saves, but Moses invests. We can laugh over this but we need to also remember what Jews have suffered historically at the hands of Gentiles who identified themselves as being Christian. The knights of the middle ages, the crusaders. How did they finance their expeditions to the Holy Land? By looting, robbing and pillaging every Jewish community on the way. And when they got to Jerusalem they got all the Jews that were then there into the synagogue locked them in and burned them up. There's a saying in Hebrew Kedushat Hashem sanctifying the name of God. That's what it's called when you commit suicide after having slit the throats of your own children and your own wife before the Gentiles break down the doors of the synagogue and come in and rape your daughters and your wife and compel them to convert to Christianity better than that let us choose death. That when those doors are broken down none of us will have to convert to Christianity. Kedushat Hashem, sanctifying the name of God. I never saw this myself of course I know of it historically but it was in the air that I breathed as a Jew I took this up with my mother's milk enmity against the Goyim that's what a Christian is and God says knowing all of this history in the last days in which if you don't succeed the nation shall not be restored and my kingdom shall not be established and the nations will continue in their presence everything depends the Lord is contained in the heavens self contained waiting for the restoration of all things spoken by the prophets since the world began Ezekiel, Amos the minor prophets, the major prophets Israel's restoration at the end of the age God's waiting for you to move them to jealousy so that they would choose to receive the faith which all previous generations have historically rejected choosing to kill their own children then they should be converted to Christianity but from you must come some demonstration sufficient to take these critics in all of their severe intellectual indictments Jews who are rational Jews who are rationalists who despise things that are supernatural so offensive to their rational understanding they are empirical they need to feel, touch and measure and you're going to tell them that you need their Christ?

they need your Christ?

that criminal who was crucified outside the city in the dump between criminals that that's our Messiah even very God on a cross the shame that contradicts the dignity of God if there is a God and I'm going to believe that is valid now to purge my sins because I think I'm such a great guy your message is zero for me it's foolishness to bring the Gospel to the Jew is the most difficult task given the Church they are historically and chronically opposed it is anathema they cannot mention the name of Jesus I was saved 35 years ago in Jerusalem in the first prayer that I had ever prayed in 35 years after the Lord had given me revelation of himself and I was a university graduate and an articulate man and I could not pronounce the name of Jesus and there's no other name given under heaven or in the earth whereby a man can be saved for whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I couldn't it was stuck in my throat all those years I used it as a curse word Jesus Christ this and Jesus Christ that and now I'm going to call on that name and the name in which my Jewish people have been persecuted I couldn't do it except for the grace in a single moment of time on May 26, 1964 I choked and splurged I would not dignify it to call it a prayer but I got the name of Jesus and I was saved something went out of me the spirit of holiness I was born again from above in the fulfillment of the word over and against all historic and cultural by the grace of God because I was being prayed for one of my own students in California and got saved you know what a mandate is? Romans 11, 11 and I want to say to you quite clearly and I can't blame them it's tough, it's hot, it's demanding, fearful forfeits being a church Paul says in the very first chapter of Romans I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ the power of God and for salvation to the Jew first and also to the Greek God is expressing something here a priority and there's a wisdom and a reason for it to the Jew first then to the Gentiles to the South Sea Islands or other exotic places of ministry begin where you are right in Guatemala City in Mexico City where Jews are in every city where the church is Jews have been proliferated in the judgment of God that has scattered them but also positioned them that you could have opportunity to fulfill the mandate to the Jew first because you've got to know the power of the gospel Paul was not ashamed of it because it itself is the power of God to the Jew first so gather up your faith and knock on the door and the door opens and there is the picture of the world's the supremacy of the world human wisdom ethical and moral quality and you're going to tell him that he needs to be saved you have never felt more foolish your message has never felt more absurd you cry out for something more sophisticated but you have nothing other than this the birth, the death, the resurrection, the ascension of a man who is at the right hand of the Father when Stephen made that statement to religious Jews they rushed upon him they put their fingers in their ears they couldn't bear to hear it a rejected criminal should be in heaven are you getting the picture? ours is no easy task and God says they're first don't try it out where it's easy and gain a little human religious confidence and then go to them .

then you can go to Samaria I never understood the strategy of God until I became a high school teacher with mixed racial classes in a tough cosmopolitan school teaching a compulsory subject that students didn't want to take especially the black ones and the tough ones who hated whitey and the establishment I realized there was an issue from the first day who has the authority here? the timid teacher who is afraid to say the wrong word to aggravate the brutes in the back of the room the place becomes mayhem those nice middle class kids who just need a little mild rebuke and ignore the bully in the back you know what I realized? that if that were my strategy I had to deal with the bullies first the issue of the bully is the issue of authority there's no more formidable opponent to the gospel than the Jew intellectual sharp, informed but biblically illiterate and God wants you to confront him you wonder if your Spanish is good enough is it grammatical enough?

is it eloquent enough? can I meet their arguments?

you never felt more naked weak spiritually barren he wants to show you who your confidence is in the face of the most severe opposition I was saved by a face like yours a little gentile girl on vacation in Europe with whom I should have had nothing to do arrogant intellectual hotshot university graduate, teacher Marxist institutes so transparent so guileless so unafraid she wanted to walk with me in the woods surrounding the European city a gentile girl and so I said, why are you doing this?

why are you being kind to me?

I thought to myself, I'm an ex-Marxist embracing revolution to a total stranger of whom she should have been afraid how do you want to spend this time with me? answered every question the same way it's the love of God there's one thing that an atheist can't bear to hear God talk what a cheap expression I'm tired of cliches whether they are Marxist or Christian I'm afraid I'm going to let her have it again she said the love of God my patience is at an end but I can't stand this God talk let me ask you one question that no Christian has ever successfully been able to answer you know what my hobby was? find Christians and debate with them and wipe them out you want to talk about God?

how do you know that he is?

she'll think of something clever she learned in Sunday school in Bible school and I'll smash her no hesitation full of the light of God I know that God is he lives in me that's where I learned to whistle I went down I was like a struck ox I hit the deck spiritually speaking the power of that statement where did that statement get its power wasn't theological now I understand it was true and she had the face to prove it I was set on the path to God by the face of a Gentile in whom shone the light of the glory of God the light that lightens the Gentiles is the glory of the people of Israel and no demonstration more powerful than when it shines out of a Gentile face have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid you should think that they're temporarily on the shelf so that the salvation that has come to you that is more than just a creedal statement and a sum of correct doctrines the full salvation that transcends your culture and has visibly Hebraicized you will move them to jealousy that they might believe I've been in universities, libraries, institutes but for the first time I realized that I am a man in darkness and that this girl is in the light and the light that she has is not to be found in universities and I'm jealous for that light she moved me to jealous How's your corporate face? The challenge that we represent to you as Jews will compel you to be the church not an institution an organic glory a corporate genius the revelation of Him who fills all in all our Christianity is more than our services or the benefit that we receive or the enjoyment that we obtain has the first purpose to move them to jealousy and when you will succeed in that what then are the Greeks or the Guatemalans or the Peruvians or the Colombians or the depths of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God who has been His counselor for of Him and through Him and to Him are all things Brother, this is too much for me I can't do this, I'm frightened hearing about it How can I do it? It's through Him that it might be to Him as glory forever This is your call, this is your mandate that it might be to His glory forever the church that has come of age because of the issue of the Jew and the wisdom of God just to speak it just to set it forth but to fulfill it Hold the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding are for who has known the mind of the Lord who has been His counselor or who gave it to Him first so that it might be rewarded because of Him and through Him and to Him are all things to Him be glory forever Amen Lord, we bow before You we prostrate our souls we didn't understand the mystery of the church the glory of our call our privilege, our enablement that this is through You not only in our generation but forever Lord, seal this word we have received Your mandate willfully and consciously in Your wisdom we receive the mandate and thank You for the privilege of it in every locality where we are let Your glory be revealed for our privilege in it in Jesus' holy name do it, we receive our mandate and we might do it I think somewhere it says think on these things let this word richly dwell in your heart it will break you up in the deeps it will flush out all that is superficial imitative, counterfeit religious this word, the mystery the mystery received will do wonders for you that you might do wonders for them
