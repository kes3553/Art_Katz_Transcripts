Paul On Mars Hill - Art Katz

The word that needs to be restored to our understanding and to our affections. It's a word that needs to be restored to our affections and to our understanding. The neglect of this word is endless with ordinary Christianity.

Not paying attention to this word would do us a lot of harm. It's an ultimate word. It's an ultimate word.

It requires an ultimate fulfillment. It requires an ultimate fulfillment.

I don't think that it has been seen on the earth in modern times. The earth has not been seen in modern times.

And yet the age will not end without it.

However, the age will not end until it ends.

It is the apostolic faith. It's called the apostolic faith. It results in apostolic glory. It results in gloria apostolica. That exhibits apostolic power.

Se muestra color apostolica.

To men who are in apostolic power.

Trondos andando en car√°cter apostolica. It is our call. Es nuestro canal. And we have been falling into despair. Y no hemos llegado a este canal. Beautiful picture.

The apostle Paul himself in Acts chapter 17.

We all know what happened there.

Paul was in flight from persecution.

And he was sent here by his brethren.

Paul was fleeing persecution from his brethren.

In the city of Athens. He was waiting for his brethren as he was leaving the city. He was waiting here in the city of Athens. He was waiting here in the city of Athens. He was waiting here in the city of Athens. You have to understand the reason why the chapter is so beautiful. It is unrehearsed and unprecedented. He did not prepare himself. He did not prepare himself. He found himself in a city that he did not expect. While he was waiting, he seemed to have set in motion. While he was waiting, all those things were happening. That touched the issue of eternity. What will we exhibit when something comes upon us unaware? What will we demonstrate in an unprepared moment? Is really going to be the issue of the Church of the Last Days. Things will come upon us with utter surprise. A great suddenness that we could not have expected. How we act in that moment. What we exhibit in that moment.

Is what in fact we are.

Everything till that moment is prepared.

It all began with the spirit of God. He started in the spirit of the apocalypse.

He was grieved in the man when he saw the whole city given over to him. Has that been our reaction in this happen? Has that been our reaction in this happen? Is there a city more idolatrous than New York? More full of false idols. False values. The world is going insane. Football players and baseball players making 7 million dollars a year a season.

It destroys all values. It destroys all values of what is important.

Nobody notices what is happening. The way the world is. Paul would never have accepted that. The way the world is. The way the world is. Paul would never have accepted that.

It's a world living in a lie. Its values stink and are corrupt. Its values stink and are corrupt. Millions are sucked up into these idols. Millions of people are contained in these idols.

Success, fame, glory, success.

But the end thereof is eternal. Therefore he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews.

17th century. Do you understand the logic of that? How do you go from being tamed over idolatry to disputing with Jews in the synagogue? What has the one thing to do with the other? Everything. Why can't you see it?

The synagogue is an idolatry. Whether it's Jewish or Gentile.

Whatever the name over the building.

If it doesn't require an ultimate devotion to the Lord, it's an idolatry. If it doesn't require an ultimate devotion to the Lord, it's an idolatry.

It's a self-serving religious business. To accommodate the emotional and spiritual needs of men.

Without requiring their total submission to the Lord.

That's idolatry. It's in the synagogues everywhere.

And in the churches.

Why haven't you grieved?

All the more when it's performed in Jesus' own name. He disputed in the synagogues with the Jews.

With the devout persons in the marketplace. And they brought him up to myself. To hear what this babbler would say. Where the philosophers met every day. Thinking to come to the knowledge of the truth, but never succeeding. You know this word. Mere actors. Making a profession of being lovers of the truth. But never coming to the knowledge of the truth. A posture opposed an act. I don't see it this way brother.

But God does.

You know what apostolic means?

To see as God sees.

And to act out of that seeing. No matter what the consequence is to yourself. Paul was brought up to Mars Hill, the ultimate place of confrontation. With the most powerful and the most prestigious thinkers of his age. A simple Hebrew apostle. He wasn't wearing silk garments. Nor fashionable earrings. His hair wasn't in the latest detail. The fact of the matter is he wasn't even a man of that generation. Or of that culture. Or of that style. He was beyond those things.

He was an eternal man.

Above the values of every generation.

The citizen of heaven.

Wouldn't he be intimidated? All those great Greek buildings. All these temples to the Greek Gods. All these aristocratic philosophers with their great learnings. And he was a contentable people. A man beyond time and generation.

An eternal man. A heavenly man. An apostolic man.

We are moving towards such a confrontation. Not so much in terms of a single Paul.

But a church that has come to an apostolic character.

Beyond time, beyond culture, beyond fashion, beyond style.

They communicate something that's eternal.

Because that's where their leadership is.

Everyone who heard Paul that day will stand accountable for God before God eternally.

They may have thought he was a joke. A Hebrew creature. We can afford to hear f***ing novelty. Let's hear what this babbler says. They'll pay for that hearing forever.

To hear Paul once is to be eternally accountable.

Is that true for your speaking? You may have to take the earing out of your ear. Or whatever it is that roots you in this generation. What you have in your life. What you have in your life. This is an important word. It is calculated to bring you out of a cultural Christianity.

A Pentecostalism with a Latin accent.

Something higher.

Is God's intention for you.

Something much more ultimate. Much more sacrificial. Much more eternal in its consequence. And Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said As I walked by I saw your monuments and it said an inscription to the unknown God.

He whom you ignorantly worship I declare unto you.

I see in all things you're too superstitious. I see in all things you're too superstitious. What he's saying is you're a bunch of phonies.

You profess to be concerned for truth. But you like the unknown God to remain unknown.

It gives you a certain air of spirituality. It gives you a certain air of spirituality. But I'm not going to let you get away with it anymore.

Him whom you ignorantly worship I declare unto you.

That's boldness.

That's apostolic authority. That's apostolic absoluteness.

That's uncompromising.

It's disrespectful of every other view.

But one view. The view that saves for eternity. He said you guys talk about what the purpose of life is? You're philosophers? I'll tell you what it is. I'll tell you in one statement. One thing.

God has made of one blood all nations of men.

One blood. And he's established the bounds of their habitation. For one purpose only. That they might seek after God if they might be fond of Him. That they might seek after me and find me. Speak your heart out. Speak your heart out.

This is the purpose of human existence. That's why God has given nations of political systems and economies.

Not that they should become idols in themselves. Not that they should become idols in themselves.

They're given only as a secondary thing.

To sustain the physical life. That the purpose for that life may be fulfilled. That men might find God. That's a narrow view. That's a narrow view.

But it happens to be God's.

Can you express that as boldly as Paul?

And will those who hear you be convicted by your statement?

Will they believe you? Can you persuade them? Are you living as if you believe that that is the single purpose for human existence? That's the bottom line. Is there a lifestyle that is consistent with what we say we believe? That even those who don't know how we live behind our shut doors and our shades and curtains that even those who don't know how we live inside our houses the truth of it is conveyed by our faces and by our voices. Paul says you can continue playing your games if you want.

But God is commanding all men everywhere now to repent.

He's winked in times past but he's not winking now.

He's commanding all men everywhere to repent.

I wonder if they were laughing under their breath at that point. Who does this guy think he is? What is he trying to suggest? I'm a philosopher. I'm occupied with noble pursuits.

For what shall I repent?

But there's something about Paul that cannot be laughed away.

He said God has commanded a day to judge all men.

By that man whom he has raised from the dead.

Paul speaks about resurrection as easily as breathing.

His voice didn't change. He didn't start now sounding religious. The same consistent man with the same voice and the same truth.

Resurrection and judgment is not a religious category. It's the foundational truth of all life.

We're moving toward an end. A climax in history.

And there's a God coming who will judge. Those who have blasphemed him.

Those who have ignored and rejected him. Those who have played their religious and philosophical games.

He will judge all men.

Is there anything more foolish than Paul in confrontation with the philosophers? Is there anything weaker this pathetic biblical view spoken to men who are philosophers? The glory that was Greece and Paul is not intimidated by them. For he has seen a greater glory than Athens. He's seen the city of God whose builder and maker is God for God has reserved a city for them who confess that they are pilgrims and strangers and sojourners in this world.

Two realities in conflict.

Which is the true one? That which the world applauds and honors or the single weak voice of a foolish Hebrew messenger? Would you be willing to share his reproach? Are you stupid? Are you trying to say that the whole purpose of life is to find God? What do you mean the world is going to come to an end?

That God is going to judge all men?

The world is getting better and better. Clinton has just been elected. And we're going to improve. Why do you speak this doomsday message as if there's an end that's foolishness or it's the truth of God? So they said, well, we'll hear this babbler again. And they never did. Some walked away with disgust. But a few cleaved unto Paul and believed. For the man was his message. I've had only one experience like this. When someone cleaved unto me and believed. A Jewish woman, a professor. A Jewish woman doing yoga exercises. Talk about idols. And throwing her back out. Seven excruciating years of unspeakable pain. And no doctor has been able to help her. My Christian friend brings her to me. And my first word to her was this. What must your Jewish pride have been that God required this to reduce you to seeing me? What must your Jewish pride have been that God required this to reduce you to seeing me? I didn't think I had any Jewish pride.

But she was beginning to hear things as God sees them. And that alone is truth. And that alone will save. Will you speak the word that God puts in your mouth?

Even if it offends your hearer? Insults them? Alienates them from you? Don't you want to be liked? Don't you need to be liked? To be approved by men?

You are not apostolic. You need to be approved by God.

And that's all. I invited this Jewish woman to come to me that night. She said, I can't sit, Mr. Cash. She said, I've got such a terrible back condition, 15 minutes to maximum I can sit. I said, let me pray for you that you can sit. So she came, I prayed for her, she sat in the front row. And what a terrible meeting it was. What a terrible meeting it was. The worst kind of meeting you would ever invite a Jew. When we all get to heaven, what a wonderful day that will be.

Everything calculated to offend Jewish sensibility.

I wish that the floor would open and swallow me. I felt uncomfortable in that environment and I'm a believer. It was time for me to speak. And I didn't have any message. Hot and feverish like I am right now. Out of it physically. My mind was very unclear. I could only trust God and open my mouth. And speak out of the wealth of God's feeling and what he has positioned and formed in me through the crucible of faith over the years. The meeting was over. There was another meeting an hour or two later. And we're sitting in the hallway on the steps of the school building. She said, I'm a Jewish woman. I can't believe in virgin birth. I'm a professor, I'm an intellectual. I can't believe in resurrection from the dead. But she took my hand. She said, but if you can believe, I believe too. And she cleaved unto me and believed. And wouldn't let me leave that night until I had baptized her. That woman is fighting a rare disease today. She got it in the Philippines in Manila. Working on the garbage dump with the lowest dregs of Filipino society.

A Jewish believer giving herself for Christ's sake.

Because she could cleave unto me and believe. Because she could cleave unto me and believe. The man is his message. Dear children, we're coming to an hour when correct doctrine is not enough.

The false church will agree to the truth of the resurrection as a doctrine.

But where are that people that live in its power? Who have no confidence in the flesh. Who are not the reflection of their generation or its culture or its style.

Timeless and eternal men. Foolish in the eyes of the world. But powerful in the sight of God. God is calling you to myself.

Right here in New York. And he's calling you to it together.

Not individual apostolic heroes and heroines. And apostolic people. An apostolic people. With an apostolic mindset. With apostolic seeing. Apostolic obedience. Apostolic authority. Apostolic boldness.

For any man who goes up to such a hill as Paul ascended. Need not think that he's going to automatically come down. Are you willing for such a final confrontation?

That is the purpose of our faith.

And are your services and your activities moving you from face to face? Or fixing you at some level of superficiality and immaturity?

Desire the ultimate thing in God. That the word of God in our mouth is true. That knowing the terror of God, we know the truth. Knowing the terror of God that we can persuade men.

These are the last days.

And we are living in them as if we really believe that. It's a way of suffering.

And a way of glory. It's not for the ordinary religionist.

But those who reveal the glory of God in their generation. Those who meet, see, and hear them will be without excuse before God.

Are you willing to be enrolled in that school? Fitted for that preparation. Together.

This is more than Pentecostalism with a Latin flavor.

I want to pray for that for you. I bewildered some of my Jewish brothers yesterday in Brooklyn. With my Jewish brothers. They said, are you Jewish? I said, what do you think? You have a strange look on your face. You look like those brainwashed ones. You know what he really meant? You have eternity in your face.

You are on the other side. You see beyond this age. You are seeing into the ages.

It's not a Jewishness I understand. But it convicts me. We have a call, children. A call. Beyond any ability in ourselves.

But he is sufficient.

How do you know that, Art? There wasn't five cents worth of me sitting there twenty minutes ago. There wasn't five cents worth. I had to pick up with a blotter. There was nothing left of me. Tired, hot, feverish. Sick. But that's not what you heard. You heard strength. Conviction. Authority.

Very God Himself.

You heard God Himself.

Because what is brilliant about an apostle is to hear Christ resurrected. For me, living is Christ. For me, speaking is Christ. For me, witnessing on Mars Hill is Christ.

None of this self-conscious religious stuff.

It's beyond self-consciousness. It's beyond self. Christ in us. The hope of glory.

Let's pray. Hallelujah. Lord, I bless these children.

I take authority over the power of culture. Over the power of idols. The power of materialism. The power of success. The power of sensuality. I loose them in Jesus' name.

In every false idol of this world.

I loose them for God.

The things that are timeless. Eternal. Recruit from these children today.

Apostles, men and women.

Whose life is no longer their own.

They don't care if people reject them. They don't need the approval of men. They have the approval of God. They have the boldness of God. They have the courage of God. They have the wisdom of God. They have the love of God. Christ is all in all.

And they have emptied themselves of every less of them. Out with the earrings. Out with the hairstyles. Out with the fancy clothing.

Everything in which we sought to find a basis for pride. The acceptance of men.

Out! Beyond time, beyond culture, beyond style.

The eternal and apostolic people of God.

For Jesus' sake.

In His name we pray.

The earring that I have mentioned is symbolic.

But the thing to which it points is not.

Does the world have a hook in you? Its values? Its false values? Yeah. Does it compromise your testimony?

Keep you from an absoluteness in God.

Pull it out and throw it away. It's not worth it.

God's call is to separation.

Unto Him. Have you completed that call? I invite you to do it. To stand up here and come out.

And want to live apostolicly.

And want to be a separated people.

And want to know the authority of God. And the power of God.

When they turn their back on every other thing.

The spirit of the world.

In all of its compromise. Lord we're willing to strip ourselves. To the bone.

We are what we are in you. We are what we are in you. You make us and form us. You give us your perceptions.

Your views. Your reality. Your truth.

And we can proclaim it without fear.

For the end of the ages ahead.

And we look to our eternal inheritance.

The reward that shall not fade away. For which reason we're willing now to bear everything.

Every reproach of men.

Let them call us babbler. Let them call us stupid. Narrow minded.

Yet will we set forth the uncompromising truth. That not one will stand before you with excuse. For if they have encountered us, they have encountered God.

Lord bless these children. Take everything from them. Lord bless these children. Take everything that they're offering up to you. Their love of fashion, their love of style.

They're willing to simplify their lives. They're willing for apostolic simplicity. For a lifestyle consistent with the faith.

We might know the spirit of power.

For we forsake the spirit of the world.

Put your seal on everyone. Seal everyone. They're laying their lives on the line. You might call them to hills from which they'll not come down. They'll be crushed down. Bloody beaten and dead. Because they were obedient to go up. Without any thought for themselves. Release these children.

These apostolic men and women.

Into this city. Into its Jewish neighborhoods. Jewish homes. Jewish businesses.

Let the simplicity of Christ. The bravery of Christ. The high priest and the apostle of our confession. Be manifest in every such place.

Where they are. Give us a fresh resolution today.

The most holy faith.

Once and for all given the saints. Nothing else. Nothing less. No matter what the cost.

The most holy faith. The apostolic faith.

Once and for all. For Jesus' sake.

Drink up the Spirit of God. Receive the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of wisdom and of power. The Spirit of wisdom and of knowledge. The Spirit of the fear of the Lord.

That you might be His messenger.

In the name of Jesus.

Put a divine seal on this moment.

Record the scene in heaven.

And let the invisible cloud of witnesses that were everywhere around this room this afternoon. Rejoice with this heart.

For we consciously identify with them.

Of whom the world was not worthy.

We share their faith.

And we're willing to suffer their ends.

We share their faith.

And we're willing to suffer their ends. Who are not yet complete. Seal us together with them.

In the most holy faith.

Once and for all.

In Jesus' name.

Amen.
