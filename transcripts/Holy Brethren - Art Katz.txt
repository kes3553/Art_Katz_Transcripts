Holy Brethren - Art Katz

If I'm feeling it physically, I want to pray. Lord, I plead your blood upon our heads, upon this door and upon this house, upon myself in particular, that the enemy who would seek in any way to oppose your communication would be repelled by the blood upon the door and upon our heads and that your word would suffer no loss for we are asking more than instruction. We are asking a word that will constitute an event of a foundational kind, though it comes only to these few souls in this room. It would be a word that endures and affects all the future. So grant grace for that communication out of the jealousy of your own heart for the church of this city and of this nation. Redeem this time as only you can as the High Priest and the Apostle of our confession. And we thank you and give you praise. In Jesus' name.

Amen.

I think I'll just begin from the end of that prayer. You're going to have to turn to this. It's just one verse out of chapter three of Hebrews. Wherefore, holy brethren, chapter three, verse one, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ, is for the want of this consideration that we are suffering. Even the language of this verse sounds to us archaic and remote. Holy brethren, heavenly calling, we would almost be embarrassed by references like that. They are so out of keeping with the present tenor of our modern mentality, even as Christians. So we need to consider. That's why it says that. If we are to be holy brethren, and to recognize that we have a heavenly calling. Because even the word heaven is not in our consciousness. It sounds like an irrelevant reference. But we are asked to consider it. Because our task as holy brethren is to bring heaven into Bulgaria, another mode of reality, a means of being, a whole value system, which is completely in opposition to the world, in every point in particular. That's why those who have subscribed to it, and have sought to make it known, have suffered the severest opposition. Because the powers of the air know whom to fear. They themselves say, Jesus we know and Paul we know. But who are you? There's nothing more important than that they should know us.

And fear us.

Because we represent something that threatens what they are. They are the Gods of this present world. And they jerk and manipulate entire nations. It's like not the least of the things that constitute an apostolic mindset, not the least of the things that make suffering. To which I have devoted an entire chapter in this book. To the principalities and the powers of the air. To which the church knows hardly anything. If we have any awareness at all, usually at the level of personal demon possession and deliverance. We have no awareness of a structure that is an overlay over the entire world.

Influencing every nation.

They are the rulers of this present darkness. And like to conceal themselves. Yet they operate profoundly in society and in the world. We mustn't dismiss them as some kind of vague phantom spirit. Paul says of them in 1 Corinthians, If they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. Paul identifies the root of the destruction of Jesus. Jewish instigation, Roman enablement, crucifixion is the Roman form of execution. But if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. They were able to affect the death of Jesus. Because of their spirit influence in the heavenlies.

To affect men in the earth.

So as to fulfill their will. How else shall we understand Nazism? And the annihilation of 6 million Jews. To the very last day of the war. That has stupefied military historians. The Germans never relented in the machinery of annihilation. To the very last day of the war. They were still seeing the systematic annihilation of Jews. When by every reckoning they should have been employing their material and manpower for their own final defense. This is not to be understood politically, sociologically. This is demonic phenomenon.

Not just influencing the nation. But taking full possession.

And turning the most liberal, cultured civilization in the world. Into an engine of destruction for world Jewry.

And almost the world itself.

Exhibiting the distinctive character of the powers of darkness. As the kind that is visited on Jesus himself. Violence, threat, destruction, devastation, chaos. This is the distinctive nature of the devil.

And the fallen angels with him.

And they are the Gods of this world. The church will never be the church.

In any significant, apostolic sense.

Until it takes this realm of reality into its deepest consideration. And begins to see the world as a system operated by these powers. That the love of the world is enmity with the Father. There is so much more that I could say. In Ephesians chapter 3. Which we will not turn to now. From verse 10. Paul who is the steward of the mysteries of God. Which is the distinct privilege and calling of an apostle. That's why we so desperately need their function.

Because if it doesn't come from them.

They are the guardians of the holiest mysteries of God of the church of Israel. And we have suffered for the want of their impartation. But Paul even says in Ephesians. The apostles and the prophets are the very foundation of the church. Which unto him be glory forever.

A typical apostolic statement.

That the issue for an apostle is not the success of the church. Or the benefits that accrue to its members.

Or blessing.

But it's an instrument for the glory of God forever.

This is Paul's profound jealousy.

That exceeds and eclipses even his love for his own nation Israel.

And even that of the church.

As profound as these two instrumentalities are. As profound as these two things are.

Israel and the church.

They are not to think in themselves. But a means to a greater end. The glory of God forever. This issue of glory is lost to our contemporary church. We may include it in our hymns and songs. But we don't in fact believe it.

Anticipate it. Seek it. Or jealous for it.

So if you want to become an apostolic entity.

Which is God's jealousy for you.

You must have at the very foundation of your being.

Your corporate life. A jealousy for the glory of God. Forever.

Only that will enable you to be the fools for Christ's sake. That apostolic reality requires.

And when you come to this alone. When you come to this consciousness. In a willful choice. The purpose for our being.

Is God's glory.

In our time. And in our location.

Whatever it takes. And the remarkable thing is this. That the church that you would think is the means to that end. Is in its present configuration the greatest opponent. And will be the greatest cause of opposition to you. Because the principalities and the powers of the air.

Occupy institutions. In society. Government. Culture. Education. Religion.

And when our faith has lost its apostolic character. And has become in effect an institution.

Those powers are present.

To exert their influence. And to play upon men for ambition.

For style and role.

And so they will rise up in the greatest opposition. To that which threatens that institution. Which is the issue of apostolic reality. When the powers of the air over this locality. Who recognize that you have come to this kind of concentration. You will experience their opposition.

For the same reason for which they knew Jesus and Paul.

They will now know you.

Because to commit yourself to this.

Is an ultimate and total consecration. That cannot be performed by religious well-meaning intention.

The essential feature or character of an apostle.

Of which Paul is the personification. Of which Paul himself is the personification. Is that his life is not his own. When he says for me to live as Christ. I am crucified and hidden with Christ and God. This is not a religious rhetoric.

A certain biblical ideology.

This is eminently the man of the resurrection. Who has counted all things as done.

That he might win Christ. And know him. That he might serve him.

In the power of the resurrection.

Dear, dear children.

We have to go beyond the mere approval of the truth.

Of the doctrine. And live in that life.

That's what the issue of God's glory will require. And it requires an ultimate consecration. Because it's a heavenly calling. And everything on earth will oppose it. This is ultimate gospel heroism. And it's not the issue of individual, virtual, also saints. It's the church as the church.

The corporate body of Christ.

Which is an organism and not an entity. Which is an organism and not an institution. And as we know about organisms, they are messy and bloody. That's why men prefer institutions. That's why men prefer institutions.

That could be organized and structured. That requires performance.

That the body of Christ as the church is a mystery.

Of an organic kind.

That is connected to the head.

Every joint supplying.

Life is derived from the head, like themselves. And until we come to that formulation.

In truth.

These powers have no obligation to recognize us. We can make the bravest statements about our intentions. But they see right through those professions. They've got to see in us what they saw in Paul. And Paul says in chapter 3 of Ephesians, to come back to that. That God has desired that his wisdom.

His many sided complex wisdom.

Should be demonstrated to the principalities and powers of the air.

Through the church.

And that this is the eternal purpose of God. In Christ Jesus.

What a mouthful.

We need an entire night just to examine this. What is the wisdom of God? And that God thinks it's so important. That he has created everything.

The whole cosmos. And the earth.

And it's the revolutions and it's seasons.

That through the church.

The manifold and complex wisdom of God.

Might not just be acknowledged by the church. Will not just be acknowledged. Will not just be acknowledged. Or spoken about as an interesting subject.

But be demonstrated. Because it can only be demonstrated corporately. Through a quality of life and relationship. That is of a heavenly kind. And it is different from the wisdom of the world.

In all of it's values.

This is our heavenly calling. So you see we need a consciousness.

A mindset. Of an apostolic kind.

Who is the apostle? The word apostolic actually means sent. The root of the Greek word apostolo. And so we see in Acts chapter 13.

The first apostolic act. The Holy Spirit speaking into a particular congregation. Not to Jerusalem but Antioch. Not to a totally Jewish congregation. But to a mixed diverse congregation.

Which we can even identify by the text itself.

One of the believers is called Niger.

Which means black.

He was evidently an African. Some of this were Hebrews. Others were from a Roman descent. Or from Cyprus or from other Mediterranean islands. But when they were found worshiping the Lord together.

This is the exact language of the text. The Holy Ghost said.

So when they had fasted and prayed. They the congregation. Multinational, multiethnic. And sent them forth.

This is the first sending. And it says so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went. That God equates the laying on of the hands of men and women. As being the sending of the Holy Ghost. They were being sent into a world of violence. Of Balkan tensions and conflict.

Because something has been established at Antioch.

Of a transcendent and a heavenly kind. By which men were able to rise above their national, ethnic and racial origins.

They had become holy brethren. With a heavenly calling. But really brethren. Because they were worshiping the Lord together. With more than singing the chorus.

That was beyond what the world and the earth knows. It's another wisdom. Think of the depth of the enmity between Jew and Gentiles.

Black and white. Look at your own history.

With the conflict and ethnic cleansing. With Bosnia and Serbia. The hatred by people who are of the same ethnic origin. That's God sent these men into that kind of world.

To save them out of it. To save them from death.

And to communicate another wisdom.

Another mode of living. Another reality of a heavenly kind. Which they had a pain in their life in the church at Antioch.

And God does not tell us how it was obtained. But I can suggest to you. Now that we are in our 28th year in community.

Living together on the same property. In daily relationships. Going from house to house daily breaking bread.

That this kind of church is a suffering. Before it's a glory. I could keep you up all night with stories.

Of shocking revelations.

Of the truth of the condition of the most impressive spiritual saints.

Who maintained this spirituality. So long as their Christianity was Sunday services. But when it came to intensive daily relationships with saints. All the frictions. The tension. The conflicts.

About the condition of others.

And of ourselves.

But it's in that kind of context. That the reality of another kingdom is established.

In another form of reality.

That the reality of another kingdom is established. If you are willing for the suffering of it.

And the terrible disillusionment. Disappointment. Even betrayal. With other saints. Disappointment in ourselves.

Brings us into a depth of reality. By which heavenly things are formed.

That can be sent. That can be sent. Moses was a sent one. A deliverer of his people. An expensive corporation by God. A remarkable picture of a man who thought he was Israel's appointed deliverer. Acting out of his own energy. And understanding. To kill an Egyptian.

And God keeps him in the wilderness. As he has kept us.

For 40 years.

40 is the number of trial. Then the encounter with the God of the burning bush. Who says in verse 10 of chapter 3 of Exodus. Verse 10.

Come now therefore and I will send you. You don't send yourself. I will send you.

Not because of your evaluation of the needs of the people of Israel.

But there the stress and cry has come up to me. And now I will send you. Not out of your initiative but out of mine.

But Moses said who am I that I should go. And this is an apostolic requirement. Paul says who is sufficient for these things.

The remarkable paradox. Ultimate calling.

And ultimate sense of personal inadequacy. This is almost a qualification to be sent. Moses says in verse 10 who am I that I should go. Pharaoh is the symbol of the devil. Pharaoh is the symbol of the devil.

The palace of darkness.

This is not ascending to some peripheral need. This is at the heart of the enemy's territory. And God's answer is certainly I will be with you. And that's his answer to us also. The Paul who says who is sufficient for these things. Christ is my sufficiency.

I can do all things through him.

Through him I move and live and have my being. So I'm giving you a sketch. A very inadequate, very shallow, of some of the essential elements that constitute ascending. For Paul is father for ourselves. And what is the result of that ascending? It says in the book of Acts, these are they that turn the world upside down. For apostolic seeing sees the world as being totally corrupt. Its values are patently false. Its reality is a pseudo reality, false reality.

Its church is an entertainment.

Its people are victims of merchandise spitting out their lives without any awareness of eternity. That the world lives in the father of lives. The whole world is set in the father of lives and needs to be turned upside down. Not only through what we in fact are radically separated from that world and not living by its standards or its values preferring even apostolic poverty and being considered the least of men and the lost power of the world and without reputation because reputation and recognition and the seed is the wisdom of this world that manipulates and jerks and the end of that way is death. So in the Philippines at a minister's conference I said to my brown skinned brothers all of whom have come out of poverty very real poverty and now we're enjoying a certain dignity as ministers that can put food on the table and have a decent suit of clothing and a career of vocation. The esteem and favor of men, recognition and promotion in a religious system or to be known and to be feared by the powers of darkness. You can't have it both ways. Who of you will stand before God that you should be recognized by the powers of darkness and feared? What it will mean is that you have to forsake any concern to be recognized and to be promoted I'm not doing this moment justice I'm not describing this as I thought There was a tension in the air you could cut with a knife There was a moment of truth that men were free to make for or against who didn't want to go back to poverty who would have to face that risk if they forfeited the values of this world if they gave up and chose to be feared by the powers of darkness and some of them stood up with trembling and something was happening overhead in the air and in heaven that would be significant for all that nation That's the issue of the cross Maybe just to take a few minutes in First Thessalonians and catch a little sketch of Paul who himself is such a separated man and that's why he could come to pagans and set them free not just a religious option but an exchange of kingdoms because he says in chapter 1 of verse 5 our gospel came unto you not in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost chapter 1 verse 5 because you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake think on this the gospel came to them in the power of the holy spirit to set them free from idols and to serve the living God and save them from the day of his wrath I'm actually quoting the text here who even thinks like that today what modern Christian is thinking about the day of wrath from which he has been saved Paul communicated this to pagans who had no biblical foundation in so powerful a way that the issue of the Lord's coming and of judgment in the world was made cogent and real that is apostolic preaching that takes apostolic power that's communicating another reality totally invisible and yet made real to the hearers in such a way as to embrace a message that will make them an object of opposition from their own kinsmen for they are not continuing in those traditions and have adopted the God of the Hebrews the God of Jacob and the God of Israel and will live differently and the very living will be an indictment on those who remain pagan this is a radical turning and was accomplished by the hearing of a message preached in a particular apostolic power and authority because Paul says you know what manner of men we were among you which is to say that the issue of true preaching and anointing charisma is also the issue of character you know what manner of men we were among you Paul could say that boldly for your sake not for my sake for any benefit that I would receive Paul himself was another kind of man he was not only the speaker of the message he was the message and in the apostolic church an apostolic body is the thing in itself he represents the one who sent him that's why Jesus could say if they receive you they receive me and if they receive me they receive him who sent me they receive in the ultimate reality of God because the sent one is the representative of that God and lives by his life he serves his purposes you know what manner of men I was and that's why the gospel came to you in power that you should turn from idols to serve the living God and to wait for his son from heaven and to wait for his son who will be raised from the dead even Jesus who delivered us from the wrath to come Paul is profoundly eschatological the wrath to come and worthy in the day of the Lord's appearing many references to the end of the age the coming of the Lord the conclusion of history and time this is eschatological the Lord's coming this consciousness is entirely lost to the church today it has no anticipation of the end that's why one Sunday is like another moving consciously toward a conclusion of a cosmic kind that glorifies God forever by which the crucified and the despised one returns as king of glory to rule from the appointed place of God the holy hill of Zion where God says I have to set my son on the holy hill of Zion and given him the nations for his inheritance how much can you take you need to understand apostolatry the whole foundational issue of the faith is the rule of God over his own creation an actual kingdom come whose king is a descendant of David and can rule from the throne of David and rule forever and affect all nations it's the end of the influence and the power of darkness the false rules of this world's darkness are completely ended and mankind is freed when the king takes his throne on the holy hill of Zion that's the reality which has to do with the restoration of the nation of Israel more than what is represented by today's political state which was at the heart of Paul's understanding for which reason he gives three chapters three chapters of the subject in Romans and tells the church they should not be ignorant of this mystery what is an apostolic body one that anticipates this end and this climax and conclusion knows that it will be bitterly opposed in seeking it and desires it sees everything as pointing toward that end understands the issue of Israel in that climax and is willing to be extended as a sacrifice and is willing to be extended as a sacrifice for Israel's restoration my subject tomorrow and that this is part of an entire understanding a mindset of an apostolic view that cannot be obtained by single individuals that requires an organic knit of life who consecrate themselves to these ultimate things and that when it takes place not only does heaven recognize it but the powers of darkness also Jesus they know and Paul they know but who are you? so you know what my prayer for you is which is more than the enjoyment of your present fellowship it's nice to enjoy what you have and a shared camaraderie a shared fellowship, an enjoyment of worship and choruses and sharing of the word that does not threaten the powers of darkness but when you come to a willful choice and consecration but when you come to a willful choice and consecration to see this apostolic reality established in that which is authentic and which is the meaning of the word apostolic authenticity that's what they recognize when you're willing to consecrate yourself to that whatever it takes what you have gotten from your schools your education the wisdom of the school from which there needs to be a really radical recognition and separation that you would not only acknowledge another set of values the wisdom of God that demonstrated even by your very presence the powers of the air will know it and your neighbors will know it this kind of presence cannot be ignored to serve the living God by turning from the idols the message that will issue from you is attended by the authority and the power of God is attended by the authority and the power of God for he himself is the high priest and the apostle of us he will be with us in a world that is hostile and opposed to this reality and nowhere more powerfully opposed than in the realm of religion than in the realm of religion it is they that will kill us and claim they're doing God's service I want to pray for you Lord I feel your jealousy for these children I understand better than they what this evening represents for them it's a curiosity a Jewish man passing through a form of understanding but for you it's holy it's divine dissertation it's an ultimate call to an ultimate reality that the church is not known in this city and in this nation and much so before the end comes so I pray for these children a grace to understand and a willingness to sacrifice and that the church itself a church in command that they might be a radically separated people and show forth another wisdom not only what they say we know that this will not be easy or cheap it will be painful it's the cross and they will bring upon their heads opposition that they would not have needed to experience I am satisfied with something at the periphery of the church on the outside looking in enjoying their own fellowship but not terrifying the powers of the air let tonight's sharing not just be a message but a call and may you receive their yay and amen even as you did that day from those Filipino pastors they chose to be feared by the powers of darkness rather than to win the esteem of men and the powers of darkness trembled at their decision something was struck in the air overhead and something was released in the heaven that will have consequences they will be another kind of man for the sake of others who wasn't even aware that they were pastors until they see the heavenly freedom that these children exhibit it's a reality an ultimate reality another kingdom whose time has come and let not your words fall to the ground they will have occasion to consider and review it and even now on the basis of this brief sharing they know what is being asked of them and are able to give you a yes even now that releases you
