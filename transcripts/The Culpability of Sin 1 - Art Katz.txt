The Culpability of Sin 1 - Art Katz

So we bless you Lord, we don't know whether to review what has been spoken or just to break into this whole subject area but you know and we look to you who has been so exceedingly faithful because you can't help yourself with what you are in yourself and we pray that we might be that way also because we can't help ourselves with what we are in God. So Lord bless us together precious God and we just bow before you with such gratitude for the privilege to consider things that are so rarely examined and ask for a grace Lord in it, a grace to consider the things that are in your heart as you see them and that as men must be brought to see them or suffer the consequence of the ignorance which is willful. Bless us and sober us and bring us more to the status of sons and daughters by considering the Father's heart. We thank you and give you the praise. With this privileged time, in Jesus name, Amen.

Amen. Amen.

Well, anybody feel about reviewing material of the last time? About the subject of judgment and maybe one thing that is not to be missed, the issue of the triune God which is to say the issue of God, it's knowing God as God as he in fact is and not to know him as he is and as he has desire to be known is not to know him and not to know him as a calamity. We're not talking about an idle knowledge, we're talking about the substitution for God in the name of God even by those who purport to believe only to find in the day of calamity that there's no God who answers. That might well be the explanation for the tragic silence in the Holocaust that those who thought themselves to be calling upon God were calling more upon the God of their own projection than the God in fact who is God. It's costly to reject the revelation of God as he himself presents himself and to insist on some other view that is more compatible with our self-interest. I'm not clever enough, maybe you can help, why men would prefer the inadequate view of God, why they would insist on a monotheistic view and not only insist but see themselves as the heroic defenders of the faith when that is not God, it never was God and we have now after the revelation at the cross of the triune God, the son at the cross crying to the Father in heaven and suffering unto death by the eternal spirit to continue to insist upon an erroneous view after that costly revelation has got to bring consequence, it's got to bring judgment and we're suffering that judgment still. It may well be that not the least of the reasons why Israel still has the day of Jacob's trouble before it is that in its own road to Calvary that inexplicable suffering that Jesus himself said eclipses every previous suffering because since the world was there never was before and there never will be again a time of a suffering as yet future that not the least reason is the very resemblance of Jesus's own path to the cross, rejection despised of men suffering outside the city which is to say Jews in the wilderness of the nations rejected repulsed bearing across of which they're not conscious the cross of suffering that in their own experience they would come to recognize that which they have rejected in his experience only by virtue of the revelation that comes by walking it out themselves. I'm only surmising but I wouldn't put it past God that the only way to apprehend that kind of knowledge is the experience of it or the proximity to that experience not that they are like him voluntary and willing servant people to bear a cross in a redemptive way but just the the judgment which he bore they'll bear for their own sin and the resemblance to his suffering his path to Calvary will give them a glimpse of his they'll see the parallel so don't think that we've covered this material that's just a bit of an afterthought but that this issue of God as he himself is and that if we will not realize it in the Word in God's own testimony and references to the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit in the Word it will not recognize it in the demonstration of the Christ at Calvary if we'll not see it in the Word will we see it in the event that the triune God has revealed not only in his Word but in his acts and that if we have rejected the act as we have rejected the Word we have rejected the last opportunity to see God as he in fact is so the view that reconciles the God of mercy with the God of judgment the God in his acts is the revelation of God and his persons it's the revelation of God as he has he himself is is God's provision against error and against deception not only for the Jew but also for the church so that I wrote here that it may God the church itself against the last days deception as well as being a key to the revelation of the triune God for the Jew it may well be that we are candidates for deception as the church because although we give credence to the doctrine of a triune God we're living monotheistically so the fact that we have labeled something Jesus doesn't in fact make him that and that it may well be that if we have that warp in our view and have not a correct view of God and we're susceptible and open for every other warp and every other deception the view of God as God himself is is God's greatest provision and antidote against deception in any area and that's God's cry the knowledge all that they might know me is God's cry and of course what he means is that they might know me as I in fact am and not as they thought me to be because in the scriptures there's several references where God rebukes Israel you thought I was such a one as yourself and we are continually in the process of making God in our image we project upon God our image of the kind of patsy God we would like him to be who serves our purposes we are continually elevating ourselves above God even unconsciously and we began this whole discussion by the statement of Elie Wiesel the great commentator on the Holocaust who when I asked him to what degree he would acknowledge Jewish suffering historically in the Holocaust in particular as being the fulfillment of prophetic scriptures in the book of Deuteronomy books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus his answer was I refuse to consider that so the exaltation of man and his opinion even over against the clear stated word of God is in my opinion enough grounds for the Holocaust itself because it's the nub the problem of man's exaltation over God it invites judgment even after the judgment and when a man says that who was the victim of the judgment and so his entire family wiped out at Auschwitz and he himself is the sole survivor and still claims tenaciously to this exaltation I refuse to consider that it's not whether it's true or not it's whether it's convenient or not because to consider that is to open yourself for a complete devastation in every area of your thought of your view of God of man of purpose of history of life a future of value and of yourself that's why my mother is running scared that's why a 90 year old woman has her ears in her fingers and her hands over her eyes and wants to make it to the finish line without any distraction over the issue of Jesus because that issue is every issue the issue of Jesus is the issue of God the issue of God is the issue of truth and once you open yourself then every category that you have so carefully maintained for 90 years that puts you in a self-justifying light is devastated and who can bear it the only thing that would enable you to bear it in this life is the awareness that if you don't suffer that measure here you'll suffer it eternally and that without remedy it's the eternal shriek here is a shriek but it ends in joy there is a shriek without relief so that's the issue of truth and what can we say but mankind has been so resistant to the truth of God despite all of his entreaties from the time of Jesus and before the testimony of the prophets and the apostles in the history of the church that in the last analysis coming to the end of the age and the issue of the day of eternity before us that God has no recourse but to bring the most devastating preliminary judgments into the experience of men in the hope yet that they will serve the redemptive purpose of saving them from the ultimate judgments which are without remedy that's why I could say at a minister's conference in Japan if you think that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were only military decisions of an expedient kind and not understand that it was God bringing raining fire and death on Japan to save you from an ultimate fire and that without remedy then you then you don't understand and a man shot up out of his seat and cried out God he said make me a prophet for my nation in other words enable me to explain to my nation the meaning of its own disasters to save them from the future disaster that is eternal and without remedy and that's why the whole issue of the holocaust and judgments of God must be set in the context of eternity if you remove eternity if you try to consider the holocaust only in temporal terms there's no way to fathom it it only makes sense in the in the light of eternal judgment so these are pen pen ultimate judgments preliminary judgments in the light of one that is final irremediable and eternal without recall but we don't understand it and the fact of the matter is that we don't understand it the church has not this sense of eternity and eternal judgment which is one of the four or five basic doctrines that Paul speaks about in hebrew six before you can go on to the to the deep things of the word these are the this is the the milk of the word the laying on of hands the eternal judgment salvation but it has escaped the church we have not had a stomach for it so divine judgment becomes a hermeneutical key for the revealing of the mystery of the Godhead Godhead himself hermeneutical means principle of interpretation of the scripture of God and of God himself so to reject that revelation condemns jews to a view of God which is not God and therefore and therefore one who could not save out of calamity i can't think of anything more horrendous than to think that you know God and in a day when you want need to call upon God desperately to find out that you're just talking to the air you're calling to a projection of your own making it's the last cruel idol of your own deception better to be safe from that before the day of calamity so the greatest calamity is that which is eternal and irremediable is it not for this which every lesser calamity rightly interpreted was calculated to save us can you see why it is that when i present a paper like this before even a group of scholars and men who are called to the jews you can't hear this in one i went through what 13 pages i didn't even go through it i just spot read it as the lord led and they grumbled that i took too much time i mean just this little bit here would deserve hours of consideration so Israel's first deliverance was initiated by a man who turned aside to see a burning bush he looked into the issues of judgment which is still burning why does the bush burn and is not consumed because the issues have not yet been met they're unresolved and whether it will be today or some other time somewhere in one of the back pages i talked about the prophetic cry of God to the Israel through its history and i raised the question not when have we responded to the cry when have we even heard it from that perspective what ought to be the foundational basis for our approach to jews now but moses and the prophets of which jews are profoundly ignorant as i read to my mother out of the book of isaiah and she said we're in the new testament is that found and moish moish rosen of jews for Jesus in defending the faith against the charge that the new testament is anti-semitic i don't know if you know that this is a profound complaint the world jury that there'll never be a settlement of the issue of anti-semitism which resulted in the holocaust this is their view except that the root of it the references in the new testament against jews be excised out so that when i was in in the phoenix area and they had a weekly talk in the synagogues by local rabbis this rabbi came and gave a talk on the prophets and after all of the innocuous questions that were asked that were nothing i stood up and i said can you tell me sir when it is that we as a nation have ever acknowledged the controversy the complaint of God the indictment against us through the prophets when have we ever answered it and i forgot what you're in the little dream answer the question is when have we ever heard it because tragically and ironically modern jews are biblical illiterates they couldn't tell you where to find the prophets if they stumbled over it they wouldn't recognize it we have not only read every other book we have written them carl mark sigman freud we are the dispensers the talmud but the word of God we know that and even in the deepest jewish orthodoxy the word of God is only the pretext for rabbinical commentary so when you look at a page of the talmud you may have at the center the verse but then around it is rabbi jonathan's commentary then rabbi akiva's then rabbi so-and-so's it goes out from there and what they really are discussing is not the word but the rabbinical interpretations that take your father and father from it until you're occupied with such profound questions as would the sabbath be violated if you move this from there rather than from there to there and what do you do when you're outside i mean just it's a remarkable thing but the word of God they know that because the attitude to the word of God and the attention to the word of God is the issue of God himself whether it's the jew or the christian our our knowledge of God and our love of God is more safely measured by our knowledge and love of the word not just the consideration of it but the obedience to it so it's not an accident that Jesus is called the word made flesh and as we have rejected the oral word the written word we rejected that word also so if Israel's first deliverance came by a man who turned aside to say by what means will Israel's final deliverance come that is to say everything in the end is corporate there was the singular christ now the body of christ there was a single moses now maybe in the last days a mosaic company of an apostolic kind called commissioned mandated and sent to bring last days jews out of the egypt of the nations and into the land of promise but only on the basis of ascending only on the basis of i will be with you only on the basis of who am i that you should send me total sense of ineptitude and inability and our own failures and yet the one distinguishing thing that was the criterion for his call and ours is he turned aside to see um i don't know if we'll ever have the occasion together but i wrote a paper in the seminary on isaiah about uh comforting my people and the nub of the paper is that the thing that will preserve a remnant of jews in the last days is the word of comfort the word the prophetic word that your God will come and save you in the midst of their disaster and before they there's any possible view of seeing him come to people who are not habituated to that seeing but are able to go on by the power of the word that comes to them prophetically that says your God will come and comfort you and that that word can only be spoken in prophetic integrity in a life-giving way by those who did not withhold themselves from speaking previously the word of necessary judgment though those who not only turned aside to see judgment but could speak the word of judgment and even the future judgment yet to come and so the whole nub of that paper in isaiah was this that jews have one basis for believing the word of comfort that will save them even before that coming because they have come to a place where they have learned to esteem the word of God prophetically as being true which is to say that they receive the word of judgment as true because it was confirmed by their experience and therefore they can hear and receive the word of comfort because to know that the God who spoke judgment and did it is the God who now speaks comfort and will do it that's the so the issue of judgment and the ability to communicate it and to show our suffering people that what they're going to suffer in in the time of jacob's trouble and maybe to speak to them in the midst of that time is the word of God and that God always fulfills what he speaks that's the God that he is and because you're now experiencing that fulfillment you see how important it is to say i refuse to consider that if you refuse to consider that what will you do when you're hanging on the ropes and are about to expire and the prophetic word comes hang in there your God is coming he will deliver you and you're well i can't consider that because i didn't consider this the consideration of the word of judgment is the condition is the condition with the consideration of the word of promise and the one who speaks it is the one who first spoke it as judgment and will now speak it as comfort namely the prophetic church of the last days who does not balk from looking at hard things and even speaking then maybe one of the reasons that i got shut out at las vegas when i presented this paper to men who are in ministry to the jews is they don't want to speak it they would rather speak four spiritual laws notice how four spiritual laws begins by the way there's a fifth one for jews literally this is a bill bright publication of campus crusade it begins with God has a plan for you the beginning is an appeal to the benefit that you will receive there's not a reference so far as i know to judgment and being saved out of it it's positivistic in keeping with the spirit of our contemporary world but where are the people who will come to the jews and speak hard words but speak them with a love that they would recognize as i was confronted at where's the famous girl school that begins with a v in upstate new york vassar college and the the meeting was broken into by a dozen black fedora headed hasidic jews out of brooklyn who came to terrify and succeeded i've never seen christians more terrified when they broke in through those doors and never sat down and stood around the room and everybody stopped breathing and as close to me as these ladies and i'm trying to finish a message on abraham and circumcision try preaching under adverse circumstances while they're glowering at you seeing you as public enemy number one hitler only destroyed our bodies you're seeking to destroy our souls and then when i finished and was open for questions and answers and boom boom all hell literally broke loose they were under an anointing from below yeah and you sure heard the crisis came out of the christians who thought to love jews until their ox was gored until jews came in a way that was not cute but terrifying a hit squad you know how do you react then is where you are yeah that's why God's preparing us because we're going to be hit the doors are going to burst open and they're going to come in and God knows what condition and they don't like this and they don't like that and you're a traitor and they're calling your names and you're extending your life for them but i'll never forget this moment this guy was glowering at me he said if you're how do you say it your messiah you are was here now he said we were due to him with our fathers the 3000 years ago oh my God and then he said and i know that you love us cats and then he went on to say something else but i never followed it i i looked i never told you that how do you know that i don't know it myself how do you know it we know that you love us cats i don't know how they know it we know you have the spirit they said but we don't know that it's God as you know in the regular prophetic school we take that time to examine true and false prophetic ministry because that is the issue of the end not only for the church but for the jew that's why i'm so jealous over the integrity and the truth of that prophetic call which is now being made into hamburger by people who are much more casual about it and the whole popularity of sudden prophets that have come upon the scene and the casual shallow content of their prophetic ministries mostly the gift of prophecy or the gift of knowledge if indeed it's that if it's not clairvoyance we have nothing it has nothing to do with the prophetic call from an oracular question from the word oracle if it's not the prophetic oracles what God is saying what's on God's own heart which i believe this is and with the resonance of God and the authority of God how then is it prophetic so this question of what is prophetic is the great issue of the church and it's the issue of Israel's survival because in ezekiel 37 which is the classic text the paradigm of the end when Israel is finally down and out and we're all going to see that Israel is going to be without hope and bereft of anything they must come to that place because they are the exemplars of human self-sufficiency prowess and ability the only thing that makes jews jews is that they are man everything that is in man is what we jews are but brought to its ultimate expression so when God deals with us he's dealing with man and man's hope in himself and man's confidence in himself so Israel is suffering for the whole of mankind that are attached with it in their hopes in themselves and independent of God i mean even now in the crisis of Israel if anybody pays any attention to the whole thing with arafat the plo and the the remarkable outworking of men who thought to make an azlo agreement that has given their severest enemies who have vowed their destruction the whole principle of the foundation of plo is Israel's destruction they'll not be satisfied with anything else and to negotiate with enemies who have never altered that determination and now not only give them a foothold but a whole place within the nation and of course they have to have a police force and so they arrange for 9 000 it's up to 20 000 and they have more than pistols they've got the most up-to-date armaments that is much more than just keeping the law in the terror in the gaza strip so they've got now within as well as without an armed enemy waiting for the moment in which God will release the most diabolical hatred upon them so Israel is in for an unbelievable in my opinion devastation and that's why in ezekiel 37 which i believe is a future statement in verse 11 it says and they themselves say we are cut off we are without hope we are as dry bones for jews to acknowledge that is an unbelievable admission which even this holocaust did not obtain what came out of this holocaust was not a broken defeated people and said we are cut off we are without hope these dry bones when in literally they were dry bones but to cry never again the proud defiant assertion never again and think of the implications of that which says in profound ways left unspoken that the holocaust was not the dealing of God but the dealings of men which we suffered in our defenselessness that's why they got away with it but now they will never do it again because we're the third greatest military power with number one air force nuclear deterrent shows a complete misconstruction of the meaning of their last tragedy and makes them therefore the candidates for the next but that next will come and that devastation will be yet more severe than the holocaust of world war ii which took six million jews how much will this take only a remnant will survive of the of present world jewelry somewhere like 13 to 15 million people note my question is cats you're going to live through that without going haywire what's going to preserve your sanity if you're shredded by one and frank what are you going to do when you see the tens of thousands of and franks going up in smoke i don't know how we're going to bear their suffering it's going to take a certain i don't know what and maybe that's part of the answer of what the prophetic church of the last days is it has the grit the moral grip and the spiritual stamina to bear hard words and the hard reality so we're a bunch of pansies now and we fall apart at the seams someone looks at us cock guide or we don't like what this one said or this was wrong how we must stand that that's why i think the lord is being extremely gracious with us in the light of what his future and very close at hand and at the door so the issue of what is prophetic is a life and death matter because when Israel comes to the condition where they acknowledge that we are cut off we are without hope we as dry bones God turns to another and says now prophesy to these bones that they might live the God who spoke himself out over creation in the chaos of genesis does not speak over the the chaos of Israel he turns to another a son of man a prophetic son of man and said you prophesy to these bones now what if we what if we choke in splotters that's over my head they're so stone-cold dead i mean the bones are turned to powder i can't believe for this to prophesy without an appropriate faith is not to prophesy right have you ever felt the virtue go out of you like it's one you have tremendous stamina in prayer to pray for a sniffle but when someone comes in with a wheelchair and foaming at the mouth and in jerks and splotters and then for that deliverance you just feel the virtue go out of you just look at them remember what happened when they came down from the mount of of transfiguration they had seen the lord transfigured in glory with moses with Elijah what a blinding sight but the moment they came down the thing that met them was a kid rolling over in his own puke and and drool who was a habitual uh paralytic what do you call it uh epileptic and they could not deliver him and that if there's any false spirituality that makes us to defer from that command of obedience to address God Israel remains in her grave and so whatever vestige that is falsely spiritual falsely religious falsely deferring that would keep us from an obedience will in that day be the fatal thing so much must we be in God that we can even command him and yet honor him at the same time it's not out of arrogance it's out of a remarkable humility that will obey God even when he commands us to to command him who can come to that where where are we now with in terms of such a relationship with him and how will we get from where we are presently to a relationship of that kind except by the dealings of God while Israel waits on the sidelines they have nothing to do with their own destiny they are out of it and they must be so they shall never boast that was by any virtue of ourselves that we became an answer to the nations that uh how does it say you shall bless all the families of the earth not by any virtue in us whatsoever we were rebellious we were apostate we blasphemed your name in every nation where we were driven we have no distinction in ourselves if we ever become a blessing to the nations it's because you blessed us out of death you raised us up out of death we have no qualification Israel cannot be a factor in their own eternal destiny by the very nature of the thing so the whole premium rests on the church who speaks to the dry bones both in faith and in love and wants to see them raised up out of that death when actually there'll be an impulse to say let them lie listen who needs them and besides i am deprived and esteemed son of the living God and i don't want to see this upstart restored again that would anyway threaten my place of prominence with God so we have to be divested even of any jealousy about our own esteemed place with God which the older son could not bring himself to do when the product will return so the issue is the church so if Israel is going to require such celebrities of dealings what will the church require to come to its prophetic place as the son who can be commanded to prophesy and can prophesy as God to come back to your statement in his authority and even in commanding him and that's why we have to examine every person they phenomenon in that light is what is happening moving God's people toward this maturity and this relationship as sons to the father or is he telling them to lighten up you've been too serious as we said over the breakfast they've been too serious lighten up from what we've been light all along you know so if anybody wants to hear further discussion on the subject of what is prophetic and what is false and how does how is that to be assessed you can see simon for the tapes of last year's school where we spent substantial time on that very important question one thing i'll just say in passing you can be assured that that which is prophetically true is exactly that which will be is exactly that which will be called false and that which is false is going to be celebrated as true and that's been the history of God's true prophets since time in the morning so you'll know you'll be a candidate for rejection reproach rebuke and even death and i talk about um true and false prophets some we hear about the shallow grace of false prophecy is no grace at all but rather a deception that leads to unpreparedness and collapse when the unanticipated calamity falls men want to hear false assurances and comforting words what happens when the predicted calamity falls and they are not prepared having rejected the word of it for the reality in fact it might be a real factor in what Paul says will take place in the last days namely a great falling away that a disillusionment well we thought that God had restored Israel and that this was the return and the state had been established and we had encouraged jews to come and now look at this devastation the land is a shambles its cities are ruined and the people have been dispersed so where's God so this this is an enormous thing and practically speaking if you don't know about it pray for a tentative invitation that has come to me from a man representing the leadership of the body of christ in Israel to come and share with them my apocalyptic scenario which they have rejected over the last three or four years and men who used to say that when art comes the word of lord comes with him have now come to say that that last word was an error and the man might himself even be false but as i said to them you know if even if that's true how about the 20 years that preceded that where it was the word of God shouldn't you have at least at your own expense brought me back and shown me my error and corrected me rather than to leave me in that state in a place of silence and cut off what what a statement of where the body of christ is in terms of its own maturity to allow a man to languish in error rather than to correct him no but now they're talking well maybe we need to hear you again but i've not heard further from them so you can make that a matter of career a false prophecy is not a grace not even a shallow grace and leads to deception and unpreparedness and collapse when the unanticipated calamity falls so this is a critical question of what is true and false in terms of prophetic okay can we go on now to some other considerations the first thing i want to bring up is the issue of national culpability we we have a mindset as modern people of individual responsibility in fact in fact there are not many that even have that but few of us have any sense of collective or corporate or national culpability because God is going to be judging an entire nation and i'm quoting from a old testament scholar that is that secular law has no precedent for God bringing his whole people under accusation a different framework is needed to understand that and only where an obligation exists can an accusation be raised traditional views and the concepts of law make no place for a sense of concepts of law make no place for a sense of collective sin or guilt national culpability and so the scholar is raising the question if a whole people are to be seen under indictment what's the basis for that how how is that to be understood it requires a different framework of understanding than the framework of individual responsibility only where an obligation exists can an accusation be raised so the question is what is the obligation for the nation by which now they can understand that they have a national responsibility before God and i'll give my famous a for the day to anyone who can answer that what is the framework that puts Israel different from all of the nations in a place not only of individual responsibility but national culpability they have a covenantal obligation so that this obligation presumed by the prophets is defined through the covenant relationship between jehovah and Israel and that this view is lost to contemporary jews and even to the church i mean how can we communicate this to jews that we don't have it ourselves what would you say is the most visible evidence of the loss of covenantal reality or obligation even in the church divorce divorce the frequency of divorce i mean the statistics are as atrocious for the church as they are in the world indicates that we don't have a sense of covenantal responsibility i hear this again and again and again where a wife is bent out of shape and rightly so and the guy's been unbearable and why do i have to suffer this and the next thought is the loss where is the covenant of sticking with it and believing God to bring you through it he's a third-fold court and he will but instead we want relief from the tension and the unhappiness of the moment and after all we're still young and attractive and there are other options and alternatives and try try again which is the mentality of the world that is completely disrespectful if not ignorant of the meaning of the word covenant covenant is not a word devised in the world it did not rise up from the earth it came down from heaven it is God's own view it's God's own mentality he's the covenantal making and covenantal keeping God he's the God of covenant or he's not God at all i mean it's intrinsic to God it's a concept that we would never have had except that God himself gave it where would marriage be where would relationship be if God had not given the concept and it's more than a concept it's a reality in which he promises to be a third part a three-fold court cannot be broken two courts in tension against one another will snap but the addition of that third court prevents the two from rubbing and from breaking and that's so what does that require his participation in with people who are married on the basis of covenant and honor covenant and he will honor them who honor him and be in that relationship what he has promised what's God's great lament with Israel through the prophets and the whole testimony of scripture you can't get the covenant yeah but i made with you though you're a covenant breaker and that's why the end of the age begins a new age with an everlasting covenant spoken in jeremiah 31 i'll make a new covenant with you an everlasting covenant why everlasting it'll never ever again be broken i'll make a new covenant not new in its terms or content it's the same one spoken abram to david that God has reiterated in all of his covenants or essentially what makes it everlasting what makes it new is i'll keep it i'll write it in your heart i'll put it in your inmost part of your spirit it's no more externally doing this and doing that you flubbed that i'll do it it'll be unbroken and it'll be everlasting so what we call the new covenant is that covenant the covenant is the name of the game and so we need to ask this question to a for a generation that has not this mentality and it has a non-generational mentality does not see itself related to previous generations it sees itself as autonomous but that's not the way God sees part of the prophetic task and what defines the true prophet is communicating to men things as God sees them however much they are in opposition and pension with things as men choose to see them in the world or even in the religious world it's another sea it's radically different and radically other and the test of the truth of that prophetic anointing and ability and call is not just to communicate that but to communicate it in such a way as to displace what is ever opposed to it and to establish it as authentic in the hearing and the life of those who receive it knowing that to receive that means to put themselves in opposition to the world and open to the world's reproaches and its opposition so it's an anointing that that must be powerful because it's a complete controverting of men in the way in which they think and see it changes their values their perceptions as our brother shared last night he's another man he has another heart he's see everything is different the ability to break in and through against every obstruction and opposition to God's view which the powers of the air have continually immersed mankind in their conventional wisdom is the prophetic call and what a painful thing what what a warfare what an opposition and to succeed in the communicating of that where people will not only be able to hear it despite the contradiction of their own categories and the cost of it but surrender to the truth of it because it has come with such an authority and such an anointing and such a power as if God himself had spoken it because the prophet is the mouthpiece of God so if you know that much we have a criteria by which we can assess those who today bring the blood of his prophets and i've never been so completely unimpressed by the great oracles of the hour as i am now being really jealously to pray for the restoration of the authentic authentic and how abysmal is the discernment of the church that they wouldn't know one from the other they would trample on the one sent of God and dismiss him as false and those that are feathering their nests and stuffing their pockets profit pockets and in the whole them they run after you know you can almost say that the condition of the church is as abysmal as the condition of this room yeah so we have a two-fold call to the abysmal church and the abysmal if one were not enough and it's essentially the same thing which is why at the end God concludes both in his mercy the church will never be able to raise its head with any sense that we have served you our failure will be as tragic and abysmal as it were before us and only by the same mercy that comes to them that and that equally comes to us where we have any place with him so we need to pray for the restoration of true prophetic ministry or the church will never come off that ground that it's presently in and where does such men come from how are they to be produced even if they have the calling you don't come full full bore into a hostile religious environment that is out to kill you where do men come to the place of maturity and strength and the ability to to see and communicate God's word it has to be out of a prophetic community and it may be that what was called the school of the prophets in the old testament was that kind of a reality school not so much as what's that latin word collegium a collegium of a collective group of people who had prophetically disposed they would not hold prophets necessarily but they were supportive of and related to and joined with the prophetic men of their generation okay so i'm asking the question whether covenant is still in force and its stipulations binding even when it is lost to the consciousness of subsequent generations and even to their desire is covenant still covenant when men are ignorant of it or as the world says there's no excuse about ignorance of the law is no excuse the law is the law whether you're ignorant or not if you're violated in your ignorance you suffer the consequence and the same thing is exactly true of covenant so i'm raising a really profound question modern jews have no covenantal sense at all does that mean that that absolves them from covenantal obligation and if covenantal obligation requires and brings covenantal penalty for violation of covenant are modern jews exempt or are they on a thin line of soon-coming disaster that will be the fulfillment of the covenantal penalty remember when the first covenant was made at sinai maybe somebody can find this one talking it says something like and not only with you do we make this agreement but those generations that will follow us they are also implicated and stand with us in this agreement today in other words jews of all generations to this present were subsumed in the agreement at sinai whether or not they were there how do you like them apples so you see this is conceptually radically different from the way that men think so we have a whole world jury that is totally oblivious that they have any kind of connectedness with other jews or a national destiny or fate or judgment but they will not be exempt because of the ignorance covenantal ignorance does not protect against covenantal obligation and covenantal penalty but we have a task to communicate to those who are ignorant these very things and we've not been doing it my people perish for the want of knowledge very likely seems that totally that is knowledge of this kind we talked about deuteronomy 32 which is called the song of moses not the song that we sing about the riders and their horses being thrown into the sea right but a song of remembrance of what would be the consequence of the calamity of the latter days if we forget God and our covenantal agreement and the reason it's called the song is that it was to be memorized and that the fathers were the teaching to their children and they to their own children and then subsequently through every generation that we would be prepared against a latter day's judgment for that failure and which of us were jews at this table ever so much has heard a word about it which which of us ever grew up in a home in which we knew what the book of deuteronomy was or where it could be found and even if we could find it could believe that God is the author of it see what i mean we're totally outside not only of the covenantal understanding but of the biblical understanding so abysmal is the condition of modern day jews we are alienated from the word of God and the God of the word and the covenant of that God but none of that ignorance saves us from the penalty as the victims of the holocaust demonstrated
