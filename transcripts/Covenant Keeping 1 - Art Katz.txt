Covenant Keeping 1 - Art Katz

You know what the word terse means?

T-E-R-S-E. To be compact and to be able to express yourself without proliferation of words.

I don't know if I've ever recovered from being a high school teacher and having to wade my way through long pages of nothing.

It's deadening to the the census. So to be explicit and clear, have your words well chosen and that they express and convey meaning with no small things.

You don't come to that by throwing up a log. You have to write and rewrite and it will do you good. The world of grit.

Because something is happening with habits of mind and you're breaking into the power of slush and indifference. My great lament and complaint about the church is that it does not require enough of its people. This passive sitting and just nodding in agreement with a sermon going home and to the ballgame and forgetting it has left us dull. I said to someone I only know one fellowship for 30 years where they would distribute an outline for personal Bible study at every level. The adults would have their level and the children their level over the same subject. And then it was related to the sermon that would come on Sunday and then they had to answer questions with regard to that in the light of the study they had already been doing. And their papers would be submitted to their group leader like their cell group, their home group, and in it he would pick up any personal problem and he would see that person talk about and help and pray with them.

But that people was growing. Tremendous.

And so if those things are not required of you, why not voluntarily impose them?

Why wait for an assignment? Why not give yourself one?

And say Art I've been thinking about this subject that had come up in class but we went on and didn't devote too much time but it had really intrigued me and I've been working on it and I'd like for you to evaluate these three pages I've written on this subject.

Boy would I be blessed. So if you want an A for the day, voluntarily give yourself an assignment and continue. Make it a lifelong practice.

I wrote these papers without any thought that they would necessarily be used at the Prophetical School but God will get his value out of your work and you will grow in the process of your life. So any question about any of that suggested outline?

Okay. And look at the precious fellowship you're going to have if you're working as a team. Yeah. All those questions. Okay.

Picking up from yesterday the consequences of the neglect or the rejection of Covenant.

Just as a thought in passing, why would anyone want to reject Covenant anyway?

Seeing that the consequence of rejection or neglect is cursed.

Why shouldn't this be as easily kept as easily forgotten?

But Noblet has mentioned what it seems to me the most simple and elementary aspect of the failure to keep Covenant or to keep the law. Namely that it's difficult to do what God asks.

Thou shalt not. Thou shalt.

How about keeping the Sabbath?

Is that the fourth commandment?

Supposing that that were required of us as non-Jewish believers, but having come into the spiritual Commonwealth of Israel and under the requirements of God to the people of God, the Israel of God, that we also would enjoy to keep the Sabbath.

How much of a snap would that be?

Especially on the explicit day that God has chosen the Sabbath day.

Saturday. The day you were going to go fishing. Or that your wife was going to do the wash. Or the family was going to go out for the thing that you needed to wait for the week to end in order to do. And God says, thou shalt not. Thou shalt keep my Sabbath.

I've given you my Sabbath that you might keep it or observe to do it. How many of us would succeed if it meant a restriction on the way in which we thought that that day should be spread? And Isaiah says, the prophet defines the Sabbath, desisting from seeking your own pleasure and doing your own thing and speaking your own words on the Lord's day.

Think of that. Can you do that for a day?

Now we have only to attend church for an hour, but imagine keeping a day for the Lord in which you desist from seeking your own pleasure in an entire day.

Imagine if an entire people could keep that.

What a visible testimony to the unbelieving world around it. That there's an invisible God who is so regarded and so esteemed by those who believe him and love him that they are visibly keeping themselves away from necessary work and pleasure and sacrificing an entire day doing nothing. These people must be mad, or they must really be a God whom they are honoring at their own visible cost.

So what do you think? We've gotten off easy, because we're under the law, we're under grace.

Has God dismissed the requirements of the law? When John the Pithle says, I think it's fair to say that the word grace to the generality of Christians means to be absolved from the obligation to fulfill the requirements of God.

Is that the prophet definition? No.

Whereas grace is something freely given by God by which those requirements can be fulfilled.

Amen. That's true. What's the verse, what's the key verse in Romans that really hits us right on?

Where the law might be fulfilled, not by religious well-meaning intention or legalistic requirement, but by a grace, by the spirit of the law of liberty in Christ Jesus. That the righteousness of the law might now be dismissed from any requirement by those who are believers.

It doesn't say that, but that's the way the church has it.

That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. I only wanted to make the point that covenant breaking, the failure to keep the requirements of God, is the statement of the people who don't want to pay the cost of dissent, that obedience is costly, it's sacrificial, the flesh shrinks from it, even though it's told that the consequences shall be drastic, that the curse will tell you to keep it. You think of Israel's initial enthusiasm, we will fulfill, you know, and they even committed the generations yet unborn to the same covenant. Confession, a national confession that hasn't crossed this much. If you're not familiar with that text in Genesis 15 that the covenant with Abraham and the terror of the dark that came in the sleep and the covenant maker walking between the pieces with the lamp, that's charged with such symbolism and significance about the genius of covenant and God of the God of Jesus as the God who performs it. What Carl Barthes, a lot of Carl Barthes, the theologian, is his hatred of religion, his divine hatred, the Godly hatred of religion. Sounds like a contradiction in terms of come not to, comes to give you life in that more abundant way. So for example, there's a religious way in which the law can be kept and the orthodox Jews have been very proud of the way in which they have kept it, but when you say that God has lessened the requirement or enlarged and deepened it in the New Testament faith, the latter.

It's much easier to keep the Sabbath if it's rabbinically defined.

You can walk only this far and you can do only this, you avoid conspicuous work, you attend the synagogue. What would be the New Testament definition of observing the Sabbath in order to keep it?

It's not defined by rabbis or a biblical council, it's not even defined by scripture. How is it defined? You desist from seeking your own pleasure, speaking your own words. So whose pleasure are you doing? Whose words are you speaking? How do you know that? How do you find that?

If to come into that rest as desist from yourself, just to nail this a little bit, if we are really keeping a spiritual Sabbath, not by law but by the Spirit, would any two of us be keeping it and observing it in exactly the same way at the same time?

How come?

Because what is the Lord's pleasure for you on this day and his pleasure for me?

What if his pleasure is to go on a picnic or to go fishing?

Would you be violating the Sabbath or keeping it?

No, I hear what you're saying. That puts the premium on what?

If you're religious, there's no way that you can even begin to enter such a dimension. Puts the premium on a sensitivity to God by the Spirit by those who come before him with an earnestness and say, Lord, what would you have for me to do? That's entering into his rest, which is much more demanding than just following the religious prescription. You cannot keep that Sabbath without a true knowledge of God. Whereas if it's a matter of religious ordinance, of external obligation, you can pull it off and applaud yourself and be proud of it and even distance yourself from God in the name of God. Lord, God's open purpose is having learned from the seventh day the way of God and the way of rest by trusting in him and not living from our own strength, but this.

But that would be the pattern for all of our days.

In fact, the millennium is called the Sabbath. It's the seventh millennial day in which the believers enter into a millennial rest and cease from themselves and eternally. So the Sabbath is a significant model for God's eternal future.

The good picture is how Moses received the law.

Come up unto me and be there. I will give you the tablets of the law, which I have written that you might do them or teach them. So God, in the very first instance, predicates the knowledge of the law and the teaching of the law, which is to say also the keeping of the law on the basis of relationship with himself. First, come up to me and be there and I will give you. If you reverse that pattern and seek to appropriate the tablets of the law independent of that relationship, you've got plastic rather than something written by the finger of God.

So again, the first instance is telling.

I need to fancy with the paradigm, the pattern, the model that God gives and how Moses himself received the law out of relationship, because it's out of that relationship by which you receive the law that you receive the enablement for the fulfillment of the law. And to sever that connection is to make you only legalistic and religious. Christian organization in England, this issue is devoted to church apostasy. And one of the first questions that they take up is the substitution of Sunday for Saturday in the observance of God's day, which they call a deviation at the beginning of apostasy introduced by Constantine when the Holy Roman Church was established by him and they moved away from Jewish practices and substituted pagan innovations, the Sunday, the worship of sun and other nature pagan practices that were put in the place of Jewish things just to consciously move away. And that if that's true, and I think it is, that part of the restoration of the things that have been lost by the introduction of those deviations, maybe that God is wanting, I don't want to make this an issue here, but the restoration of Sabbath as a seventh day that God himself has sanctified and set apart and implied a particular blessing on that day that has been lost to the church for its ignorant dismissal of it as being only Jewish. So this is moving in the direction I didn't intend, but my only thought was just to remind us the penalty that has come to Israel for the failure to keep covenant and that keeping of it requires an extraordinary relationship with the Lord. Even today among observant Jews in Israel, a way in which the requirements of the law can be maintained outside of relationship with God is through technology. They have devices electronically that turn the lights on and off and give them all the advantages of things that they need in their kibbutz senior agricultural communities which they don't personally perform and therefore they're saved from the violation technically of the letter of the Sabbath by the use of technological innovation. For example, on the seventh year your fields are supposed to lay fallow.

Well how do you do that and maintain your economy in a competitive society? And the answer is that you legally sell your fields to neighboring Gentiles. They work it out with the local Arabs and then they continue to operate it, but it's not theirs.

So they have not been doing their land. They found a legal loophole and feel completely confident that somehow this is God only.

So how deformed is that thing?

It's just remarkable when you're contrasted with what God's intention really is. Through his ordinance and his requirements. In fact it's none of that an exaggeration to say that everything that God has given by way of ordinance or law or requirement has this as its end to bring the true believer into the intimate knowledge of himself. To make clear the desperate need of God as reality and not as concept in order to fulfill what is required. Everything the Sabbath is given for man, God says, because somehow in putting God first our own humanity is benefited and established. And look what's happened with the loss of the Sabbath and subsequently the loss even of Sunday. Businesses open seven days a week and the whole frenzy of the world continues unabated even on the Sunday that we are purportedly to observe as the world's day. In fact they become more frenetic and more harried and more full of frenzy and coming and going and buying and spending.

The parking lots are more filled on the weekends than on the weekdays. So in effect everything has been lost.

But where is there a witness people who are Sabbath keepers and will visibly exhibit to the unbelieving world a sensation from their labor, from their activity, even when it costs them something by not doing it. I think one of the finest expressions of the faith that I've ever encountered was in Milan, Italy by a group of Italian Seventh-day Adventists who had come into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

And they had the advantages of both.

This thing that has been written into their life through their Seventh-day Adventist experience and background and the blessedness of the Holy Spirit. They were precious and they told me what it has cost them in Italy to keep the Seventh-day because in Europe kids go to school on Saturday. Their kids were not allowed to go and somehow God gave them such a grace that the school authorities worked it out in a way to compensate for the absence of the kids on that day. One day was told me he worked for an airline and he had to tell his employer I cannot work on Saturday. And instead of being fired or not being hired, he was respected all the more and some adjustment was made by which he had that time off and made up for it another way. So the kingdom suffers violence and the violent take it by force. Though the world conspire against it, though the world is too busy, though there's no time to shut down, those that will do it and obey and observe, God will honor and God will be honored by that observation.

Well, those who are listening to this tape, this doesn't count.

This is a digression that we didn't intend but we leave it with you for whatever value. The point is keeping the law, keeping covenant is an exacting requirement that can only be performed consistently out of a relationship with God as really known and loved. One of the requirements of the covenant was the treating of the stranger in your midst, the alien who is in the land. And you were once aliens in Egypt and now you're to treat the alien in the land and the stranger who is with you and in your midst as you would treat yourself. If that's a covenant requirement then maybe the heart of a covenant requirement that when you drift from covenant, the first thing that you will fail in and most violently profane is how you treat the alien in your midst. In fact, I'm very fond of saying that the measure of any nation and any people is how the weak and the defenseless are treated in their midst. What we do with the defenseless and the weak is what we are. And if that's true, you can draw your own conclusions about what Arabs and what the Palestinians have experienced at the hands of Israelis presently and in recent times as being covenant failure. And covenant failure always invokes curse so that Israel is living on a powder keg that could go off at any time. I want to take up the subject of the continuity of a judgment. When is a nation absolved from its covenant obligation and the question of whether present Jews are still under covenant obligation under the indictment of failure? What has happened to nullify the validity of covenant? How is Israel now more qualified for what was rejected then? What has changed in the character of the nation that was cast into exile for covenant failure than the nation that exists now? So there's a timelessness to judgments that the modern mind cannot grasp to think that God would still judge on the basis of covenant obligation covenant obligation lies in the face of modern thinking. But a God who requires and a God who will judge for failure and judge violently is totally out of keeping with the modern mindset. Maybe nothing more reveals the contradiction between the modern mind and God's timeless biblical requirement than the issue of covenant. What assured ancient Israel that somehow these judgments would not fall? That though the curse was clear and written in Deuteronomy and Leviticus, somehow in their deepest part, even though the games were being played with God and their hearts so far from him, they did not expect the fulfillment of the curse that resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem the nation and their expulsion from nations.

What why is it talking about a modern mind?

Maybe this is a mentality that's as old as that somehow this shall not come upon us. There's a phrase that I that I use called the inviolability of Zion where something is so horrible that you cannot consider it as a possibility though God has said so. How can he destroy what he himself has given? How can he allow the holy city to be destroyed and the sanctuary to be destroyed? They are inviolable, yet nevertheless what happened and what would be today's inviolability of Zion where today's Israeli or Jewish person or even even a sympathetic church person would say present Israel is not going to suffer again another expulsion or another exile.

God would never do again do that again.

That's that something is inviolable given of God that he would not allow the story to be a contradiction.

Maybe the nation itself?

There was great instruction intended by God in the sending of a son to die and the failure to understand the divine logic which can only be understood in proportion to our understanding of sin and judgment and righteousness. We then have had to experience historically the same issues work out in our whole national destiny. So maybe God's final dealing with Israel is a reiteration again of the same great things sin and judgment and resurrection that we have to learn through the painful experience of an entire nation which only a fragment will survive because we have failed to understand it in the provision of God itself. In the sending of this is a remarkable one if you've heard me say it's worth hearing again the book by Meyer.

What's this book of what is it?

F. D. Meyer on Abraham.

This memorable sentence is almost lethal to page when I read it.

Abraham knowing the terror of sin t-e-r-r-o-r rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass, cut the wood, and took Isaac and made of him a sacrifice.

In other words, he never quibbled with God.

He never said how come or why that you require me to take my son that I love? Knowing the terror of sin there was some instinctive and intuitive depth of knowledge in Abraham as the friend of God even though he may not have been conscious of personal defection or boo-boos or failures but of iniquity being breathed in and breathed out.

Have you ever played that? No, you're not conscious of any personal violation. You didn't rape anyone today. You haven't lied or stolen but your iniquity is ever before you. Oh yeah. You're breathing it in and breathing out. It's with your humanity you cannot escape it.

Knowing the terror of sin and he rose up early in the morning, no questions asked, and he knew that sacrifice had something to do with the requiting of sin.

Well, this is the knowledge that we don't have.

We don't even have it as believers who have been saved from sin, let alone an Israel who is yet on the other side of the pale. This consciousness of sin, covenant, law, requirement, the righteousness of God, failure to keep, has not sufficiently been registered in our souls and for that reason we have not been oracles of God to the nation. We have instead given a false comfort and placated and patted them on the back and encouraged them to go on but have not got the true comfort which is to tell Jacob their transgression and Israel their sins because it can only be told by priests.

Remember what we said this morning?

Only by identification, not some fiction, some fictitious thing that we put on as an affectation in the show. Yes, I paint my shoes or if I identify with Israel in their transgression but a real heart, I've not come to it, a real heartfelt anguish as Daniel, when Daniel prayed and identified himself with the sins of the nation, he was not just praying officiously like I know that I should really identify so therefore I'm saying that he was identified. For him it was true and that's why when the angel came said from the moment that your prayer went up God heard. The only reason that the answer was deferred is that the principality of Greece you know held me back the moment that your prayer went up because God instantly heard a true priestly identification and maybe therefore the whole issue of Israel is really the issue of the church. Our recognition, our heartbroken recognition and that we can speak a word that is convicting not out of condemnation this critical spirit of the people who are failing but as people who have failed and do fail and see ourselves like Paul as the chief of sinners. That was not just Paul's statement of his earlier life that was his continuing and present life.

You want an A for the day?

How does the chief apostle who is the very epitome of holiness calling the church to blamelessness that they might be found without blame on the day the was appearing see himself as the chief sinner?

How come he knows it more than we? Because he was a murderer in the beginning? I don't want to give you guys the answer.

It'll be your answer when you can lay hold of this and express it and this is a great question. It's not and not only Paul's question it's our question because until we come to Paul's place we are not apostolic and we have no apostolic ministry. It's critical and in order to be that kind of power in the world we need to see ourselves as the chief of sinners.

We've got to settle this guys.

This is this is critical or we will condemn ourselves to a lifelong superficiality and to cut off from being of any apostolic use to God. Remember I said about this American preacher at that Ukrainian messianic congregation?

It was painful to hear him there.

My God I wanted to put my fingers in my ears and run out and yet every word he was saying could not be pulled with doctrine or scriptural and he was speaking about sin and deponement and the blood and yet it was excruciating to hear him because we would never have been brought to the consideration of this kind about our own understanding on the issues of guilt and sin except that it had come up in the context of Israel's and that we are not fitted to be God's article to that people if we are still in a place of superior disdain and don't see ourselves as chief of sinners. I think when the day of the revelation comes, God will show the church that it sins in every way are comfortable and equal to those of the spirit. In fact, in light of what we're saying, it's hard to conceive that the two foundational apostles of the church, Peter and Paul, could have been that without first having been either a murderer or having denied the Lord three times before the cup. That this is somehow essential and necessary if there to be foundation of the world of church only out of the brokenness of an experienced profound failure of even your best intentions though all the world deny you yet will I deny you never and then right on that before that echo has even dissipated comes the denial. I wonder though Paul speaks of the great falling away I wonder though Paul speaks of the great falling away if that's not the preliminary to the great resurrection which is that the great falling away is not a permanent and enduring and eternal falling away but a necessary preliminary in shame and scandal and fight from God because of the difficulties of the last days and not wanting to be believers under such circumstances to see our abject failure and then to recognize that the only basis is his life and to come into it in time to be a last days mother people who earned the crown and to ascend to our glory that only a resurrected son of man can speak a word of resurrection to raise the dead nation it's not that Israel had to die that was the offense but that the church would have to die in order to beat the Israel the life-giving instrument that has brought more recoil and more backlash and more rejection from any message that I had before spoken because it pinches the church and makes it to consider that there's the prospect of death its own death before Israel's can you see the genius of God in this that's the issue of Israel that brings us to our own classes we would not have come to the crisis of betrayal were not but he accepted the issues presented to us by the nation in his final extremity as was presented to the disciples by Jesus in his final extremity when they forsook him and fled it's a reiteration it's a reenactment again of a final drama and evidently is no shortcut the disciples could never have seen their condition they really their condition they really believed it when they said though all the world deny you yet will we deny another they said if we have to die and believe it until the night of terror came that stark thing you don't have a word for it you know you can talk about something theoretically when men come with their torches and their roman authorities and apprehend and lay their hands and all of a sudden the life goes out from you and you flee why was i driven to an anguish of soul listening to that preacher in that messianic congregation of kia saying all the right things because he had never and it passed through it in his own experience he did not know sin as the chief of sinners and here was given us collateral sin and atonement it was lifeless because it was not the word of truth in his mouth so no greater danger than just the convenience of subscribing to the things that are merely doctrinally correct for God to spit out on the beach of the church men who have been swallowed up in the belly of the whale for three days have rotted and corrupted in the digestive system of that beast and are spit out on the beach as men of the resurrection whose very appearance let alone their word compels people to repentance in other words that there are that God will send people into the church who are a fragrance of life and for life for some and death after death for others the church needs to see the reality to which they will ultimately be good and they need a model of other possibilities than what they have known they've been fixated at a verbal abstract generalizing level and have not seen the actuality of it and that's what they marvel with Jesus but his authority you don't speak as one of the scribes if you have an authority and that kind of authority is not cheaply obtained so the cross is always at the center and how critical that there will be a remnant who have embraced it and can appeal to the shallow and the nominal to also come in this way and be saved from the other crisis that will compel compel them to see their defeat and their death that that extremes for peter i mean who has a word to describe the mortification when Jesus came out blood running down his head bashed and kept up through the night and knocked from pillar to post naked and derided and and comes out and looks at the man who's been item three times what a look that must have been he must have been devastated so despite his loud profession that he would never deny him talk about repentance and breaking at death and all of that to prepare him to be emptied out of all of his peter-like presumption and haughtiness and arrogance that he could wait like a dead man for 10 days in that room until life would come that is that's that's the baptism in the holy spirit anything else and other than that that is called that by the charismatic movement i think is largely a fraud we have not been profoundly enough emptied that we might be profoundly filled and we need to see ourselves as betrayers of God you know a question that i most frequently hear from my own jewish kinsman what do you mean save save from what yeah it's a very grace of God to show us what we need to be saved because you will not see it in this life we'll see it on the day of eternity when it cannot be remedied and we carry those sins and oppositions to God into eternity the eternal things hanging in the balance entire nation estate and through that nation other nations a restored Israel is God's key to the restoration of the nations
