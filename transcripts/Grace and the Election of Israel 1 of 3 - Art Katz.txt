Grace and the Election of Israel 1 of 3 - Art Katz

I'm just going to read it. I'm leaping right in. If anyone has a copy of Reggie's paper and maybe we'll see that all will have it before we leave. I'm starting on page six. You can believe that from the very first paragraph. It's an outstanding statement. But because of the gravity of time, I'm leaping into the central thing that I believe the Lord wants us to consider, especially for Lloyd's sake, because this is a last day and I want him, I believe the Lord wants him to take home a perception of the centrality of Israel in the way that Reggie sets it forth. So I'm going to read two paragraphs. It's not to be commented upon, although it's rich. It would be a field day, just the shift of those two paragraphs. And then we're really going to begin at the bottom of page six, where Reggie talks about the covenantal reinstatement of Israel as a redeemed nation. That's we're going to come in at that point. But here's what proceeds in part. It's about the truth of unconditional election.

The issue of covenant is the issue of election that God has elected, chosen, appointed a people to be in relationship with himself. And that relationship is defined by the covenant which he himself establishes.

He gives it the terms. Israel is not the one who is code defining the terms, only agreeing to them.

God himself is the initiator of covenant. So Israel is elect to be the covenant or the covenantal people.

And that election, the whole concept of election, even as we talked about it this morning in the nations and they're flaring up against God's choice, is really against the God who chooses. He elects.

And it blocks the reach of reconciling mercy, namely confidence in the flesh. It destroys all hope of a righteousness that is one's own.

Election is devastating because it has not to do with the qualification either of men or of nations. They're not elected because they qualify. They're elected because they're chosen.

And this is a direct assault upon the nature of man in flesh, the desire to be chosen because of qualification. So Reggie is underlining the fact that election itself, which is the basis for covenant, destroys all hope of a righteousness that is one's own. The best virtues of which fall hopelessly short of the righteousness which is Christ's alone. Therefore the most admired of those virtues that can be generated by human will and moral ability can never be the basis of divine acceptance.

That one statement says more about the present mentality of Jews in the world than anything that I know.

What is our distinctive Jewish mentality is that we do have virtues that are admired and that we ourselves can generate out of our own human ability and our own moral ability that should be the basis for divine acceptance.

God says no, that's not the basis.

So there's a basic ideological conflict between this quote Jewish mentality which is to say the worlds that celebrates man and wants acceptance on the basis of what man can generate in himself as against God saying no, there's nothing in men that's good. I alone am good and the basis for my choosing and electing and covenant is not your virtue or your qualification or your morality but simply my freedom as God to choose. That's a direct assault upon this unspoken fortress of human self-assertion, self-will, and self-acknowledgement. So we have to understand that the election and covenant is a whole thrust of God contrary to the whole ideological tenet of the world. When I say Jewish it's yes it's essentially Jewish but the world has adopted it because we Jews are so in the world and of the world and have shaped the world and provide the world's mindset and mentality all with a veneer of religiosity or ethicality or morality which has its center in man and not in God.

You understand what's at stake in the great conflict of the ages as we come to the end. These conflicting views are going to come head-on.

Now to what degree does the church though it subscribes to the ideology of God and the supremacy of God and denigrates man, but in fact live and has its being out of this premise. In other words the church is more humanistic than it itself knows that though it gives a a lip service acknowledgement to the doctrine of God's election, God's choice, and that it may there's no good thing yet in its action, its conduct, its innermost thoughts it is essentially humanistic and one way in what place where that is revealed most conspicuously is its adoration and love of present Israel and its desire to see present Israel succeed on the basis of its humanity as if that could be any basis at all. It is a revealing of the church's own implicit wrong faith because if it is hoping that Israel is going to succeed on that basis on what basis is it hoping that it will succeed and how many of its programs and its conduct and are humanistically derived to obtain certain ends. They have not really agreed to the radicalness of God's view of man and why election and covenant is God's prerogative and that there's no other basis for righteousness but what is imparted both to man and to nations then through the God who keeps covenant and gives himself in covenant. So because the election assumes the total destitution of the natural man as spiritually dead it ultimately becomes the yes of grace to all who justify God's sovereign right to quicken whom he will.

This is typical legend that's why it needs to be expounded, explicated, repeated because there's so much contained in one statement. The election assumes the total you can believe that every word that's being used here is not capriciously or arbitrarily chosen.

This is finally honed when Reggie is saying total he means total the total destitution of the natural man as spiritually dead or else there's no yes to the grace of God in his election and in his covenant. There's got to be an acknowledgement of the death of man in his own inability to obtain anything that's righteous and that's why Ezekiel 37 is so classic a text. God is waiting for this proud Israel this nation of self-sufficiency who has given to the world called Marks and and Eric Frome that I quoted the other day and who's the great psychoanalyst the Freud and and all of the the the movie makers and writers and thinkers and novelists and cultural shapers this people of such vigor and animation so centrally small in number but so influential in their humanity maybe even in the misused perverse expression of the giftedness of God for them for the gifts and coordinates of God without repentance but how are they being employed not for God but contrary to God so that this must come to a total destitution of spiritual death and that's why God is waiting to hear from it as in Ezekiel 37 we are cut off we are without hope we are his dry bones can you imagine a proud Jew saying that or a proud Jewish nation saying that and yet unless they say that God will not turn in his mercy to a prophetic son which is the church of the last days and say prophesy to these bones that they might live he is not released to establish their resurrection until they acknowledge their death and so the question is how is that death going to be obtained by which every natural thing will be rendered destitute in very Israel itself and in world jewelry itself that's why the time of Jacob's trouble is going to be the greatest debacle and catastrophe of modern times eclipsing even the Nazi holocaust and so are you sure that Israel is going to be cast out of the nation are you sure that this is that they're going to be pursued well I scriptures seem to give an evidence of ruin cities devastated land left desolate but what I don't want to say with certainty but whatever it is that will obtain the death God will require it it's got to be this kind of destitution of the natural man it has to be a yes of the grace of God who will justify by his sovereign right to quicken whom he will and apart from work so then it's not of him who wills or nor of him who runs but God strategically has concluded all in belief that no flesh might glory so that mercy might appear to the praise of glory of grace alone if grace is to be demonstrated as free unconstrained and uninfluenced it must be according to election the issue of grace is the issue of God grace is the unmerited givingness of God that has no reflection of any constraint imposed upon him any requirement made of him it is God acting out of his total uniqueness of God who is absolutely free of any external requirement or pressure of any kind it is something utterly free and given of God which is to say that that givingness of God that is called grace is the greatest statement of God as God see what I mean no one's twisting his arm he simply elects to express his mercy that's grace so grace is the statement of God and if nations or Israel or Jews can obtain any righteousness independent of that grace where is his testimony where is the demonstration of him where is the knowledge of God as God if his grace is not made palpably visible and demonstrated on a people who are destitute of anything out of their own humanity and are only surviving or established because of his grace that's why the issue of Israel is the issue of God he wants to demonstrate himself as the God of grace and how amazing is that grace to us if it's only become a glib kind of a thing that we sing whether we have not ourselves been brought to another destitution of our own humanity and that's what God's dealing with us for the residue that remains that we think spiritual is still a semblance and an expression of some cleaving to something in ourself that we call our spirituality that is yet more our humanity than we know and he has to bring it to death that he might be all in all for his gracious trouble or not at all I'm enjoying grace right now I don't know how this is going to come forth I'm trusting the grace of God in finding our way through a complex rich detailed paper that gets at the very heart of the faith Okay, now we come to the real beginning point all of this was prelude I break the law Reggie leaves you hanging on the ropes Bring me back out lunch brother Here's his statement that now breaks Israel into this context With the principle of covenant rejection as background, we turn now to consider the process that affects the covenantal relationship between the two sides of the world the covenantal reinstatement of Israel as a redeemed nation this is the issue of the ages that that nation that God did appoint to whom grace had come through election has forfeited it it has rejected the covenant and has disabused itself and and is contentious of the God who makes it and the most recent evidence is the thought that they themselves can obtain the land without being in covenant relationship with God for the land is not something to be grasped or to be obtained by one's exertion or political or military power but it is given in covenant faithfulness and keeping the land is the critical issue in the issue of covenant and just another aspect of covenant is our treatment of the alien in our midst God makes our treatment of the alien and the stranger the most powerful statement of our obedience to his covenant requirement that we should love them who are strangers in our midst just examining the two things alone of land and Israel's relationship with its strangers shows clearly this is a nation a political entity that has is not acting or seeking to obtain or preserve its place in land on the basis of covenant it's a fact a covenant rejecting people without even a covenant consciousness and the question is how far behind Israel is the church in its own covenant consciousness looking at the way in which our marriages are put up for grants where's our covenantal sense of obligation before God that the issue of our marriage is not our compatibility or sexual satisfaction or any of the other things that are valid but essentially and primarily to the glory of God who is the third-fold member in that covenant the three-fold court that enables us to keep covenant when any of the other two courts tend to slip or about to snap with the break to disregard covenant in marriage is a statement itself and the statistics are just as great in the churches in the world our numbers of divorce and marriage and remarriage are as frequent as theirs showing that there's very little covenant consciousness in the church itself and that's why the church celebrates president Israel and hopes for it to succeed out of covenant well Israel may have rejected covenant and even lost covenant consciousness but the terms of covenant are yet applicable namely the penalty of covenant failure where the forfeiture of the blessing becomes curse where the God who is the one who blesses becomes the enemy they receive that even though they are not conscious that they are under covenant obligation and that will explain the judgments that have come in the time of Jacob's trouble and are already presently gathering and brewing covenant is a very precious thing and something that should inspire the fear of God as as Moses reviewed it in Deuteronomy 28 through 32 bless it if you keep it but if you forfeit it you'll at day you will wish it with night and at night you will wish it with day the sword will pursue you so now how is this nation that God elected in his grace to demonstrate to all nations what his basis for relationship with nations is to be namely a covenantal relationship how is he to demonstrate that if Israel itself the nation appointed for that purpose is out of that relationship and that is the issue of the last days Israel's return not this military political thing that has taken place since 1948 though there's a measure of God's grace in that there's a measure of God's and I always lose that word God's what's the word help me someone providence in the establishment of the state not as the statement of his approval but as setting the stage for setting in motion the uprooting and violence that must have its origin in Jerusalem in fulfillment of scriptural prophecy and then affect all Jews in the world as the time of Jacob's trouble so how is that nation to be reinstated as a redeemed covenantal nation then Reggie goes on there's one condition for which Israel waits that must be realized before the Shekinah glory can return to a resurrected and reborn nation the rebirth of Israel is a nation to bless all the families of the earth except as a nation that has been resurrected it's not Israel in its present chutzpah and energy of dynamic and know-how it may impress but blessing is something else God did not say to Abraham that you're going to impress the nations through your seed you're going to bless them and blessing is unquestionably and intrinsically a resurrection phenomenon if you are receiving blessing at these tables it's only because of that if it comes out of any human ability or religious expertise it's interesting but it's not a blessing a blessing you know even this word needs to be resurrected amen blessing is one of the deepest phenomena that is available to man in the earth that only God can confer and the form through which he expresses it and especially through the church is the form of resurrection because resurrection brings life Adam was a living soul but Christ is a life-giving spirit because he's been raised in the power of newness of life to impart that life and so also the church joined with him in that life being raised from the dead is a resurrection phenomenon and in fact if it is not point-like it's a factor I can tell you there'll be no resurrection in Israel Israel's resurrection waits on the operation of the church in its essential resurrection ability or it will continue to wait in vain forever it will be dead bones unless there's a church who can say to it let your bones be joined together and flesh be put in upon you and the ruach and the spirit of God come into you that has got to be prophetically spoken not as a well-intending spiritual thought but as a resurrection expression that will bring the life and only a church was in the resurrection mode can perform it so the issue for us if Israel is going to be resurrected and the nations to be blessed is is resurrection merely an article of our credo that we subscribe to as being correct or is it the essential issue and explanation of our life and being that we are corporately a resurrection phenomenon we move and live and have our being in him you know why because we're in covenantal union with him and what he has implanted in that union is his life the issue of Israel is the issue of the church but a church of what kind a church that can raise the dead because it itself has been raised from the dead and has not shrunk from the deaths that have come to us even as believers as we experienced yesterday in this room in the sunday morning service we did not withhold ourselves from those deaths we made ourselves candidates for those deaths because we were seeking the glory of God and death is always painful before it's glorious the church's willingness to be a resurrection phenomenon is its willingness to suffer death deaths and what is community but the the greatest provision the platform for these deaths for these deaths in the rubbing the grit and the strain and the tensions of the compacted relationships of the people who do not just see you in the foyer of the church on sunday and say bless you brother but on there on monday tuesday wednesday in every strain of every difficulty of what to do with the five thousand dollar check that has come in the mail when your wife is pregnant and you're living in an inadequate housing and their vital needs that seem to eclipse the need to go overseas and ministry those are real issues that bring up from the depths things that you would not have known you contained and it's always clothed in a spirituality that quotes scripture but what it invariably almost always is is rebellion and self-will that never would have been seen that would have been come to the surface so long as you continue to live privatistically and comfortably and have been the most amiable and admirable of saints its community the intensity of daily relation the grit of it that reveals what needs to be seen and brings us to the deaths by which his life can be triumphant okay so when he sees that their power is gone um and when he's here's ready is quoting from deuteronomy 32 to 36 and again from daniel 12 7 when he shall accomplish to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished the last dealing of God empties Israel of any chutzpah of any natural ability in itself it's reduced when the power of his people is gone and to a comparable measure the same thing is true for the church revelation 13 7 and he gives him how does it say it allows him to make war with war against against the saints and to overcome them he's going to allow us to be demolished he's going to allow our power to be broken that somehow this is in keeping with the great theme that ricky has stipulated that there's required a total destitution of the natural man is crucially that it's our future experience our present experience that we know that we're willing but it will be the church's corporate experience as it will be Israel's because out of that death God will be glorified and now it's how we face that death and accept that death that will destroy the powers of darkness he'll give him he'll give them the opportunity to ventilate their characteristic spite and devastation and violence against us as he did when he allowed himself to be crucified by that same power but how one receives that death is the issue of the triumph of God forever and ever if we're surly if we're pouting if we're resentful if we're how come me why us we would lost the point when we can receive our suffering and our death with the same magnanimity and grace that he received his he made at that time for that reason the powers an open spectacle and broke their power and removed their how does it say it in colossians he stripped them of their of their ominous by by how he received their worst by exhibiting his best the magnanimity of God the ability to forgive those who inflict how are we doing that with our own husbands or spouses is the issue at the end of the age God is waiting for a church that will demonstrate at the end what he demonstrated at the first the magnanimity of the cross and suffering not being resentful he was jeered at he was taught that he was mocked by his own people my God if ever there was a a provocation that would break the the most perfected saint is people for whom you're dying mocking you while you're dying well if that's the way you're going to be if you don't even now recognize that i'm suffering this for you then you dirty bracha brach deserve all you are going to get and this is going to come upon your hand yet fathers forgive them for they know not what they do and this dumb centurion this gentile goat who had never ever opened the bible didn't know from beans a professional murderer who had put many men up on crosses looking at the spectacle of this anguish suffering and the magnanimity that that suffering revealed because there's nothing more revealing that suffering reggie quotes me in this paper crisis reveals an absolute crisis reveals absolutely what we reveal in suffering is what we in fact are there's no time then or any disposition to put on an act what we are through and through by the cumulative grace of God over the course of time in the history of the preparation of our life both personally and corporately is the thing that will be revealed in suffering that's where Jesus would go he didn't take a deep breath and all of a sudden get magnanimous at a final moment what he was in his final moment was what he was in all his moments so if we're easily offended boost so much steps and i'll tell looks at us the wrong way how are we going to take the cross how are we going to take ultimate suffering if we can't even take now a slight issue of offense without reacting in kind as i did with in the last night thank you over something petty and remarkable our brothers right it's the little thing that finds us out yeah so reggie says and ask is this not also a principle that the church must realize for itself if it will attain to its own eschatological victory and fullness in fact that the church does not attain to it Israel will not attain to it because Israel will be inert helpless done in incapacitated unable in any way to exert anything of a human religious philosophical or ethical kind that can save it it will become dry bones the issue of Israel is the issue of the church it has come to its own fullness and its own victory by the sufferings it's willing not to bear humiliations it's willing not to bear and counted all grace counted all privilege thank you lord i needed that and even though i don't subjectively verify that i'll receive that as coming from your hand i'll i'll acquiesce i'll condescend that the brother who brought that being older having a place of authority it has better discern the situation than i myself because i'm too subjectively involved even to be able to understand it but i i bow in submission to an authority even if he's wrong he's right and my bowing is of greater consequence than anything of the of the issue that has been raised and it's by that that we're going to come to that place that we can be for Israel what we would there's a drama going on totally unbeknownst to Israel who look upon the church with contempt and don't know what goes on behind our walls and in our homes and in our meetings and in the struggles that we're facing by which we're being shaped to be for them God's salvific agent it's not going to come by well-meaning intention or running to plant a tree and making nice in fact running prematurely to make nice and to console before the time of consolation is to rob ourselves of any efficacy and any authority to bring consolation under consolation is the the prophet that speaks prematurely robs himself of his own validity and when the prophetic word is really needed he's incapable of speaking it imagine the tragedy that the cross that is the symbol of this remarkable call in reality should become only a church decoration or something dangling around the neck of athletes have you noticed that in their photographs or they were popular rock stars or rap stars big crosses that are removed from the cross it's meaning it's suffering in the sacrifice and are living the very antithesis in a life of abandoned indulgence are dangling this cross and by that negating its meaning so may the lord have restored its centrality and our understanding and our counting ourselves blessed by the privilege of being called to it now there's a title the mystery explained the same mystery of the gospel that seals the judgment of natural Israel gathers in the gentiles the gospel has at once adored faith to the gentiles and the ascatological judgment of Israel who by reason of the hidden fulfillment could not recognize the time of their visitation after generations of being cued by the prophets rising early the plummet of judgment came in the form of the messianic secret when the longer way the messiah appeared in the unexpected role as the eschatological stone of stumbling and rock of offense this is vintage you have to read it slowly but like like any rare wine you don't pop the coat this isn't coca-cola this is rare stuff this has to be held on the tongue and what is he saying you can feel the thing dotting on your tongue but it hasn't yet come to your consciousness so what's the mystery the mystery is that the very intended messiah was not perceived or recognized and was indeed slain that was Israel's intended ascatological visit was the time of their visitation though they had been prepared by the prophets rising early it was for them a judgment in their failed recognition and their opposition to the own messiah who became for them a stumble stumbling and a rock of offense the death of the messiah came as a result of the mystery of his identity who the men say that i am and reggie raises the question why was his identity hidden from Israel to affect the dual purpose of judgment and atonement there was a necessity for Israel to fail to be broken off out of its own trade to miss its own messiah in order somehow at the same time in the mystery to establish the atonement of God not only for Israel but for all the nations you know because they had recognized the messiah and therefore would there have would have been no necessity for his cross what then would be the provision of God for the salvation of mankind is a mystery and the elect the pre-determined purposes of God which peter but as refers to in his first message at tentacles and he says don't think that you're off the hook because you were a participant in the death of your own messiah because he had to die for the sins of mankind does not absolve you you were only too willing to be participant and therefore you're guilty you're held culpable even though by the pre-determined counsel of God his his death was necessary the fact that you had made yourself so willing an instrument does not absolve you but judges you in fact we're under that very penalty now and the one thing that jews cannot bear to hear is the word christ killer because it has been the antagonism that has released wave after wave of anti-semitic persecution throughout the centuries that in every german city the blood has flown in the streets particularly at the Passover Easter time christ killed but the irony is that however it has been misused and satanically employed it's still essentially true but God is ready for prophetic people who can tell Israel their sins and jacob their transgressions not as one being superior in our spirituality and looking upon them as then and getting and setting them right but as ourselves been christ killers our sins have put him on the cross together with theirs and we come to them out of a broken repentance and to persuade them that though he had to die we were all culpable in that death the mystery means that the hidden wisdom of redemption is only accessible by the spirit of revelation wow that's right because there's somebody do say well what did the rabbis say as if a scholar or a rabbi is going to have a better explanation understanding of the mystery than another if it's not revealed the simply enough and God is the God who gives or withholds revelation remarkable and he says to the church i would not have you to be ignorant ignorant of this mystery and yet it's not something uh by which we can by our own exertion of fame it's the mystery if it's to be known is to come through revelation why then does not the church have it because we have not an attitude in this position that seeks it we have not a humility willing to receive it we have our own opinions of Israel and its place and look with disdain and content and to that God will not reveal i remember a well-known speaker who happened to be english living in america came to our church as a young believer and he took such delight in Israel's fullness he almost broke his hands in glee that Israel was finished the church has now been the inheritor of God's purpose through Israel they got what they deserved my stomach was not a and i had not one word to say in answer i was too young i didn't know anything about the subject but i did find we went to a retreat we were both speakers together came down for breakfast the only seat that was vacant was alongside him and i said to this brother it may well be that you're right that God has finished with Israel and that she deserved to come up with the judgments that she has received but to speak it with glee and with delight is altogether wrong and that very attitude would forbid any better understanding of Israel's tragedy than what you possess there's a reason why we don't have revelation God is only too eager to give it if indeed it can be received so the mystery means that the hidden wisdom of redemption is only accessible by the spirit of revelation the mystery of two advents messiah's death and resurrection in the midst of history and in subsequent return of the day the lord was completely hidden from Israel and if this much was hidden how much more the time between the two advents that must see the full extent of the deuteronomic curse they didn't understand that so they understand what is yet ahead for them in their history and the judgment that yet must colonize the time of jacob's trouble so who is the who's the not a people calculated to bring Israel to jealousy in this interim between two advents it's the church you were not a people you were a bunch of dumb heads you were gentiles drinking blood out of skulls you were fornicating like jack rabbits you you were raising uh alters to pagan Gods and running amok and swords and killing and death and mayhem but you who will fall off and without God and without hope in the world God has brought nigh by the blood of their messiah that you might have entree into their commonwealth their comments their blessings their hopes their promises i'll tell you if the church understood that wouldn't it change the church just that one thing would it not bring a breaking and a gratitude that God had mercy on the graham and those who are far off he didn't allow you to remain far off there was only one faith there was only one salvation there was only one nation but he allowed you to come in and be part of that commonwealth like it by the blood of the messiah the church that despises Israel that has seen the things to have replaced it is not the church it's a perverse religious and institutional caricature that can either minister to the lord sheep of the house of Israel to move them to envy no minister to the world it's a self-perpetuating kind of institutional thing that has missed the central issue of the faith well here's another thought that i'm going to move you to envy by a people who are not a people one or so commentators have suggested that nazi germany has been reduced to not a people this great and eminent civilization of the land of gerda fichte hegel nizzi schopenhauer and so on became a no people in the bestiality the veneer of civilization was removed and they became again the most pagan fierce atheistic God-hating and Israel-despising nation in the world to the point of the the annihilation of world jury and they almost this complete destruction of civilization and so they became an old people they lost their distinction as being a nation of civility and culture and God used them as a no people to rub Israel the wrong way in fulfillment of what God spoke through moses in deuteronomy that you would be affected by the people that are no people and you who are once a people shall become not a people until again at the end of the age i will receive you again as my my own so this fulfills the scriptures of the prophets being none other things which the prophets and motors had said should come and brings the stroke of judgment quietly in unexpected advance of the day of the lord it was foretold in the prophetic writings had been known there could have been no atonement for jewish gentile or had they known they would not have crucified the lord of glory but because of the plan although foretold was hidden in the mystery the builders rejected the cornerstone of the entire covenant edifice the secret which is a trap and a snare to apostate Israel becomes a revelation of the gospel to the remnant what was rejected in ignorance and failing to see the mystery that very rejected and failed thing becomes for the gentiles the revelation of the gospel and a door of faith to the gentiles and in all scriptures conform to what stands written prophetic scriptures thus by means of a prophetic ministry the dividing world word veiled in the mystery of incarnation and prophetic paradox passes through Israel like a winnowing sign separating the remnant the true ecclesial assembly of God from the rest who have landed but this is remarkable what reggie is showing here is that the church is that remnant from among jewelry who did have the revelation of the hidden mystery and saw what was the stumbling stone and the offense to others as being God's very permission and it is that that becomes the door of the gospel to the gentiles that they might also be admitted to that same faith retained by that remnant and go on together in the in the revelation and the mystery of God that the church is not some innovation but a continuation of the most holy faith upheld by those who did recognize Jesus as messiah and that you are joined to that body that already existing body of jewish believers is already the continuation of the matrix of the faith that we today call the church i want to read this again that that this paradox passes through Israel like a winnowing side separating the remnant the true ecclesia that's the group word they're called out ones for assembly of God from the rest who were blinded Paul shows that his own turning to the gentiles is according to the judgment threatened by moses this judgment continues through the balance of the period term the times of the gentiles reaching to the fullness of the gentiles so something happens with the advent of Jesus rejected by the builders he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him jews who expected messiah to then give you the power to become the sons of God but going beyond that his grace being so magnificent he admitted into that mystery of the gospel gentiles the called out ones the ecclesia the assembly of God so Paul will show that the Israel of God is now as always the preserved seed the election of grace however according to the revelation of the mystery the remnant of the holy seed is now extended to include a remnant from among gentiles a people for his name these are grafted in to the spiritual Israel of God and by this gain and interest in the promises covenanted with Israel here's a description of the church as the church ordered itself to know itself that it's not itself an innovation or something separate from the contrary to what has preceded it but by the remarkable grace of God admitted into an already existing Israel of God and to its covenants its blessing plumbing and hope the church that lacks this conception and understanding of itself will see itself independent from Israel and also antagonistic to it and will react to men like myself and reggie who seek to bring this message as being threatening to their understanding of themselves as a church and their own purposes and ironically will even use the language of restoration intended for Israel's restoration restoration as being meant for themselves and this is probably the principal friction of of a of the state of the church today in this great issue and that's why one of its leading spokesmen called prophet by all the forming world upgraded reggie and me for being off base and on a bias that we were giving Israel too great an attention to greater significance to greater centrality as if we were robbing Jesus of his glory he was speaking the correct language in the seeming celebration of christ and he believed in present Israel he's for present Israel yes jews ought to go back that that that that that and he's supportive of that but he's missing the issue by a million miles because he has not recognized even the identity of the church as being the very continuation of the faith of Israel and that that recognition is the basis for the church's humility and if it lacks that recognition of its source it will necessarily have an arrogance in its character and spirit that disfigures it as the church because what is the church if it is not the continuation of christ who hit who has learned of me for i am meek and lowly of heart this is God's provision to establish the church's meekness and loneliness and if it rejects its origin and continuation with Israel it has lost that basis it's an arrogant phenomenon in fact jews have historically called the church the arrogant kingdom far from moving at the jealousy it has moved at the irritation and resentment they have not seen their God for their God is lowly and meek and it comes upon the back of the past and Israel is waiting again to shout hosanna when the church will come in the same spirit as its king wow and will not come to that except it sees this that's why they went my brother to go back to hawaii because it comes out of a new tradition of this restoration movement in which this is totally you lose the revelation this is the consequence you'll necessarily become conceited arrogant suffused with yourself your programs your centrality you'll see yourself as the central purpose of God rather than being an accessory of God toward Israel you're not played you're not called to be first fiddle but second fiddle are you willing for that that you're the whole reason for your advent and coming in is to move them to jealousy is to extend mercy that they might obtain mercy that they could come back in a covenantal place and by that all nations will be blessed it's not for you that to have displaced them and become now the central object in yourself your own your supplement a precious supplement and a needed one but only in a certain character and if you lose that character lose that humility and become an arrogant displacement or replacement you will have forfeited the very purpose of God in your salvation for Paul answers the question of normal church have are they fallen are they out of the way are they finished God forbid you should think that but through their fall salvation has come to the gentiles so as to move them to jealousy there's a reason for their fall it has made room for you to be grafted in but what's the reason for that not that you should enjoy your salvation upon yourself but so as to move them to jealousy there's a strategy of divine wisdom for your salvation but if you don't know it you're going to consume your salvation upon yourself you're going to make it a spiritual lust you're going to see yourself as the very object of your own spiritual pursuit and that is self-defeating and contrary to the purpose of God and robs him and you of glory only when you recognize the purpose for your salvation to them and make that the foremost purpose for your being no matter whether you're the church in hawaii or japan or nurnberg germany or egypt itself as i have but had occasion to tell egyptian believers south of cairo and almost into the ethiopian wilderness you have an obligation to the people Israel and God is going to test you because i can tell you with assurance that the day is not too distant when jews out of Israel driven out by the explosive events of those last days will be seeking refuge with you and you'll be tested whether your identification is more with your own egyptian and islamic people than with the people of Israel as the church of God which is the continuation of the Israel of God how you identify yourself will be revealed in how you'll treat them when they come again into your midst are they your brethren as they are his brethren or just the unfortunate victims for whom you have no obligation remembering what they did to you in the Israeli egyptian war what's your identity egyptian or the Israel of God i can't even speak the word Israel in egypt and i was forbidden to speak on romans 11 in a conference of ministers because i would use the word Israel i wasn't allowed to identify myself as a jewish believer and they said art don't you have any other messages plenty but not the one appointed this is what is appointed God wants you to know the foundational thing requisite for your own understanding as the church even in egypt if you're going to be the church and they finally gave in and they had a almost a secret meeting no interpreter would be employed and only those ministers who could follow me in english so there was only a handful from among them and they took notes and those notes since that time had become an underground item and the man who was my interpreter and forbidden has been to the bent Israel school and is now a theologian and a faculty member in a seminary in lebanon and on the same trip we came to Israel and through a contact that i had i came to the foreign the office of foreign affairs at the africa desk and i said to an Israeli intellectual my dear brother i've just come from africa and if you knew what was coming up out of africa out of these black simple saints in love for Israel and a faith that works for my love in intercession and groanings that will accomplish more for you than can ever be obtained around a political table of negotiation you would go down on your face before your God there's something in the economy of God and the wisdom of God that prayer from african saints for this that have no natural reason for that identification or the groanings that are costly has more to do with Israel's destiny and ultimate restoration than anything that men can transact all the more because there's no natural reason what did they ever do for you and when the church will have that same identification this at the very hour when jews will be hated and Israel will be deprecated for having caused world war this or or spoiled the flow of oil or whatever God will have obtained what he's waiting for and when true revival will come and the church will be restored in the image of God's intention from the first unquestionably in my mind when i'm saying it will be an exact proportion to the restoration of this mystery to the church itself this is the heart of its revival this is the heart of its identity this is the heart of its reality it waits for this recognition but it requires a humbling in order to receive this recognition and a willingness to play second fiddle i'll tell you i'm willing to play third fiddle any fiddle at all to be in the orchestra of God and there's a purpose for the salvation however much it benefits him who has received it that needs to be recognized and to be fulfilled and what is that purpose to move them to jelly who's the them this historically obstinate backslidden God-rejecting covenant-breaking people who are blustering his name in every nation who hate the name of christ who can't stand even to see the shadow of the cross fall on them as they walk look in the street they are calculated against the faith against the name of Jesus satan has seemed with through quote christian persecutions forced conversions every kind of diabolical thing to poison and corrupt the consideration of Jesus because there's only one name given on the heaven and earth by a man they'd be saved okay your task is despite all that tragic history despite the field day that satan has had in the spoiling the name of Jesus for jewish consideration you now move them to jealousy where's the bottom of the page and the footnote that tells us how is simply ain't there so you tell me how that's going to be fulfilled and as reggie says later on in this page in this paper can the age be concluded without it being fulfilled if God has intended it as a primary purpose in the salvation of gentiles can the agent or can the church be raptured without it being fulfilled how can we consider that the church should leave the scene before the fulfillment of its most glorious cult toward this people thank you got the picture Israel is central and it's the absence of this centrality and significance that has allowed for the development of a pre-tribulation rapture mentality of a church that wants to escape and miss its golden opportunity because it has lost the centrality of its relationship to this people in the wisdom of God and if the time is short and we have not even begun to scratch at this fulfillment how can there be prophetic conferences where the prophets are non-compass mentis they have other agendas they're telling people their social security numbers and that you have a an aching toe or whatever it is that's a blessing but there's a complete omission of mention of this drama and of this unfulfilled calling and mystery and so we have gone so far as to say the issue that really will distinguish the true from the false prophet is the degree to which this lost mystery is being brought to the consciousness of the church through prophetic proclamation the absence of any reference to it however much it it uh uh applauds present state of Israel is for me it's so facto the raising the valid question of how prophetic is it at all that's how great the issue is that in the avoidance of this centrality in an egocentric church has been the dismissal of how has the church missed it it's there in the word it's in the prophets why haven't they seen it because they have taken those statements in the prophets and have spiritualized them so that the law coming forth out of zion is not a actual place in geography of an actual nation but a spiritual term of an ambiguous kind that refers to believers of a spiritual condition of all times well isn't it true that zion can can have that meaning yes we're not at the expense of the dismissal of the first hermeneutical literal intention of God in the word and the church's obligation and the handling of the scripture is to see what God has intended as literal first before it advantages itself and find spiritual applications that dismiss the literal meaning which is the mystery of Israel there's a reason why the church has chosen to spiritualize rather than to read the literal intent of God and if we'll do that with references to Israel taking that liberty with scripture where does it end and if we have taken that liberty talk about arrogance to stand above the word of God in God's intention and bringing our own superior interpretation that exalts us at the expense of God's mystery what then is the condition of the church through and through and why are its sermons plunking to the floor like lead and why are people going out like so many unfed sheep and why are their marriages collapsing and why are their children piercing their navels and and doing every kind of thing because there's something vapid wanting in the church that has lost its center and reggie even implies more than implies it's a willful rejection and not just a merely inadvertent one and if that's true the church needs the profoundest repentance if there's to be a return for its high handed misuse of the scriptures and the rejection of the mystery that God sets forth clearly in the prophets if it had a heart to receive it and was willing to play second fiddle and come under the purposes of God for that nation to the purposes of that God for that nation as we discussed this morning out of psalm 98 is the purposes of God for all nations so lord oh precious God we only just say this is more than we can contain you're rattling our brain box we can't handle this but the content is too weighty and we're having we're making up for such great historic loss and in one session over a table and wanting to send your precious ministers back to hawaii and their places equipped with a whole framework of understanding another belt on showing another cosmic view of the faith where the right center has been restored and lord sir we ask grace we need grace even to discuss by God the flight from grace and so we're asking your blessing we've been receiving your blessing and enlarge us for stretch out our cause loose our stakes give us a greater capacity to receive my God the riches of what you have wrought in our brother reggie my God and make it our own to assimilate and make it our own thing that we might persuade my God of what has been so long lost and we thank you give you praise for the privilege of this day
