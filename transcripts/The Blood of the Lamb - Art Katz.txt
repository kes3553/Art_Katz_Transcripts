The Blood of the Lamb - Art Katz

Open our hearts to hear, to receive the word, not only as instruction, but as event, something that goes into our deeps and performs a work there. Thank you again, Lord, for this privileged time. Enjoy yourself, Lord, take your liberty. Receive our gratitude, inexpressible gratitude, Lord, in Jesus' name. And maybe look over the familiar text of Exodus 12 together. The Lord wants to open dimensions there that we have not glimpsed before, because the word is always infinite and unlimited. So at any point where something stirs in you, raise your hand and we'll welcome that as we want to draw out, exegete, draw out the meaning of these verses.

Verse one of chapter 12, the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt.

I'm glad that Aaron was not excluded, because he's symbolic of what is prophetic as Moses is symbolic of what is apostolic, and both need to hear and to express what comes from God.

This month shall be unto you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house.

Ten is a significant number, ten commandments, ten days in the upper room. Ten has kind of a resonance of judgment.

And if a household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls. Every man according to his heeding shall make your account for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats. You shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. They shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it. They shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire and unleavened bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor sotting at all with water, but roast with fire, his head with his legs, and with the pertinence thereof. And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire. Thus shall you eat it with your ones girded, your shoes on your feet, your staff in your hands, and you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the Gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am the Lord, and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are. When I see the blood I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. You shall keep it a feast by inordinance forever. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. Even the first day you shall put away eleven out of your houses. For whosoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that shall also be cut off from Israel. And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you. No manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. And you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread throughout, and on the same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day in your generations by inordinance forever. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month that evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the first twenty-first day of the month that evening. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses, but whosoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger or born in the land. You shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations, shall you eat unleavened bread. And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the Passover. And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel in the two-side post with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you should go out at the door of his house until the morning, for the Lord will pass through to his mighty Egyptians. And when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two-side post, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you. And you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to dig into thy sons forever. And it comes to pass when you're in the land which the Lord will give you, as he has promised you shall keep this service. Verse 26, it comes to pass when your children shall say unto you, What do you mean by this service? You shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover which passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses, and the people bowed their head and worshiped. And the children of Israel went away and did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron so did they.

Well the door is a remarkable function coming in and going out. Everything has to pass through. So it implies the totality of life needs to be under the protection of that blood. Jews post their little mezuzah on the door with a scrolled scripture and touch it coming in and going out is but a faint reflection maybe of this early advent. Something begins with God that is totally unheralded in human experience and is even contrary to human sensibility and rationality. It's simply a provision and a requirement of God, a lamb and blood. But the unwillingness to defer to the foolish requirement of God means death and obedience is in submission to it means life. So from the very advent of the history of the nation there's an issue of God and his sovereignty being expressed through Moses and Aaron that we need to reflect upon and take it to our own deeps of what is represented here and not just any lamb but a lamb taken on a specific day in a specific month which will now be made the first month under you a whole change of your calendar and you keep that lamb on observation until the 14th day four days public ministry of Jesus was three and a half years but in biblical reckoning I have counts for the whole so he was on observation and when he was apprehended he would say to his accusers which of you can accuse me of sin will you find blemish of fault for if you can I forfeit my identity as the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so something was being established here from the first that is so deep that maybe the Lord before we go into any other consideration who want Lord wants us to go back to the beginnings of the sounding of this very thing as a theme I can't get Beethoven's fifth symphony out of my mind something is sounded and then it goes on it plays its way all the way through until it ends on that same majestic massive great notes so we had to have that we we inserted the symphonic weight of God's wisdom and counsel from the beginning with the blood of a lamb out of the flock in the first year perfect without blemish hold it for four days examine it make sure it has no defect or it will be a disqualified provision and then on the 14th day all the congregation of and then on the 14th day all the congregation of Israel will slay it if you've never slain the lamb I can recommend it for you because I've had that experience you had a pass over here and the brothers were dragging the lamb to be executed with a rifle and I was on the top of my landing looking down aren't you want to join us is not me I walked back into the Lord said you go down and you do it not with the rifle with a knife I'm a kid who grew up in cellophane wrapped meat let alone that I should slay and I asked a brother for a knife we we hitched that lamb up by his hind feet onto a limb and I split his throat I watched that blood so all the nation was being instructed that something must die for the nation and for the world and but without the death the life cannot issue for the life of the flesh is in the blood and as we said this morning it's more than its biological activity we know that the life expires when blood subsides but life is far more comprehensive than its biological nature that this land symbolized by the land slain that life was holy and only the blood of that holy life was a sufficient expiation for the sins of the nation and of all mankind and only one could bring death and that was the Lord himself so there is a precedent of cutting and bleeding and walking through the cut parts in genesis 15 and the establishment of covenant and later on in sinai moses sprinkles the blood of sacrifice upon the covenant Israel is making with God and upon the nation itself and then of course in the new testament he said this is my blood shift for you new covenant so the theme of blood from the beginning that red theme runs all the way through even to the present hour so don't let the important i'll call you just a moment sir before to escape you this is the issue of the primacy of God the issue of God over us against the issue of man what what Israel might have done to affect its own salvation is hard to imagine to be imagined but only God could set in motion the deliverance of their nationhood by the expediency of the land's blood nothing that man could ever have conceived so something is being inserted or asserted from the very beginning about God as God over as against man in presumption and human will that needs to be deeply reckoned on for that's the principle issue even today not only for Israel but for the church the primacy of God and what he chooses and our deference and submission to that choice one one statement of the degree of the loss of this to us presently as the church is the infrequency by which the blood is invoked by now i mean any number of cases of homes that are being deranged and ravished and i asked the man do you invoke the blood in your morning prayer to cover your family in your house and he looked at me what i like what am i supposed to do so there's we're not availing ourselves of a remarkable provision that has efficacy still and my own practice in the morning prayer and evening prayer is to invoke the blood upon anger upon the children upon the household upon the benedict community that we have a priestly function to perform and we mustn't neglect this provision we're suffering much more than we ought and leaving ourselves exposed to the ravages of the enemy because not only does the lord not see the blood but the enemy doesn't see the blood when he sees the blood he's terrified and flees but when there's no blood invoked he has an entree access to do his mischief so you just ask yourself how often in your own prayer you invoke the blood or seek to it that your husband if he's a believer is doing so and we're not um erroneously avoiding the precious provision that is valid and still and that it doesn't become on the other side a cliche the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus you know we run the danger either of neglect or a misuse by by mindless frequency we're somewhere between where we need to esteem the blood in a way in which it doesn't become a chant and we're invoking a little mimic phrase that has lost currency and this is not easy to retain so think on that and struggle to keep the the purity the privacy of the blood and to invoke it with a faith that's real and priestly and see the difference in a way in which we're spared from the mischief of the enemy who otherwise has much sway into our lives homes and communities it's part of the privilege of our so great opponents that we're called to share in the no chiseledek priesthood so don't allow yourself to be cheated because of some kind of sense of embarrassment who am i to presume to priestlyness it's yours not by any virtue of yours is yours my gift my impartation by identification with the high priest allow confession even Jesus in fact everything needs to be seen as a priestly function wouldn't it change everything it would affect what we call secular mundane every day if the halo the resonance of priestness would have been produced even in conversation even in the ordinary aspects of life so far that they can be considered ordinary that the sense of priestlyness that enhances that touches that praise that conveys blessing that communicates authority would be brought into the aspects of our life so bachelors sleep somewhere in the 70s a little book on the royal priesthood and she cries out where are the priests today the world is dying for the want of blessing is under judgment but where are those who exercise or can exercise priestly authority to bless us so but it's got to bend over to dip and he's got to use a lowliest scrub as his brush and then reach up and touch the doorposts and the overhead post which by the way in doing so he's making the side of the cross so everything here has to do with lowliness humility submission meekness yeah if there's any complaint that offends human sensibility human taste i've never done this before i've never gone this way then that will come to your house but it's all charged with remarkable significance in front of you including the plant history and in song 51 david and plaza scrub me you know with this up that i might be clean maybe an analogy would be confession of sin if we are unwilling for the humiliation of confession the blood has no efficacy at all it's only when we come clean hyssop when we strip and put before the lord our transgression that he can take it away if we hide if we justify ourselves if we're unwilling for the humility of shame we lose the benefit of the cleansing so there are many applications we can derive from dwelling upon this precious text i appreciate much has been lost much needs to be restored and if we don't restore this where do we go from this we don't restore the priestly function of what else shall we be capable what can we undertake and what do we perform if we forfeit this most basic identity which itself rests upon our own spiritual understanding and appropriation of the blood if we have nothing grounded here nothing follows of any value and perhaps this is where the church has lost it and needs to be restored and be returned the word that comes to me is the issue of the blood is the issue of what is uttermost and when we're reprimanded by Paul have you resisted sin until blood remains have you really gone into your very deeps the blood the quintessence of your being to fight against sin so if we have missed the uttermost of the blood here well we know it in our own experience in the battle against sin so blood we were talking about more than just corpuscles we're talking about the uttermost dimension of being of will of consciousness of life being given over that's what Jesus gave and we're invited equally to give and live out from the uttermost of our being but very few of us do we're not giving up from our blood we're giving out from our surface we're giving from the superficial aspect of our life that doesn't cost us that much but the deeper things are not touched we're not resisting until blood with where you can't you've not tasted blood in the depth of your intention for God so the word uttermost blood is a simple statement of the uttermost when Jesus gave his blood he was giving the uttermost of what he is both as God and as man and that's why that sacrifice was acceptable and why it's eternally valid it's infinite and unlimited and the quality of it is holy holy holy it was tested in his manhood and found acceptable because he was a land without blemish so we will not be giving out of our uttermost until we comprehend that he gave out of his uttermost while he was shedding blood calvary great clots of it as sweat his disciples were sleeping i say the blood of Jesus began by being extruded before it was extracted something came from within by the groaning in his soul of the depths of what was before him that made blood to come out as clots of blood falling to the ground that's the uttermost the groaning and here's the high priest himself who is not only the sacrifice but the bearer of the sacrifice and showing what priesthood means in groaning and travail onto blood that is extruded by the strain of that impending sacrifice so we need indeed to approach a Gethsemane in our own experience one of the most precious experiences in Israel was prostrating myself over the rock in the garden of Gethsemane they built a church over the spot the ancient doll trees are still there gnarled and twisted and inside the center is a rock which tradition says where Jesus prostrated himself and and extruded sweat the drops of blood and i take myself over the place and made a covenant with God to the uttermost the author of isaiah 53 who was given more revelation on the suffering servant himself saw something in the lord high and lifted up that evoked a cry for which God was waiting that he saw something about atonement he didn't just see the lord exalted in the throne he saw the whole process of humiliation to exhortation in a flash of revelation that left him undone and showed that he's a man of unclean lips and he lives in the midst of the people of unclean lips for such a cry to come from a prophet indicates that he's seen a depth of blood and this meaning about the human condition that he had not previously understood and until we cry out i'm undone there's no sending so we wait for a revelation that came to him in the year that usiah died of this very thing and except we we see it and receive it as revelation we do not see it and receive it adequately at all we just converted into doctrine into acceptable statements of faith and credo but it does not qualify us to be sent the qualification was a deep cry that isaiah saw in a flash if this sacrifice now that i'm glimpsing it was for the sins of mankind in which i'm including concluded how deep is the depravity of our condition that requires it i did not recognize that before but i'm seeing it now and i'm undone so our appreciation for the blood is relative to the consciousness of our need and if we see ourselves as more or less circumspect saints acceptable keeping our noses clean we'll give to the blood a token appreciation but it will not qualify us to be sent and the object of being sent is to be sent to Israel because the word the word that came to them brought judgment made their ears tick their hearts heavy they could not hear could not believe to understand but it waits for another sending in which their ears will be opened and that they can believe because they're hearing the word from one who is sent because he can be sent he has seen the heart of the mystery of the faith in a way that has registered in the depths of his own soul because it says the pillars of the church moved at the cry of the seraphim holy holy holy is the lord who holds the whole of his for this glory and when i preach it i say that it was not only the temple out of which the the foundations were moved it was in the life of the prophet himself all of his perfect correct categories of faith were moved out of joint and who welcomes being upset like that and having our foundations lurch and topple will it ever come together again but that's the impact of the revelation of the heart of this mystery of blood of the of sacrifice of the land it's the statement not only of God it's the statement of the truth of man as man and until that is registered our faith in every category will suffer loss this has got to be restored and we need to pray for the revelation of it as it came to isaiah and raises the question why did it happen in the year that king usiah died was that death a critical key for the release of the revelation did isaiah have some kind of umbilical attachment to this king who had become leprous that would exclude the deeper revelation of death had to go first that freed him from attachments of a soulless kind that he would be free to receive the deeper revelation what is the isaiah in our life what needs to die in some attachment that we have that is not evil it might be good it might even have served benevolent purposes previously in our life but it's gone on too long we mustn't fail to consider that the lamb is not only the enablement the provision through blood but the enablement for journeying in the consuming of the lamb we mustn't neglect this part of the text that's if they eat that lamb entirely with the legs and the pertinences thereof don't be fastidious and and just pick about the places that you like to be the whole lamb and Paul boseman that i did not withhold from you the whole council of God so um it's remarkable first the blood to keep away death and then the consuming of the sacrifice to continue the life and the journey through the wilderness and so if we're fastidious eaters we're not eating adequately or at all will perish in the wilderness stagger and fall we need the whole lamb the sacrifice of the blood and the whole totality of what he is even in his appurtenances the kishkes as we say the it is the in the inward um what they call it uh coils intestines kinds of things that we would avoid probably have the deepest nutrition and meaning so we mustn't shrink but take the whole lamb well it shows that the eating in verse 11 is preparatory to the exodus and the remarkable wilderness journey that's ahead for this people and where does it say about either the whole in verse 9 verse 8 roast with fire and unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it these are the essential ingredients of today's Passover unleavened bread bitter herbs but there's no lamb on the jewish table so they're missing the key ingredient but the bitter herbs are not only the reminder of the bitterness of our past and history but most recent history and indeed there's a bitterness of things that are yet to come which those herbs are a reminder what do you make of roast with fire roast with fire not sodden or more it's got to be consumed nothing made disciples to free Jesus more than that radical statement that john except you eat of my flesh and drink of my blood you have no life in you so the lord was making reference again to himself as the lamb still available to be devoured and except you eat of me you have no life and that's as much a injunction for us now as it was for those from the address so are we eating from the what would that mean now eat from the lamb drink of his blood to have the life of God which is also the character of God not only an enablement of a grace of energy but the sovereign substance of his life it is the divine life we can't fabricate this we can't imitate this only that life is sacrificial by its very nature and anything less than other than that is imitation that will fall short if we're going to explicate and show forth the lord is to the degree in which his life is our life has become our life and we're living by that life because we're being fed by that life can we obtain the value of this meal unless our loins are girded and there's a staff in our hands and that we know that we're pilgrims and process if we have settled down where we have lost our pilgrimage and we're not in the process of attending or making it and are we losing the value of the meal it's only of value to those who are girded with staff at hand and ready to march so we mustn't lose this aspect of the of every detail of the provision given in the very first statement for what is given at the first is a template a paradigm of something that carries us to the end and probably not only has to be the neglect of the appearances there's been the neglect of the staff and of being girded that we don't have a stomach for journeying we have to settle in to a charismatic mode of life that's quite comfortable and is the issue of only enjoyable services and we don't realize that we're on a quest there's a destiny a mission and it's demanding is ultimately demanding and when those things have been restored we'll receive the value of what we're devouring we'll eat with another appetite and we'll not be so squeamish as to avoid the unattractive aspects of that deal we'll welcome it all the war for there the nutrition is degraded the text goes on later to talk about what Paul does in first Corinthians and even as our fathers speaking to greeks identifying with Israel past were baptized under moses in the sea and in the cloud what follows this departure is a passing through water and a baptism in the spirit both of which have suffered loss in our time baptism has been rendered a ceremonial form and being baptized in the cloud the baptism of the spirit has suffered neglect even by pentacostals and charismatics so it shows that we're not following the pattern because if we have listed at the first week we missed the succeeding things that need to be completed in the making of the journey so we need to contemplate what is the journey to which we're called what what is the thing from which we need to be girded with staff in hand what is the destiny and calling of the church that needs to be enabled by the land and then passed through water of separation a true baptism and a true baptism in the cloud in order to pass through the wilderness to the taking of the land and the establishing of the holy place of zion that that the neglect of these great sacraments shows that we have moved greatly away from the pattern of things given at the first so i was in wales on my last trip and one of the very churches involved in the wealth revival in 1903 and stayed with the son of the pastor who shared with me the burden of the terrible neglect of the gifts of the spirit and the baptism of the spirit even among pentacostals and even among the descendants the wealth descendants of those who experienced that radical revival at the turn of the century and that his passion was for the return of the primacy of the holy spirit but will we have it will we seek it unless we know that we're in an earnest journey and we need all of the provision that God has established the neglect of these things has had a terrible statement that we have settled upon our leaves and we're not really journeying and what is worse we have no desire for journeying we want to settle in on this place and enjoy the benefits we have no sense of destiny or the conclusion of the age or what our role of function or calling is and therefore all of the other things have suffered so it's good to be returned to the pattern given at the first the blood the land the baptism through water the baptism in spirit and the journey so as we'll talk about later covenant is a bond unto death talk about it part of most it's not some light contract if you fail in common and there's a covenantal penalty or even a curse it's death that's simplified by the animals that are cut up but abraham didn't walk from those parts only God himself indicating that when the covenant is broken and the curse has to be paid God himself will pay it it's already a preview that his he will send his son to take upon himself the curse of the covenant in his own death so we'll talk about this again later covenant is solemn and it's a bond unto death and again another symptom that the church has lost the significance is the frequency of divorce in the church as much as he's in the world we've lost the sense of covenantal respect reverence of the keeping of covenant and the belief of the God of covenant to be a threefold chord a third cold chord in however strange the relationship there is is not to be broken but to be to trust the covenant keeping God to bring that dimension that will save an otherwise hopeless situation from divorce because he hates divorce so covenant needs to be restored i'll read you a little bit here so much loss that needs to be regained the church is no longer covenant conscious we have failed to grasp the importance of covenant theology covenant thinking and covenant living so our fleeting relationships are willing to part to suffer divorce not only in marriage but even from fellowship to find some other suitable environment because where we are is difficult strange unhappy we don't want to eat the the the appearances we don't want the tragic and the difficult part we wanted where the eating is easier so all Gods dealing with men have a covenant character it has so pleased them to arrange it they will not deal with us except through covenant nor can we deal with him except in the same manner there's a fearful woeful whack in the church today we will do much to deepen the realization of our relationship to God as his children reawaken our sense of gratitude to him and invigorate our sense of responsibility to the God of covenant which is the issue of worship worship is relative to the recognition of covenant and the God of covenant and the God who makes himself the sacrifice for the curse of the covenant and pays the penalty of death and restores us with an everlasting covenant in which he himself will be uh not a lord giver but the lord fulfilled the law fulfiller that this appreciation for God as the covenant making and keeping God is maybe at the whole heart of the true respect for and reverence that culminates in authentic worship and the lack of a true note in our worship is proportionate to the loss of this covenant consciousness everlasting covenant brings in the whole issue of eternity which is a missing dimension in our thought and consideration very serious omission so the covenant that is eternal and everlasting brings with it the whole issue of eternity which we do not reckon that we lose significance in our present moments eternity is not only a subject to be considered for the distant future it's something to be reckoned on in our present it changes everything if you have an eternal perspective and that comes in proportion to recognizing an everlasting covenant so so much is appended to the issue of covenant that the lord wants us to explore and to more deeply appreciate in this space
