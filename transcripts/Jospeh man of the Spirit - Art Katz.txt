Jospeh man of the Spirit - Art Katz

I think that what the Lord wants to speak out of my mouth tonight is about a son of whom I have not spoken in some time. It's one of the earlier messages that the Lord gave me, and I've not spoken it in recent memory. The story of a son that was born out of a barren mother who was dearly beloved of his father but despised and rejected of his brethren, whose name means added on. She said, the Lord has added me a son. His name is Joseph, and he's called a fruitful bow. So, just because I've spoken it before doesn't mean that I know what's going to happen tonight. The Lord just does something on the spot, and I'm going to trust him for that, in putting together a whole bunch of things that have been percolating in my spirit since I have arrived here. So, I'm just going to ask you to join with me in a final prayer for the miracle and the wonder of the God who speaks.

Do you believe that? Do you can speak through a Brooklyn accent? So precious God, Lord.

If we could dare to presume upon you tonight, we would ask not so much for a message as we would ask for an event. That this might be an event in the lives of your people, Lord. And the phrase that was coursing through my spirit as I sat on the bench tonight, the sacrament of suffering, explain to us, Lord, what that means. Speak to us, mighty God, out of this ancient son, of the kind of son that is still beloved in your sight, still a delight in your sight, still a savior to many. Show us something about the man and his character and how such men are formed and whatever else is in your heart to pronounce.

Lord, may we hear your voice.

Speak now, precious God, for your servants here will thank you and praise you, Lord, for the wonder of it. In Yeshua's holy name we pray.

Amen.

I think I'm going to be speaking largely out of the Amplified Bible tonight, beginning out of the 39th chapter you can follow in whatever edition you hold. I almost feel as if this has got to be brought forth through travail. It's interesting that the same mother who birthed Joseph only birthed one other son, and she died in the birth of him. She called his name Ben-Omi, which means the son of travail. Only two sons came from her. The previous sons came from Leah, whose name means weary. And maybe they were wearisome sons that did not give their father the naches. That's a Jewish word for the satisfaction and the delight that he had in this son that we're going to describe tonight. This son was different from all the others.

He was a dreamer and a visionary. Remember that?

They hated him for his dreams and all the more for the words which he spoke. Why is it that there's something in me that is relatively indifferent to the persecution that shall come from the world?

I don't mind that.

So much as my spirit is acutely on God for the persecution that's going to come from the so-called brethren, those that shall kill us and claim that they're doing God a service. See, the world doesn't talk like that. I like a story that begins with the words, and Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Going down is never a pleasant experience. But I think that every true overcoming son must have his real biography begin with being brought down. This young dreamer, the 17-year-old youth, was cast into a pit. It says a dry pit in the wilderness, and many of you have never yet been brought to such a place. I wonder if it's going to be compulsory or voluntary. I wonder if such sons will have an option of choosing one of two places in which they can fall into a barrel of goodies or into a dry pit in the wilderness.

You remember where it happened?

It was a place called Dothan where Jacob had sent Joseph to go find his brothers and see what they were up to. I suppose they needed a bit of observing, and he found them in that place called Dothan, which I learned today means two wells. The one into which Joseph was cast by them was a dry pit, and the other, I suppose, was a well from which the sheep or the flesh was watered. And maybe those are the only two options that sons will have at the end of the age.

Am I getting mysterious? Too symbolic?

It wasn't too long ago I was cast into a kind of pit of disillusionment myself. It was in a great city of Philadelphia where I had about three days of meetings, and the first began at the mansion of a great businessman in the insurance business in a meeting that night sponsored for the Jewish parents of the believers of the Philadelphia area. There's no reason why they would come to hear me, but they would come to inspect the home of a millionaire. And we had fasted and prayed three days for that one meeting, and God gave me that day a message on hell. I have never spoken it since, only one time, and we came with such expectation to that meeting. I had been joined in a covenant of fasting, and by the way, if I'll not say it again later tonight, fasting is a form of suffering. Suffering is another name for dying. We were so persuaded that God was going to zap those parents with such power that if they had not come to their senses by the radical conversion of their children out of drugs and every kind of filthy and occultic thing in the world, then surely the power of the Word of God that night was going to bring them on their faces in the terrible fear of hell. And so I remember stepping up to the batter's box fully confident that God could not fail, and something went amiss.

Have you heard about the proverbial going over like the lead balloon? That was me that night. It was zero. It went nowhere.

And when I finished my painful remarks, you know from the beginning that they're going to be painful, and yet you're required to complete it. I'm speaking some mysteries that a lot of you have never experienced, but your pastor seems to be of the conviction that God is preparing you for ministry, so you had best take notes. The day will come where you'll know that the moment that your mouth is opened that you've had it, and you'll not know the reason why. You have fasted, you have prayed, you have prevailed, you've had assurance in your heart that this is it, and from the first syllable it falls limply out of your mouth and bounces to the floor. And when I finished with that, what I thought would be an impassioned address on hell that would devastate these Jewish parents, they are mildly yawned and patted their lips and went out to the coffee table, and they're completely dismissed that which they heard. You know what's always so excruciatingly painful about occasions like that? It's the disappointment of the believers. It's the faces of those who had great expectations and thought that you were the anointed mouthpiece of the Lord. Well, I had yet another occasion to redeem myself. It came at Drexel University the next night, 85% Jewish, and God gave me again a fresh message that afternoon, to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed. I was so excited by the uniqueness and the originality of the word, I couldn't wait to get up there to speak it. And when it came time to speak, I was like a man locked in. I couldn't so much as raise my voice or lower it. It went forth in the most deadly monotone. I couldn't so much as punctuate the word with a gesticulation of my arm. I was locked in to monotony.

Strike two.

Well, the next day I dragged myself to some kind of a Catholic retreat center, thinking, what am I doing in ministry? Surely there's been some colossal and grievous mistake, and nothing good can come out of me. And out of that terrible weakness and enfeeblement and despair, when I finally got up to speak, it was as if the hinges had come off of a door from the furnace, and whoosh, out came a blast of God that utterly wiped out several hundred Catholic men with their pockets bulging with cigarettes and cigars who had come for so-called retreat and shall never be the same. I never saw a priest more perplexed who came up trying to tidy up after me. As men came down the aisle, their knuckles white and their faces solemn to take my hand, knowing that they had come for Locke and would return to their homes as radicals of God.

You know what I wondered?

How come God could do that for Catholics and not do it for Jews? I had struck out twice with my Jewish people and succeeded gloriously with Italian Catholics. The next day in the final service was at a messianic center, and then the Lord explained out of my own mouth why it is that I had so struck out infamously before my own Jewish brethren. It was necessary that I might decrease, that he might increase, through Jewish young men who were intimidated and never would have aspired to service, because are they going to be another art cats? But when I saw that art cats were zero, they were encouraged to think that maybe they might be servants of God also. They were born out of my humiliation. It wasn't pleasant, but it was needful. Well, my next stop was the CBN studios in Portsmouth, Virginia, where I was to follow such men as Bob Mumford and great teachers and speakers, and I thought they had made some kind of a clerical error. How do they invite the likes of me?

I thought, well, I'd better get to a motel room and get some rest before tomorrow morning. This is important. I thought I'll take the limousine into the motel and that's it, but there was some guy waving wildly at me when I stepped off the plane in a wild sport jacket. I said, do I know him? He was from CBN, and he was going to take me down to the motel, and we just never got there directly. We passed the pizza parlor, and you know the way we Jews are with Italian food.

My mother always thought she got the wrong baby from the hospital.

I played hooky from Hebrew school. I didn't like herring or gefilte fish, but I loved lasagna. I hadn't had a hot meal in three days, and I said to this brother, let's just stop for a piece of pizza. I can take it to the motel room. So after I got there, he said, Artie said, you know, what's the point of going to your motel room? Why don't you come to my house? He said, I'll give you iced tea and ice cream.

When he said the magic word, I was defenseless.

So I went to his house, and I finished, and he said, listen, it's Sunday night, you want to come to his service? Oh no, man, I'm over-serviced. But I went to his service. We got in late, and I had hardly taken my seat when the lady who was conducting it recognized me, and brother Katz, would you bring a greeting?

You learned last night how good I am at giving greetings. My heart started racing, you know, when you know that God has staged something where you're not supposed to be, but he intends it. You find yourself on the platform. All of a sudden, foolish things are coming out of your mouth. You're speaking about holiness and worship, and saying that nothing lends itself more to corrosion than worship, and that what began in great authenticity will, if we do not keep our hearts with all diligence, cheapen and corrode and become some kind of mechanical abracadabra of choruses of amens and hallelujahs, and we will not even know when we've departed from the one to the other.

I didn't prepare that, but God did. The next morning, well, I went to bed that night. Well, shoot, I didn't get much sleep in those days.

The next morning, I woke with the word Joseph in my heart, and I was arguing with the Lord all the way down to the studio. Lord, I said, Joseph is not an end time message. When we got to the studio and I saw the four cameras and the setting and the technicians, my heart within me failed.

And I said, hey, fellas, I'm not one of these Bob Mumford's. I'm just, you know, art cats. Let's pray.

And we went into a little football huddle, and when the prayer ended, there was a still small voice that said Joseph.

So what are you going to do when the red light comes on the camera? But speak Joseph.

And that was the beginning of 14 glorious half hour telecasts without script, without preparation. And we sailed on from glory to glory out of exhaustion, out of enfeeblement, out of despair.

I went to bed that night so whacked out of my skull that I thought I would leave a trail of clothing from the motel door to the bed and take one last leap and hit the light switch as my head hit the pillow and go out. And I did, but I didn't fall asleep. So I punched the pillow and I tried another posture and I didn't fall asleep. And I tried another way. And finally, about two o'clock in the morning, I turned on the light.

I hadn't closed my eyes yet.

I thought, oh, that's what you get for being a Jewish boy and not washing before you go to bed. So I went and I took a hot bath, the kind that you faint when you get out of. Thought I'll collapse in the middle of the room, make it to the bed, hit the light. I made it to the bed and hit the light and my eyes never closed. And finally, about 6.20, it was just pointless. I got up and got dressed. I had to be at the studio at 7.30.

And God performed on that day greater glory than he had performed on the previous day. Out of sleeplessness, out of weakness, out of nothingness, out of barrenness, God brought forth glory. There's a God who delights in bringing light out of darkness, strength out of weakness, fruitfulness out of barrenness, joy out of sorrow, and life out of death.

Have you heard about that God?

He's the God whose Judaism is all inscribed in the symbol of the cross. But men always prefer another kind, much groovier and less demanding and costly. So I want to prepare you for what shall be increasingly end-time deceptions that will counterfeit and seem to simulate light, strength, fruitfulness, joy, and life. But the architects of that counterfeit abhor total dependency upon God. They dislike entombment. They have no stomach for sorrow. They don't enjoy being helpless, but they stress technique, methodology, manipulation, promotion, cleverness, and they measure success numerically and by finances. I think our greatest safeguard always is to cleave to the cross and to remember that holy thing that comes forth out of darkness, out of weakness, out of barrenness, out of sorrow, and out of death. And so God gave me the phrase sitting on your platform tonight, the sacrament of suffering. And I'm not a morbid type, but I want to remind you of a remark made by Basilia Schlink. Many of you have never heard of her. I believe she's a great 20th century oracle of God in Germany who says that one of the greatest calamities of the church is its failure to prepare God's people for suffering.

How do you like them apples, folks?

We may almost are impressed that suffering is some kind of morbid thing which we should flee from at all costs. If we are required to experience some small portion, grit your teeth and see your way through. But how many of us would rush to embrace it and rejoice that we were counted worthy to share his sufferings? Something must be happening to me to make me more freaky than even I have been in times past because something is stirring God within my spirit. Something is stirring God within my spirit to be such a one. Joseph was brought down to Egypt and there he was purchased by an Egyptian officer who had sold him, who had purchased him from Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there. That's what the Scripture says, but who really brought him down there?

God brought him down there.

And how many of us are murmuring about every circumstance which brings us down and looking at the Ishmaelites as if they were the cause? And I can say as a Jew to this day that though we have historically and are presently suffering at the hands of the Ishmaelites, the angry men, our Arab brethren, they are not the cause of our distress, God is. And as I said to Israeli soldiers and young women in the streets of Tel Aviv not too long ago, if you think it an accident that the geography of Israel leaves us helpless, if you think it an accident that there are no great mountain barriers to keep us from our foes, if you think it an accident that even men can come in rubber dinghies and come upon our beaches and go into our communities and shoot us up, you are mistaken. God has established our topography and our geography to make us utterly dependent upon him. It's not terrorists or Arabs or Nazis or anything else that has been the cause of our distress, but a God who brings us down that he might bring us up. It says, but the Lord was with Joseph in the second verse, and he though a slave was successful and prosperous in the house of his master the Egyptian, and his master saw that the Lord was with him, that the Lord made all that he did to flourish and succeed in his hand. So Joseph pleased Potiphar and found favor in his sight, and he served him. I wonder how spiritual that sounds, to serve an Egyptian, and not just admirably, but in an exemplary way, as unto the Lord. I wonder if this is why he found favor in the sight of God, and I wonder how many of us who are having to serve in Egypt are also so laboring. How many of us are cutting corners? How many of us are putting in the bare minimal eight hours in compensation for the wage? How many of us who are in lesser places than this are not showing forth the glory of God in our labor and our service, that even an Egyptian can see that the Lord was with him? How many of you who are waiting for your day of ministry have failed to recognize that you're in it now, at the gas station and in the office and in the mundane places where you're working and making a living, waiting for the days of glory to begin when they should have begun long ago in the ordinary place, that your master might see that the Lord is with you? And I'll tell you that if you'll not begin there, you need not think that that's going to begin in more serviceable places. Oh, what a Joseph is this! What a son is this! He pleased two fathers eminently. But you know what always follows blessing? No matter what adversity to which God brings a man, and through his grace brings him forth gloriously in that place, and just when he's beginning to taste the joy and the delight of having risen from it comes a greater temptation than the first pit. Because Potiphar had a wife, and though he had left all things in Joseph's charge, it says that after a time his master's wife in the seventh verse cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, come lie with me. I don't know quite how to express this, and this I don't think is just unique to red-blooded Jewish boys. I think it's common to us all that we are going to face a severity of temptation in this hour that would kill us if we could imagine it. How many of you are conscious and aware of the kinds of satanic inspiration that are going on in our culture and our civilization? Have you ever seen anything more fiendish as present fashions for women? Have you realized that the kinds of things which we accept as commonplace would have shocked a generation, a decade or so ago, that women are respectively clothed today with such revelation of their forms that it doesn't take much inspired imagination? And yet it's commonplace in happenstance, and we hardly blink an eyelash, that there seems to be a confluence or coming together of ingenious design and new fabrics to aid it.

And I could just talk about fashion. What shall we say of films? What shall we say of the media? What shall we say of TV? What shall we say of advertising?

What shall we say of the very air that we breathe that is becoming increasingly charged with the spirit of Potiphar's wife? The seductive world, has it ever been groovier? Has it ever been more powerful? Has merchandise ever had a greater power to snare the souls of men than it has now? Has packaging ever been so brilliantly exploited? Have men ever learned to stock their shelves with such acuity and sophistication as they now do in our supermarkets, where they have studied color and sound in such combination that you are virtually a victim when you go in for a mere toothbrush and come out with your shopping basket littered with goods? There's power and extraordinary temptation and devilish ingenuity in everything that is earthly and sensual and worldly, and we're only at a beginning.

Come lie with me.

Can you imagine this woman eat an Egyptian the very symbol of everything that is voluptuous and seductive? Some heavy bosomed dame, gloriously built, palpitating, made up, fragrant, and a Jewish man who has been denied the kinds of things that men take for granted as their right, because he's known nothing but pits and exile from youth on. You know what such a one might be tempted to say?

I got it coming.

I'm only flesh and blood. I'm only human.

How many times have we said that?

For much less a temptation than what Joseph had to suffer in this moment. You say cats use the word suffering liberally. Well, I want to read you Hebrews 2.18. For in that he himself suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted. For in that he himself suffered being tempted.

May I say this?

Temptation is suffering, and any red-blooded boy who can refuse such an invitation as this has got to rush out at the back door of the porch and puke, because every corpuscle and every cell in his body, everything that's flesh is crying for gratification and for delight. To resist such temptation as this is suffering. My last time out, I was in Kansas City at this great charismatic conference, 50,000 charismatics, and I had one message to deliver, and God sat me down in my hotel room on the first day from three o'clock in the afternoon to 11 o'clock at night.

I never got up.

Eight hours of preparation on yellow sheets of legal pad, very unusual procedure for me. I had no intention and I had no strategy, but somehow I had missed eating that day, and the next morning I had no appetite, and finally became clear the Lord wanted me to fast, and so I fasted four days for one message.

That's nothing, but it's amazing how many times I was invited out for dinner in those days. How many friends did I see from Oshkosh and Timbuktu in California? Art, let me take you to dinner, and I was like, no. PTL club had its camera set up in one of the hotel rooms, and I was invited for an interview, and sure enough the first question was, would you like a sandwich? How about coffee and doughnut, and next to lasagna ice cream there's doughnuts.

Temptation is suffering, folks, and how many of us have built up a capacity to endure suffering? What's the threshold of your capacity to endure suffering?

At what point will you break? At what point will you throw in the towel? At what point would you surrender?

It's interesting that it says in the 10th verse, and she spoke to Joseph day after day. You know, we might screw up our courage and purse our lips and grit our teeth, and get by a single temptation, but what are you going to do when it's pushed into your face day after day? This is going to be more than a momentary courage and a momentary resolution. There has got to be something wrought in our character that enables us to endure persistent, claimant, strident, siren, seductive voices like this, or we shall collapse. You know what I could say about such a man?

He's not made in a day.

It may take many going down into Egypt before we're ready for temptations of this proportion. Joseph is an end-time message for this reason only, because in it we have a pattern of what must invariably come to the son who is to be the overcomer at the end of the age. Such men must be brought down not by the hand of the Ishmaelites or by brethren who despise them, but by a God who is preparing them. Are you willing to be such a one? Oh, I know that there are many groovy schools of discipleship in our generation, and in three months they'll fit you for service, and you can go off and save Afghanistan. But we're speaking about a son who spent 13 years in confinements in pits and dungeons and cells. The same number of years that a Paul spent in Arabia, and the same number of years, interestingly enough, that a Richard Wurmbrand spent in communist prison camps. How many have heard of him? For some reason today, I was reminded of something that he spoke in one of his books, Torch It for Christ, I think it is, where he said that he came to a point where he watched men belabor his body as if he were looking disinterestedly upon another, and not himself. His spirit was apart from what was taking place, and he was looking down on men whacking flesh, but he did not feel the sting of their blows. Somehow he had come to a place where his life was no longer lived in his body. How many of us would go pale if someone approached us with a hypodermic needle and the idea of something going to penetrate our flesh?

I haven't forgotten my army experiences when we walked down a corridor, and there were the male nurses with their hypos giving it to us on both arms as we went down a row.

And I remember men with their chests heavy with ribbons from campaigns of every kind, peeling over in a faint, unbearable pain. And I remember the men with their arms peeling over in a faint when they saw the needles poised for their flesh.

Where is your life being lived tonight?

You who are a product of a generation that has so pampered flesh that you cannot believe it. More to do with bodily creature comfort than any generation that has ever preceded it.

Men with their hairdos and their styles.

As I had to tell a brother in ministry who wanted to join me in a trip to Eastern Europe, I cannot take you brother. I love you, you're a dear brother, you're precious, but I cannot take you because if my Eastern European brethren catch one glimpse of your hairdryer, we're finished. In which direction are we moving and how are we preparing ourselves for the eventualities of the end time? I don't think there's any more precious statement than all the scripture. In the response to the temptation, come lie with me, than the answer of Joseph.

Three beautiful words, but he refused. He refused.

And not only we the victims of a civilization that has pampered our flesh, but the same civilization whose sociologists have told us that we can't help it. That we're victims of society.

For 34 years I believed that I couldn't help it.

I was the product of my environment. I couldn't help but be a communist or a seducer or whatever else that I was until there came a stark moment in Jerusalem 13 years ago when I stood before the God of all creation and I knew that I could not cop out on what was done in the name of Jesus to Jewish people for 2,000 years, the persecution, the forced conversions or any such thing. I knew that the naked and quintessential art cats was being required to say yes or no to God and I could help it.

But he refused.

How are we being prepared to be a people who shall refuse the spirit of Potiphar in our generation?

He did it.

And I think immediately on the heels of that refusal he had to run out and puke.

I like what he said.

See here with me in the house my master has concern about nothing but all this and my care and he is not a greater in this house than I am nor has he kept anything from me except you for you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil and sin against God? How many of us would have thought that this was a great evil? Because we have also been prepared by a civilization that is promiscuous and liberal and makes excuses not to think that such a thing as this would necessarily be a great evil. He considered that this was a great evil against God. Four centuries before God ever thundered from Sinai, thou shalt not commit adultery. How do they know that it was a great evil against God? Four centuries before God gave the commandments when we who are five thousand years on the other side of the Ten Commandments are yet not persuaded it's a great evil. I think it may be because he loved righteousness and hated iniquity. I think it may be that though God had not yet spoken the commandments he knew the God who spoke the commandments and he loved the God of Holiness and he got to know him in a pit in the fellowship of his sufferings. I heard a pastor once speak against sin and something icky was moving in my spirit. It sounded all right but what he was expressing as I thought on it later was his personal was his personal idiosyncratic moral revulsion at certain forms of sin. For him it was a matter of bad taste.

You want to know something?

That guy is going to be set up for a fall because you'll be amazed how quickly Satan can change your taste like that and what you thought was personally repulsive you may come to lick your lips over by the satanic pressures of the evil one in a moment of excruciating choice. Personal revulsion is not the basis for despising sin as evil nor is it the basis that well if we get caught what will the consequences be and how many of us are kept from sin for fear of the consequence but the only thing that will keep a favorite son of God as an instrument of salvation at the end of the age is not moral repulsion or the fear of consequences but that the conviction is how can I do this great evil and sin against God? Do you love him so much and know him so well that you cannot offend against him? I don't think that such a knowledge and such a relationship can be had in any other place less than a pit, a dry pit in a wilderness. She spoke to Joseph day after day and he did not listen to her to lie with her or to be with her and I suppose that the key is he did not listen to her. Do you remember how the the Levites and the priests marked their thumb and their great toe and their ear with the blood of the sacrifice?

Yes.

I want to ask you tonight is the blood of the lamb on your ear. Do you have a sanctified ear that will not listen to the syrupy smooth seductive invitations of Potiphar's wife? He refused to listen to her or to be with her and the first part is the refusal to listen.

Are you keeping your ear?

That when the moment of crisis came and all the wise men of Egypt could not answer out of the dungeon came a Hebrew who was able to give answer because he could hear the wisdom of God by a still small voice because the same ear that refused to hear the world's invitations was kept for the still speakings of God in the moment of crisis. The two things go together. You can't believe how still and how small a voice God has got. I was telling the fellows yesterday in the minister's conference how in the midst of our poverty in the community where God has brought us in northern Minnesota where we have had to endure 50 degree below zero winters pot belly stoves and shortages all kinds of struggles and being thrown together as Jews and Gentiles and having no place to run but caught up together and entombed caught up together and entombed without an out cut off with the past no novelty no diversion just the people of God day in and day out that in the midst of a crisis of need came a five thousand dollar check in the mail oh you should have heard the choruses of hallelujah's oh the rejoicing and the gratitude for God who has seen our distress and has given answer and who heard our cry and the next morning was our fast day and prayer for Israel and as my head was bowed in prayer I thought I heard a still small voice that said send the money to Jerusalem to a certain ministry now purchasing a property I say I thought I heard that's how indistinct and vague that voice was I can almost give you a mathematical formula that you shall be in incapacitated to hear the still small voice of God in crucial moments in direct proportion as you have lent the same ear to hearing the voice of the world and I'll not just stop with ears but I'll continue with eyes because God says who is more deaf nor blind than my servant Israel by what are you living the outward man or the inward man are your judgments and decisions based on what you see and hear fed into your brain for human analysis and computation and decision or you are a man of the spirit who doesn't move by natural reckonings and by natural observations and by things that are seen or heard I don't want to hear about what is the condition of the congregation to which I'm coming when I'm being driven from the airport to the motel I want to come as a dummy entombed with God only and let the Lord speak out of this mouth out of his wisdom to the need of a people that I don't have to see or have to hear about that's how God brought me to a Yugoslavian ministers conference and unbeknownst to me they were at the point of disintegration they had had it they were at each other's throats envy jealousy dispute strife and I didn't know it I didn't speak their language and no one oriented me they thought I was some American hotshot coming to have my photo taken with the Eastern European Saints to be displayed in the newsletter they had seen other such I remember leaving the hotel room for the 10 minutes from the hotel to the place where the meetings were conducted where the windows had to be shut and we had to endure the suffocation and the heat lest the noise of our meeting go out into the street and distress some citizen who would call the police and God on the platform would give the appropriate word line upon line and precept upon precept night after night I can't tell you a greater rejoicing than to be driven to the airport in a little three-cylinder German car about 20 years old jammed in between two husky Yugoslavians with your suitcase and your apparatus and your American brother to have a brother a Yugoslavian brother turn to you and say in the midst of our crisis God sent the living word in 11 years he said I did not see what I saw last night my pastor weeping when they heard out of your mouth God's answer to their situation knowing that you did not know what was their condition who is more blind or deaf than my servant Israel have you got the blood on your ear have you kept your ear from the hearing of the world and open to the still small voice are you willing to err on the side of sending away the answer to your food shortage and your housing need rather than hold it and perhaps miss God in discarding what was indeed his still small voice I know that God is going to call us at the end of the age for the most unusual dealings and use to which any generation has ever been put no man is able going to be able to serve by the numbers for spiritual laws or 40 will not suffice we're going to find ourselves in unconventional situations when all the wise men of Egypt cannot give answer will you hear in that moment the divine wisdom which will bring safety and salvation to many or will your ear be clotted by the groovy sounds that have made it an inadequate apparatus to hear the voice of God children the hour of preparation is now well you know what happens to the virtuous men of God who refuse to lie with her or to hear her it happened about this time that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the men of the house were indoors and she caught him by his garments saying lie with me you know the guy can say then well listen Lord man I've struggled I've withstood this temptation day by day I've refused to hear her or to be near her but look she's got me I've had it what can flesh do now she caught him by his garments but it says that he left his garment in her hand and he fled and got out of the house if you'll not think me too peculiar or too radical I think that at the very end of the age when the smoke clears there's only going to be nakedness of one kind or another there's going to be two classes of men one who really thought themselves devoted to the Lord and who said though all the world deny you yet will I never deny you and thus said they all until one denied him with oaths and cursings and another left his garment in the hand of a man and fled naked away from Jesus we're either going to flee naked away to save our skins or we're going to leave our garments in the hands of the world to indict us because we refuse to submit to their temptations are you willing to be naked for the Lord's sake and knowing that the garment of your integrity is going to be the very thing that shall accuse you and bring you again into another dungeon that's the very garment that she took to her husband said hey look while you were out of the house that Egyptian slave took advantage of me and he tried to accost me and I have his garment to prove it isn't it interesting that the very thing that stands for your fidelity to God is the very thing that shall brand you accused in the eyes of the world and bring you again into another dungeon but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and loving kindness and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison and you remember that in that dungeon he've found two of the servants of the pharaoh one was a butcher I think or a sorry a baker and the other was the cup bearer or the personal servant of the pharaoh and Joseph was able to interpret the dream and he said to these men in three days you're going to be called up out of this place and when you get to the pharaoh's ear let them let him know who it is that interpreted this dream but at the end of the 40th chapter after the pharaoh hanged the chief baker as Joseph had interpreted to them but even after all that the chief butler gave no thought to Joseph but forgot all about him how'd you like to see your last hope crushed your last opportunity to get yourself out of a dungeon destroyed and it says in the beginning of the next chapter after two full years pharaoh dreamed two more years of entombment for Joseph when his last hope had failed have you ever experienced that when you've counted on God and you believe that something was going to work that he was going to help you out of a situation and he brought you to the end of your tether it was beyond all that you could bear and then it did not happen and you had another period that followed after that two full years i wonder if that was a time of murmuring and complaint for Joseph or a knowledge of God in the intimacy and the fellowship of the suffering that was to serve him when the pharaoh himself had a dream i believe that we're going to come to an hour we can see the beginnings of it now drought extraordinary economic conditions in the world and interdependency upon of nations where the failure of one economy shall bring down many imbalance among nations the oil crisis and all of the kinds of factors that have come suddenly in the earth within the last few years inexplicable weather conditions freaky patterns blackouts in great cities that have unleashed riots and destruction and mayhem and mindlessness a kind of an intimation of a pattern of circumstances that shall sweep modern nations i believe that egypt is being readied for collapse and there's not a wise man in all egypt that shall be able to save it no ibm computer nothing in which the world has trusted for its wisdom shall suffice of what good shall the computers be when the cities are darkened and their machines are dead pieces of hulk what a beautiful picture we have in this crisis that came to egypt when none of the wise men of egypt could answer and pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon isn't it interesting when the moment of deliverance comes it comes hastily hastily after languishing ever so long in obscurity and in pits and in dungeons when God's call comes it comes hastily will you be prepared then i had hoped to spend some time this evening at the motel room in last preparation but it did not come we got delayed on the trip up to the mountain didn't even get a chance to get to the motel and just to use the pastor's office and freshen up a bit and look hastily over descriptions when the call of God comes how oftentimes we find ourselves that it comes hastily and your heart beats like a trip hammer and you feel yourself unprepared and brought before the pharaoh and before the urgent need to give answer you know that this moment can be more tempting for joseph than the moments that came through potiphar's wife pharaoh said i understand that you can interpret dreams i've heard it said of you that you can understand the dream and interpret it what an opportunity for a man to save his skin and say well really i suppose that that's true but joseph answered and said it is not in me God will give pharaoh an answer of peace the answer is not in me don't look to me God will give pharaoh an answer here and God did give pharaoh an answer and egypt and subsequently even the brothers of joseph benefited by the answer and a people were saved out of whom was to come the messiah of the world pharaoh said in the 38th verse of the 41st chapter can we find such a man as this a man in whom the spirit of God is what a fantastic tribute to a lowly hebrew slave two beautiful words that come forth in that question can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is God gave not the spirit by measure unto him this is a man tempered at the hand of God who had to suffer injustice being cast off and rejected by his brethren mistreated by his own and having served God and withstood temptation even to suffer new requirements because of his faithfulness to God i don't know that men are made in any lesser way than that and that God will give his spirit without measure to any lesser man than that can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is pharaoh said to joseph for as much as your God has shown you all this there is nobody so discreet and with such understanding and wisdom as you in him is all the fullness of the Godhead bodily we are complete in him who is the head of all principality and power in him are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge when we shall need wisdom from God in the moment of crisis do you think that it shall come as an answer or as a form of crisis do you think that it shall come as an answer or as a formula or as a person Paul the great apostle wise in the learnings of Israel skilled in the law prized student of the rabbi gamaliel counted all those things as done that he might win christ that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of the sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead i want to read that same portion in the amplified that i may actually be found and known as in him not having any righteousness that can be called my own but that which comes through faith into christ the anointed one the right standing with which comes from God by faith for my determined purposes that i may know him that i may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with him perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of his person that i may in the same way come to know the power outflowing from his resurrection which it exerts over believers and that i may so share his sufferings as to be continually transformed in spirit into his likeness even to his death in the hope that i may attain to the resurrection that lifts me out from among the dead even while in the body not that i may now that i have now attained this or i am already made perfect i want to stop right there because i want to suggest that the only thing that's perfect is that which has come out of death by resurrection the only thing that could give answer at a time of crisis is that which is perfect the only thing that is perfect is the resurrected son and those who are joined with him in intimacy and fellowship in the place of suffering in the pit and in the dungeon in the place of unjust accusation being cast off and rejected comes the knowledge of him that gives answer because he is the wisdom that i may know him do you remember the blessings that the patriarch gave over the sons of Israel in the 49th chapter we read the blessing that jacob pronounced over joseph and i'm going to end with that the 22nd verse of the 49th chapter joseph is a fruitful bow it doesn't say anything about what joseph does but joseph is can we find such a man as this i think of God is underlining anything for our attention now it is an emphasis not so much on charisma as character joseph is a fruitful bow a fruitful bow by a well a spring or a fountain whose branches run over the wall skilled archers have bitterly attacked and sorely worried him they have shot at him and persecuted him i don't know why it is but you can count on it if you're fruitful for God you shall experience persecution from men they despised him for his dreams and all the more for the words which he spoke he was hated and rejected of his brethren let us slay him they said but his bow remained strong and steady and rested in the strength that does not fail him for the arms of his hands were made strong and active by the hands of the mighty God of jacob by the name of the shepherd of the rock of Israel whose wisdom was it whose strength was it whose patience was it whose capacity and ability to resist temptation was it whose knowledge of holiness was it his hand was made strong and did not fail him because he was in the hand of the mighty God of jacob by the name of the shepherd the rock of Israel he rested in the strength that does not fail God shall give you answer he said not i joseph is a fruitful bow the man in whom the spirit of God is the one who was brought down to egypt who knows dry pips in a wilderness servitude extreme temptation persecutions and dungeons the calamity of the church basilia sling said is its failure to have prepared God's people for suffering self-denial is suffering denying one's appetite is suffering resisting temptation is suffering unjust accusation is suffering failure of God to bring blessing when you expect it is suffering the disappointed faces of God's people is suffering obedience to God and sending away five thousand dollars that seems to you an answer to your own need is suffering the way of the cross is the way of suffering God delights in bringing light out of darkness strength out of weakness fruitfulness out of barrenness joy out of sorrow life out of death that i might know him in the fellowship of the sufferings being conformed unto his death in the hundred and fifth psalm God refers to joseph it says in the 17th verse he sent a man he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant his feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in chains of iron and it says his soul entered into the iron people i don't understand that something happened some strange alchemy something happened in that place of entombment and imprisonment where a man was cut off at the where a man was cut off at the pass and locked in with God i had a brilliant secretary who was no longer with me she's in germany precious charismatic sister she was a model saint vivacious and lively and talented i could leave home she could take care of the ministry she could take care of correspondence she could take care of my kids what a joy and God called her away to a pietistic narrow liturgical highly strict german community she wears gray clothing she's required to be up 5 30 in the morning she can't enjoy any privacy she's locked in to a liturgical thing where they read their prayers and she can't stand it because she's spontaneous and free and loves all of the exhilaration and freedom to be found in the charismatic realm she said oh she said i can't even get a candy bar and there's no chinese restaurant to run off to she's cut off at the pass and entombed and when i saw that she said you know she said to me she said i feel like someone going through withdrawal if one of the finest saints i know feels that she's going through withdrawal from the spirit of the world because she cannot get a candy bar or run off for a little escapism to a chinese restaurant or some diversion away from the saints and has been locked in what then shall we say he sent the man before them even joseph who was sold for a slave his feet they hurt with feathers confinement is no fun he was laid in chains of iron and his soul entered into the iron or if i could take liberties with God i would say the iron entered into his soul have you got some iron in your soul or when the first wind of temptation blows and the first hot blast the first heaving bosom and wet voluptuous lips that size to you will you crack or will you refuse are you willing to be put into the place where iron can enter into your soul and he stayed in that place until the word came to him the word of the lord that tried and tested him if you think that this is the story of just one ancient hebrew i think that you're mistaken i think it's the picture of the end time overcoming son who is a delight in the sight of the father a beloved son who is despised and rejected of his brothers the son who knows that you may have meant it to me for evil but God intended it for good a man who does not murmur at circumstances but is willing to go into the dry pit brought there not by ishmaelites but by God i don't think that this is any kind of forced treatment i think that God is looking for those who are willing to be an answer and a savior to an age when all of the wise men shall not be able to give answer a fruitful bow that runs over the wall i just left our community and i said to a young jewish brother who had come to us who is debating whether he should remain he's had a half dozen other invitations he's so attractive his rise in God has been meteoric in 10 months he's a flash and a whiz and when he saw our place and how meager it is and that the chill of winter is already in the august air he's ready to go down to florida to complete his discipleship training there i said dear brother we can't offer you much and i don't believe that God is necessarily requiring that you stay but i think that it's but i think that it's up to you i said God has branded that statement in my heart ever since i gave a message in toronto a fearful message and invitation and a jewish woman in the audience who is a tremendous saint told me lady she said lord she said is that for me do i have to respond to that and the lord answered her it's up to you i think that there are a lot of things that are going to be up to us at the end of the age not everybody has a stomach for the fellowship of his sufferings not everybody likes two full years more in the tomb not everybody likes to be a slave cast down into a pit but the such a one is this God shall give answer when the wise men of egypt shall fail so i just like you to bow your head because i think it's up to you to resist temptation is suffering suffering we have not been prepared for suffering and yet i want to ask in the name of Jesus to those who want to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings i can't tell you what kind of pit it is into which God will throw you but i'll tell you that it's going to be dry very dry i can't tell you into what kinds of dungeons you'll be required to come but you'll have two full years i can't tell you when you'll be brought up but when it comes it shall come hastily is there someone in this room who is willing to be a joseph for the end of the age will you raise your hand before God don't raise it lightly it's up to you don't be the man who comes to me who sees me six months later the audience i don't understand what's happening i've lost my job i've been demoted i'm an engineer i'm doing the work of a high school dropout i'm humiliated i'm incompetent i don't understand what's going wrong with me i said brother how long has this been going on ever since i raised my hands your invitation the lord said tell him that i saw his hand raised and i said i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry and all that has been happening has been my answer to his response that he might have no confidence in the flesh joseph's hand was made strong by that one whose hand was upon his God shall give pharaoh answer precious God i ask you to see the hands that are stretched out and to mark them by name and to prepare for them lord God to be men and women shall that shall be able to resist by your grace the powerful seductive spirit of this age men who shall not only be despised of the world but shall be despised also of their brethren for their dreams and all the more for the words that they shall speak who shall not be understood whose treatment shall be different from others who shall be faded from sight and brought to obscure places and hiddenness where you shall meet them that they shall know a God in holiness and love him that they cannot do this great evil against God seal by name every soul that has an hand outstretched blood and put iron in their souls and give them the knowledge of him who is made unto us and wisdom and knowledge men and women in whom the spirit of God is seal them lord and bring them forth in the day of your choosing 13 years later the number of misfortune and sorrow because out of sorrow comes joy out of death comes life out of restriction comes expansion out of self-denial comes glory out of our nothingness your wisdom that many shall be saved out of death by them is our prayer in Jesus holy name
