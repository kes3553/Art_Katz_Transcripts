Israels Final Chastisement - Art Katz

Good morning saints. Shall we say Shabbat Shalom to the Lord? I'm going to make that my prayer.

Because I want to speak to you out of the rest of God.

Because I did not get any practical rest to speak of last night.

So this is a necessity to speak out of his rest. Because we prophetic men are not only called to proclaim something, but to demonstrate something. Not only to give you the challenge of the word, but to demonstrate the means whereby it will be fulfilled.

That's why I am sleepless. That it might demonstrate to you that there is another energy and another power, another life. The one that was raised from the dead. And by which we are called also to live.

We are the people of the resurrection.

And the Jews have no chance. Good intentions will not save them. Only the inexhaustible life of God.

Which is also the unconditional love of God.

You see what the Jews do for us? They compel us to become the church. That we would have been too lazy to have obtained. We would have been content only with success. Good meetings. How was the speaker? Did you like him? You are the center of every consideration. Did you like him? Did you enjoy the service? We are the center of our own consideration. It's called egocentrism.

And we are as guilty of it in the church as those that are in the world.

Only one thing can save us from its power. The cross laid to the root. The axe. And a greater motive than our own enjoyment.

The glory of God.

Forever. As we say in Yiddish. Mamma Mia! I am beside myself. For your sake and for the Lord's sake. I had not a thought to speak any of the things that I have already mentioned. But my life is not my own. My thoughts are not my own. My life is not my own. One more mistake and she's out. Okay, I'm sorry. Don't look at this.

Every morning I ask the Lord for his thoughts which are above my thoughts. He waits only to be asked.

Because his thoughts are so much greater. And his ways also. So Lord we say Shabbat Shalom to you.

The great God who has given us peace. The Shalom that is more than the absence of conflict.

It's something positive and given. The rest of God. Which we labor to enter. Lest we fall short of the rest. As was Israel's mistake.

So Lord let your labor, your work today proceed out of your rest.

I'll tell you how ambitious I am Lord. For more than a message. However much I love messages. I'm asking more than a message. A work. Even a work that was established before the foundations of the earth were laid. Let it be fulfilled this morning. By the inexhaustible power of your life. Full of consequence for the church. And the people of Israel. Even the issue of life or death. Eternity itself. Who is sufficient for these things.

So show yourself strong Lord.

Take us by surprise. Beyond our expectation. That we will be privileged participants in an act of history. An event. Given in Holland. On Saturday morning, April 22nd. But it will resonate to eternity.

And it will have consequence for all nations.

And I'm not ashamed to ask this. One because the time is short. The issues are great. And nothing is too difficult for you. And nothing is impossible for you.

And God's people say Amen.

Well. Would you turn to Isaiah 53?

So the Lord brought Philip up to the chariot in which the Ethiopian eunuch was reading from the scroll of Isaiah. And the Lord brought Philip up to the place where the Ethiopian eunuch was reading from the scroll of Isaiah.

And what does the prophet speak about? About himself or another. So Philip joined himself to his chariot.

And shared with him the things pertaining to Jesus. There's been a controversy between Judaism and Christianity as to the interpretation of this text.

I showed this text to my Jewish mother. She had never heard of it. Who is faithful in her synagogue attendance. And she said where in the New Testament is this found? I said it's an Old Testament prophet. Why then she said did I not hear it in the Haftorah readings on the Shabbat mornings? I said you never will. It is omitted from the synagogue. You know what the Haftorah is? That's the reading out of the prophets. Selected by the rabbis.

In keeping with the selection out of the five books of Moses.

And this text is studiously avoided. It is too evidently Christological.

But the oldest rabbinical comments said it describes the messiah. But all theology points out that this speaks about the messiah.

Until Rabbi Rashi. Who was reacting to Christian controversy. Who gave it another interpretation. This speaks of suffering Israel. It describes the nation's suffering. Although we can see from many places in the text. He was wounded for our transgressions. Speaks of another than the nation. And yet this morning. I'm going to take my inspiration from Rashi. And say that there is an application also. That is yet future for Israel. Because I believe in the view of Israel's call. Like its Lord. To be a suffering servant. It must walk this road to Calvary. When you read the text carefully. There are three voices.

One is the prophet who is the commentator, the narrator.

In one place it's God himself speaking directly. And in yet another place. It seems to be a people coming to a certain recognition. That is breaking upon their consciousness for the first time. That he was stricken for the transgression of my people. That all we like sheep have gone astray. We have all turned to our own way.

And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

So here is what I am suspecting. The Jacob's trouble of which I spoke last night. Which will not be confined to Jews in Israel only. But wherever Jacob is to be found in the world. Though surely there to be found in Israel.

For Israel more rightly ought to be called Jacob than Israel. Because it has not yet encountered the Lord.

And received his indelible mark in its thigh. That would make it to be lame all the days of its life.

And recognize that the Lord is its strength.

For it has been made weak in the very nexus of its humanity. In the joint here. Where I understand the blood cell itself is formed. Where the cowboys keep their six shooters. And the modern day businessmen their cell phones. We like to have something on our hip. It's very macho, masculine. Gives us a sense of power. That's why God must touch that place especially. And cripple us. And then our name can be changed. From Jacob to Israel. Then we'll build an altar in his name.

And sacrifice to the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac. The God of Israel also.

That encounter is coming. There'll be a night of wrestling. With the man. When we have sent everything over. All our Jewish confidences. In the Gods of this world. Intellect. Our own ability. Technology. Culture. Send everything over. And then he'll meet with us. And we'll not let him go until he blesses us. Because only as Israel.

Can we bless all the families of the earth.

And never as Jacob. However much Jacob is attractive to you. There must be a road to Calvary. You see the way the prophetic mind works.

It brings together certain texts.

Isaiah 53. Marred more than any man. He has no beauty that any should desire him. Someone who is just ground to powder. Robbed of all human dignity. An outcast. Despised and rejected of men.

Was the Messiah's experience.

But will also be the experience of Israel. When they will become the least of these his brethren. Steven Spielberg. The great movie producer. With his billion dollar dream factory. We Jews are entertaining the world. With fantasy. And unreality.

Who have called to be a light to the nations.

Will find himself somewhere in northern Minnesota. Or some remote place in Holland. Or Africa. In some dirt road. With nothing more than the stinking shirt on his back. Broken and dejected. Suddenly uprooted. Everything lost. Despised of men. Hated. Beaten. Marred. That's how they will come to us. The least of these his brethren. This text really begins in chapter 52.

From verse 13, see my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up he shall be very high.

Just as there were many who were astonished at him, so maud was his appearance beyond any human form. And his form beyond that of mortals of men. I just want to change one pronoun. From he to they.

So shall they startle many nations.

King shall shut their mouths because of them. For that which had not been told them they shall see. And that which they had not heard they shall observe.

When they see the sufferings of Jesus reiterated in his people.

King shall shut their mouths. Because of them. And what mankind had not recognized two thousand years ago. And have dismissed from their consideration. Or made it an Easter egg and chocolate bunny thing. Or made it an Easter egg and chocolate bunny thing.

God will again demonstrate.

The profound meaning of that suffering.

For the consideration of all nations.

Through another servant's son. Israel. In its last days sufferings. They will have no form or majesty that anyone should look at them. Nothing that there appears that anyone should desire them. They will be more despised and rejected by men. A people of suffering acquainted with infirmity. As one from whom others will hide their faces. When did we see you naked and thirsty and hungry and imprisoned? When did we see you hungry and naked and imprisoned? And they hide their faces. From an afflicted Israel. Because there is no beauty that you should desire them. The romantic aura that you now so much appreciate. The heroic way in which you like to envision them. The heroic way in which you want to mark them. That will be lost. And you will see them reduced. Without any beauty that you should desire them. And you will not desire them. In verse 4 the voice changes. Someone else is now speaking. Someone upon whom a new realization has come. Out of the kindred experience of that kind of suffering. It opens a new vista, a new way of perceiving. There is something about suffering that reveals things as they in fact are. That's why we are going to pass through the wilderness of the nations. Have you ever been lost in one? Is there one in Holland to be found? Where you will find yourself lost? Terrified? Alone? In the dark? Fearful circumstances? Stripped of everything? Reduced from all the amenities of life? Face to face with ultimate reality? Man and God. What is it about? There is a reason for this wilderness. Is to reduce men. And to strip them from all their categories. That they might be confronted with the God that we have so long been avoiding. Even in our orthodoxy. Something in that time. And in those circumstances. In the suffering of those days.

The scriptures say about three and a half year period of time. Will give Jews ample opportunity to reflect.

On the meaning of our existence. And why we have so suddenly experienced this. Again. Another dispersion. Cast out. Rejected. Suddenly. Imagine them saying from verse four.

Surely he had borne our infirmities and carried our diseases. Yet we had accounted him stricken struck down by God and afflicted.

We had practiced revisionism on Jesus. The kind that is being practiced today. In the same way we have looked at Jesus. As we are now looking at the Holocaust. At this moment there is a process going on in London, England. About the critical consideration of his historians. Who do not see the reputation. Because he has a book and there is a process against this man, this historian. Because he has been critically exposed to the Holocaust. And because he has said that it was extremely exaggerated. That the people who died count that it is exaggerated. And that it is politically abused to eventually destroy the state of Israel. The historicity of the Holocaust. One of the most documented and detailed events in time men want to dismiss as not having taken place. And the Jewish community is outraged. After all they have spent millions on museums. Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. And the Holocaust Memorial in Washington DC. They want to keep the memory alive. And there are men saying it did not take place. And we call that revisionism. What the people say he will also reap.

And we have also done that with the crucifixion of Jesus.

Men have denied that it took place. It did not come into our Jewish consideration. It was not convenient that it should. And now we are suffering the same upon our own Holocaust. We dismissed his Holocaust. Men are dismissing our Holocaust. But his Holocaust is not something that you want to dismiss. Because suffering reveals.

And nothing has revealed God more profoundly than the cross. The righteousness of God is revealed at the cross. The mercy of God is revealed at the cross. The son of God is revealed at the cross.

And the father to whom he cries.

And the giving up of his Holy Spirit. All three persons of the Godhead. Are profoundly manifested in the crucifixion of Jesus. And to dismiss that is to dismiss God.

As God. Or you can talk about the monotheistic God. But the God who is monotheistic is not God. It's a Jewish construct. It's a God of convenience. But it's not the God who is God. Demonstrated at the cross. Profoundly as in no other place. So the misstatus to miss everything. That's why we have ourselves to experience his suffering. Are you keeping eternity in view? We have a millennial destiny. That goes beyond history. It will be an everlasting call.

The gifts and callings of God are irrevocable.

They cannot be taken back. God is not fitting us for some short term assignment.

But that which is eternal.

And for that he will invest and require much. You do err. In your consideration of Israel. Because you have only considered Israel in the context of time. But you have not considered Israel in the context of eternity. This is not too extravagant. To require this suffering. This is not some arbitrary God. Deciding to be mean. This is a judgment. This is a judgment. It was for Jesus.

That was the righteousness of God.

Paying for the sin of mankind.

Because man could not himself pay it.

Only God could. And suffer the judgment.

That a righteous God must require.

Our road to Calvary. Our suffering. Our time of Jacob's trouble. The past holocaust. The future holocaust. In exact proportion to our sin. To a people who have no concept of sin.

Because sin by its nature disguises itself as sin.

And only the magnitude of judgment reveals it. Do you want to know how great our Jewish sin is? And the sins of our fathers. Which are our sins also.

Because we have never severed ourselves from their sins. Our silence condemns us to their rejection of Jesus.

And makes it our rejection also. It's not God penalizing us because we missed it in one historic moment.

The rejection of Jesus is the sum total of all our moments.

It reveals the truth of our apostasy. It is our failure to recognize him. To hear the father in his speaking. To see the father in his countenance. Because we did not know God. Nor could we recognize his son. We were too long apostate. Even in the continuation of our religious practices.

The rejection and the crucifixion of Jesus is not some momentary lapse.

It's the statement of our long standing and historic apostasy. It is the sum of all the time we have spent. And ultimately in this historic moment. If you do not believe that I am here. You shall die in your sins. No man spoke as this man spoke. And to consent to the decision of our fathers. And to make it our own decision.

That's why God says when you will confess the iniquity of your fathers.

And of your own. Then I will remember my covenant to it here. We are implicated. With our whole history and past.

Sins that we have not so much as acknowledged.

Let alone made any attempt to repent. And what does God do in his mercy? He sends preliminaries. The destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. A great catastrophe. That Jews could not believe could happen. And disperse again into the nations. And there to suffer in every nation where we have been cast. Where the Passover season was a time already of fright. Because it will be followed by Easter. And the cry of Christ killer. And the ravaging of our communities. And the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. And the ravaging of our communities. And the ravaging of our communities. So that blood would flow through the streets of every German hamlet. So that the Jewish blood flowed in all these ghettos.

God's judgments are not cruel. And God's judgments are not free.

They are calculated to bring us to an awareness. Of those things which we would not otherwise have considered. Why do we continue to suffer? Why does God permit it? Have we offended against him? Is there some sin for which he holds us accountable? The question is not so much as asked. And so there will be a final suffering. In which I believe the question will be asked. Maybe we made a mistake in rejecting that one who suffered 2000 years ago. Was he suffering for himself? Was it his own sin and his own transgression? Who said to his accusers, which of you can convict me of sin? He was a lamb without spot and without blemish. Verse four.

Surely he had borne our infirmities, 53-4.

And carried out diseases.

But we thought of him as being stricken and struck down by God and afflicted.

But now we're willing to reconsider. And now we have to come back to that. Maybe he was wounded for our transgressions. Maybe he was crushed for our iniquities. And maybe with his stripes we were made whole. And he's healed our bruises. And he's healed our bruises. Because all we like sheep have gone astray. We have all turned to our own way.

And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed and he was afflicted, but he didn't open his mouth. He went like a lamb to the slaughter, like a sheep before his shearers is silent, he did not open his mouth. But we, full of complaint, full of murmurs, full of indignation. How come? Why? Where? But he, as a lamb to the slaughter, silently.

He was cut out and off from the land of the living, in verse 8.

Stricken for the transgression of his people. Although he had done no violence. And unlike us, there was no deceit in his mouth. Suffering reveals. And absolute suffering will reveal absolutely.

Where we have not learned from the word, we will have to learn from the experience of our own suffering.

It's a chastisement of God. It will break us as a nation. In a brokenness that will never heal. It will be a perpetual disfigurement. That we cannot again be a Jacob people. Grasping. Grasping the land. Rather than inheriting it. We will be another people.

And we will bless all the families of the earth.

In my Holocaust book I speak of this chastisement. Of a kind for which a father does not spare his son. Not the kind of fathers that we are. Who are condescending. Look the other way. Avoid encounter. We don't want to be cruel. We don't want to threaten the affection of our children for ourselves. And so they go wild. Because they have not experienced the kind of love that can only come through chastisement. We don't love them enough to punish them. When they deserve it. And their spirits intuit that. So they put nose rings in their tongue and in their belly button and tattoo themselves. And have all kinds of piercings. And they live a life of rebellion. Against the generation that has not loved them enough. To chastise them. But God is not a man. His love chastises.

And in all our affliction he is afflicted.

He is not looking down from some ethereal height. Indifferent and untouched.

In all our afflictions he is afflicted. But he does not withhold the affliction.

Because an eternal destiny is at stake. So in the book I quote from another author.

Who describes Israel as the chastised son.

Cruelly dealt with. Recognising that in that chastisement.

Is the righteousness of God. Is the righteousness of God.

For our own good. And the father is weeping. At the necessity to have to afflict it. And something happens in that moment. Between an afflicted son and an afflicting father. A bond of love. Of an ultimate kind. That shall never be broken.

The knowledge of God.

In the depth of his father's love.

That Israel will communicate to all nations.

For all posterity. Because its knowledge will not be Talmudic or academic. But it shall be a realistic knowledge. A knowledge through suffering. If you don't understand this. You are going to be offended by God. Where is he? To allow this to happen a second time in the 20th century? Haven't they suffered enough? What about his promises? Haven't they suffered enough? Where are the promises? The scriptures can't be trusted. And where is God's kindness? Rightly did Paul say. One of the great signs of the end of the age. Is the great falling away of the church. In disappointment. At a failed Israel. A failed rapture. A failing God. A failing recording. Because they didn't understand.

The central principle of God. The essence of God's principle.

Intrinsic to all reality. There is a must and an ought. That the Messiah must suffer. Servant sons must suffer. Before they ascend to their glory. Before they ascend to their glory.

So to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

Who has believed this report? Who has believed this report? Who has believed this testimony? Those who have understood the centrality of suffering. Those who have understood suffering. As being intrinsic to sainthood. As being intrinsic to sainthood. The very thing that we have shunned. The very thing that we avoid. The very thing for which we carefully defend ourselves. The very thing for which we have defended ourselves.

Is the very thing given of God.

To bring us to sainthood. To Christlikeness. To sonship. And as we will not receive suffering for ourselves. And as we will not receive suffering for ourselves. And carefully insulate ourselves from it. We don't want it to fall on Israel either. We don't want it to fall on Israel either.

And the arm of the Lord will not be revealed. We need to recognize that in God's sopherest chastisement. We need to recognize that in God's sopherest chastisement. Is God's greatest love.

What you've never experienced? Have you never experienced the chastisement of God? Have you never experienced the chastisement of God? What are you then illegitimate? That he's passed you by? Or you did not desire to become a son? When Jesus said, who do men say that I am?

Peter said, thou art the Messiah. The son of the living God. From that time forth, from that time, Jesus began to tell them that he had to go to Jerusalem.

He had to suffer. He had to die.

In the moment that the recognition of himself as son was the recognition of the necessity for suffering.

Because there is no sonship without suffering. There is no sonship without suffering. What will cure us from this humanistic mentality? Lord, let us be far from you. What will cure us from this humanistic mentality? Let it be far from us. This deep humanism that the world applauds. That the world applauds. It seems so honorific. It seems so wonderful. So kind and condescending. So loving and so tolerable. But it stank from satan. But it stank from satan. What is going to break the power of this in our life? That makes us polite. A polite society.

And renders us non-apostolic.

Approved by the world. But offensive to God. And will never recognize his purposes. And will always be offended by them. Because we celebrate what is nice. Lord, let us be far from Israel. It is the same kind of sentiment. And the only thing that will break its power.

It will break the power of God.

No, the only thing that will break this power of softness is the power of God. And the power of suffering.

By which we become the sons of God.

And dear people. If you can understand this.

Except we become the sons and daughters of God.

How shall we comfort Israel? In a final affliction.

God says I will meet with you face to face.

In the wilderness of the nations.

And there you will come into the covenant.

And there I will receive a revelation.

Of who I am as God.

In mercy that is given unstintingly. In a love that is unconditional. And that cannot be offended against. Even when you are rude and ungrateful.

God will still reveal his face to you.

By sons and daughters. Whose life is in him. And not in their humanistic assumptions. And the values of the world. That is nice. Let this be far from you. Let this be far from you. Israel's suffering is calculated for us. It's a crisis that requires us to become the church.

Because God will not speak to the dry bones.

Only a son of man. A son of man.

And a son of God.

Who can be commanded.

And prophesy to those bones.

In a faith that works by love. And not well meaning intention.

Only a word of resurrection can raise the dead.

And if we are not in that prophetic sonship place. We can say every kind of well meaning thing. Those bones will not live. It's going to take a resurrection word. It will be a resurrection power. A resurrection authority.

By a people of the resurrection.

Who have suffered multiple deaths. That they might know him. In the power of his resurrection. And make him known. Resurrection is more than a doctrine to approve. It's a reality to obtain. Have you done it? Consistent? Why should you? What requirement do you have? A Sunday service? A conference? You can do that in your own humanity. Tell me one time in all your Christian years.

Where you had to pray as I have prayed this morning.

Because I had only three hours sleep. And know the magnitude of what was before me this morning. A work that is going far beyond you. That I have to say again and again. Who is sufficient for these things? Is yours a Christianity that requires you to say that? Continually? Or are you living outside of it?

And beneath the glory of God.

Christianity has become a culture. Whether it's practiced on Sunday. Or Saturday. A culture. And it's leaving the Jewish community totally unimpressed. And it's leaving the Jewish community totally unimpressed. And it's leaving the Jewish community totally unimpressed. And it's leaving the Jewish community totally unimpressed. We are not moved to jealousy. We are not moved to jealousy. Perhaps to contempt. Perhaps to contempt. That we do it as nonsense. That we do it as nonsense. You have to do a heathen. It's something that is far beyond their idea. Even the imitation of their culture will not impress them. Even the imitation of their own culture will not impress them. Only heaven. And the reality of heaven. By the people who have created it. Against the price. And maintain it consistently. Are you beginning to understand the mystery? Are you beginning to understand the mystery? Of Israel and the church? How we are locked in with this people. How we are locked in with this people. In the genius of God. That they without us cannot obtain to their calling. They without us. Can never obtain to their calling. Nor we without them. They compel us to be the church.

Of an apostolic and a resurrection kind. Of an apostolic and a resurrection kind.

Where nothing less will impress them. Where nothing less will impress them. In the ultimate crisis of their last days. In the ultimate crisis of their last days. I'm speaking to you out of resurrection power in life. I'm speaking to you out of resurrection power in life. Not human ability. Because God is wanting to impress upon you. Because God is wanting to impress upon you.

That the means by which this message has come. That the means by which this message has come. Is the means by which it shall be fulfilled.

By a people who can say in truth. By a people who can say in truth. By a people who can say in truth.

For me to live is Christ. For me to live is Christ. My life is my Christ.

Israel did not recognize Jesus. Israel did not recognize Jesus. Israel could not appreciate Jesus' suffering. Israel could not appreciate Jesus' suffering. Israel couldn't recognize Jesus. Israel could not appreciate Jesus' sufferings. Israel couldn't understand Jesus' suffering.

Israel had a human anticipation of what a messiah should be. They had a human anticipation of what a messiah should be.

A military hero? A military hero?

Who will overcome Rome and restore the glory of Israel.

And we, the church, desire the same for present Israel. We desire the same for present Israel. A heroic nation. With the Antebi exploits. With the Antebi exploits. Hit squad ability. With the Antebi exploits. With the Antebi exploits. We love it. We love it as Christians. We idealize them. We idealize them. In their humanity. I want to see them to succeed in that. We want to see them to succeed in that. We want to see them to succeed in that. We've come full circle. We've come full circle. And we don't understand. And we don't understand. That the issue is not the success of a nation state. That the issue is not the success of a nation state.

But the glory of God forever. But the glory of God forever.

There's something greater than Israel. There's something greater than the church. It's that for which both the church and Israel have been given. It's that for which both the church and Israel have been given. To reveal and to establish. To reveal and to establish.

The glory of God forever. The glory of God forever.

Amen. Amen. If we have any motive that is less than that. If we have any motive that is less than that. There'll be no room in our heart for suffering. There'll be no room in our heart for suffering. We will not understand it. We will be offended by it. We will be offended by it. We will be offended by it.

But the prophets of old. But the prophets of old.

They searched for what man of time.

The spirit of Christ that was in them.

They searched for what man of time.

The spirit of Christ that was in them. Did prophesy. Concerning the sufferings of Christ. To reveal what these texts were meant by. The guidance of Christ.

And the glory that would follow. And the glory that would follow. Who wrote that? Peter. The one who betrayed Christ. The one who betrayed Christ.

Three times before the end of Christ. Three times before the end of Christ.

He said that after. And the girl spoke that after. And the girl spoke that after. And the girl spoke that after. Ought not Christ to have suffered.

And then enter his glory, Jesus said.

Ought not Christ to have suffered.

And then enter his glory, Jesus said.

There is a must and an ought. There is a must and an ought. For the nation as a son. For the nation as a son.

As well as the initial son of God himself. As well as the initial son of God himself.

And what about us? Jesus Christ. How does the church fit into this pattern? How does the church fit into this pattern? What kind of requirement is there for us with suffering? What kind of requirement is there for us with suffering? Only to the degree that we are identified with Israel. Only to the degree that we are identified with Israel. Not sentimentally. Not sentimentally. Not sentimentally. Not sentimentally. That will fail us. That will fail us. But in truth. But in truth.

As ourselves being the Israel of God with them. As ourselves being the Israel of God with them.

If they are the least of his brethren. If they are the least of his brethren. What are they to us? What are they to us? If not also our brethren. Our brethren. Even in their sin. Even in their apostasy. Even in their apasity. Even in their shame. Even in their judgement. Even the final judgement that is on them. When is the set time to favor Zion come? When is the set time to favor Zion come? When is the set time to favor Zion come? When is the set time to favor Zion come? Psalm 102 tells us. When my servants have mercy on her stones and compassion on her dust. God is waiting for something, not in Israel. In the church. An identification with this people. The church and identification with this people. Beyond sentiment. Beyond romantic imagining. Beyond the idealizing of their supposed heroism. Not when they are at their best. When they are at their worst. When they are the least of his brethren.

God waits for your identification.

When all the world will despise them. You will have compassion upon her stones and mercy upon her dust. The stones and dust of what? Not antiquity. God is not talking about archeology. He is talking about Tiberias. Haifa. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Modern Israel. Reduced to stubble, stone and dust.

In the judgment of God that must come.

That will not offend you. That you will identify with them. Even when the judgment is in proportion to their sins. The sad time to favor Zion has come. The church is not looking down from some superior height. Nor out of some sentimental adulation. But as being one with this people. After all you are grafted into their root.

You are the Israel of God.

And you are not going to be conveniently spared. In the time of their tribulation. You will have tribulation also. Perhaps even for their sake. Your very identification with them. Will put you in the place of peril. And of suffering. Will the real church please stand up? You know this American television program? Will the real person stand up? Yes, who of the three? There are four candidates. They all look like a possibility.

But only one is the true.

Will the true church please stand up? The response to Israel will reveal it. In the time of her Jacob's trouble. It's beyond sentiment. The church's hope must be Israel's hope. The hope of the church will be equal to the hope of Israel. Paul says I'm in these chains for the hope of Israel.

The blessed hope of which Paul spoke is not a rapture.

A convenient escape.

That has never been the apostolic hope of the church.

But the hope of his coming. Of his kingdom. Of his rule and reign. And of our reward with him.

Who have suffered for his namesake. Is a hope that blesses. That is the hope that brings blessings.

Thank you. Do you desire sonship? Yes. This is ultimate. This is more than charismatic. This is more than messianism.

This is the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. To be a son is to be a priest. And to be a priest is to identify.

With people in their infirmity. In their weakness. In their brokenness. In their weakness. Sons suffer to obtain sonship. Sons suffer to become sons.

And it says of Jesus though he was a son. And Jesus said although he was a son.

He suffered in learning obedience. So also for us.

He is going to bring many sons to glory.

And this is what has not yet been revealed to Israel. Sons in his image. Reflecting his character. His very nature. That is beyond the truisms and the sentimental categories of the world. And those sentimental things will keep us from the attainment of the sonship. It's not your defects that need to be brought to the cross. It's your virtue. It's your being a nice guy. It's having an affair with your father. It's having an affinity for Israel. Going to plant trees and going to conferences. This is the very impediment. To the obtainment of his life. Because you value what is of man.

And not what is of God.

You are unwilling to suffer. You don't want to be misunderstood. You don't want to offend Jews. Though we bear a message. That by its very nature. Is an inescapable offense. Excuse me. What does it say in Isaiah? Don't withhold your voice. Like a trumpet. Tell Jacob their transgressions. And Israel their sins. Don't tell them that they are as Christian as any Christian you know. That's the last thing that they need to hear. It reinforces them in their error. They need to be made conscious of this. By those who can confront. And not withhold. And suffer their indignation. Their anger. Their rejection. Their rejection. Though it be very love. Sentiment spares. Love confronts. You'll be eternally ashamed. For being a nice guy.

And having fallen short of the glory of God.

Where are the reproaches of Christ? That we should be bearing. And don't experience.

We sent a place for Elijah at the Passover table. And we sent a young son to the door to open if he might come in.

As I said to my brother. I think he may already be with us. And already seated at the table. A wilderness prophet. And we've not recognized him. Who is proclaiming the way.

For the full coming of the Lord.

Who is pent up in the heavens.

Waiting for the restoration of all things spoken by the prophets.

Since the world began. The restoration of Israel. After a last days affliction. I will return them. And they will rebuild the cities that have been made waste and ruined. And I will dwell with them.

And I shall be their God, they shall be my people.

The climax of the age. That does not wait upon Israel. Israel will be helpless. Unable in any way to affect her own redemption. When the Lord appears in Jerusalem after two thirds of Israel has been destroyed. When the Lord appears in Jerusalem after two thirds of Israel has been destroyed. And half the city sent into exile. And the women ravaged and raped.

The Lord will come.

And they shall see him whom they have pierced. And mourn for him as one mourns for one's only son.

And the world will see the greatest national repentance in the history of mankind.

Every family apart. Husbands and wives apart.

We shall be prostrate before God.

Utterly shattered. At the revelation of him. The coming has saved us. We shall look upon him whom we have pierced. But the depth of that broken repentance. Is not even for us to perform. Lest we should one day boast in it. That we Jews have a special capacity toward God. That we Jews have a special capacity toward God. He will not even grant us that. He will not even grant us that.

Repentance is the gift of God. And if he does not pour on the city of Jerusalem the spirit of supplication and of prayer. And if he does not pour on the city of Jerusalem the spirit of supplication and of prayer.

There will be no repentance at all.

God is all in all.

In us is no good thing at all.

And Israel will not bless all the families of the earth. And Israel will not bless all the families of the earth.

Until it knows it. Until it knows it. Until it knows it. Even in its own repentance.

It's the gift of God.

God is not waiting for anything from Israel. They will be dry bones. Without hope cut off.

It's what shall be performed upon them and for them.

From another. That is the issue of Israel's restoration.

A son of man who can prophesy. A son of man who can prophesy.

In resurrection power. In the power of resurrection. That those bones can live. A servant people who can have compassion and pity for the ruins of Israel in her judgment. A servant people who can have compassion and pity for the ruins of Israel in her judgment. A servant people who have moved for Israel. God is sending the Elijah ministry. God is sending the Elijah ministry.

The prophets from the wilderness.

Who are not recognized by the establishment. To prepare the way.

For the full coming of the body of Christ.

For when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. For when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.

All Israel shall be saved as it is written. All Israel shall be saved as it is written.

Israel's restoration is the issue of the church. That has come to fullness. That has put away all of it's immaturities. All it's cute programs. It's Yiddish-kite and it's culture. It's Yiddish-kite and it's culture.

And it's deep into the root of God. Drawing it's life out of that divine sap. For it's compassion is the compassion of God. And it's mercy is the mercy of God.

Beyond anything religious. Beyond anything religious. That we can perform. That he might be all in all.

This is what it means to pray for the peace of Jerusalem.

Not a little cheap momentary afterthought. Not a little cheap momentary afterthought.

To pray for the peace of Jerusalem is to pray for the judgment of God that must come. To pray for the peace of Jerusalem is to pray for the judgment of God that must come.

The suffering that must come. The suffering that must come. That proceeds their restoration. So you know what my prayer was before we left Minnesota?

It needs to be all our prayer. It should be all our prayer.

Lord, keep me from being a superficial expresser of truths. Lord, keep me from being a superficial expresser of truths. Make me the thing in itself. Make me the thing in itself. The reality that you're wanting for the church. In the fullness that will release Israel. In the fullness that will release Israel. Our speaking will come out of our being. A sonship that we cannot obtain independent of each other. A sonship that we cannot obtain independent of each other. By which we preserve carefully our privacy. By which we preserve carefully our privacy. And our dignity. But a church that has become community. Going from house to house daily breaking bread. Seeing ourselves as we really are. Confessing our sins. To find release only from a brother to whom a confession can be made. To find release only from a brother to whom a confession can be made. Everything which we have feared. And want to protect in our privacy. That condemns us to Sunday culture. Or it's Saturday equivalent.

Keeps the Lord contained in the heavens.

Waiting for the restoration of all things. Waiting for the restoration of all things.

Spoken by the prophets.

The issue of Israel's return is the issue of the church. But a church of what kind? An ultimate kind. Found at the cross. That has surrendered to the inescapable truth. Found at the cross. That in this life there's a must and an ought. Of a suffering that is intrinsic to the faith. Of a suffering that is intrinsic to the faith. And proceeds to glory.

Help us to that Lord.

To surrender to that. For Israel's sake. For your name's sake.

For your glory.

Let's pray for such a church. In every nation. And in this nation. Thank you Lord. Precious God. Oh the depth of the riches.

Both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.

Who has been his counselor. And who shall give to him that it shall be given again. For of him. And through him. And to him. Are all things.

To whom be glory forever. To whom be glory forever.

Lord I ask. That this word this morning. Constitute a work. An event. Whose time has come. To pierce our hearts. To give us a jealousy for your glory. That exceeds our affection for Israel. Thank you for your life. This is beyond us. Who can attain to this? Who is sufficient for this? But we thank you. Something was wrong. Something was wrought at the cross. More than the forgiveness of sins. But an exchanged life. The ultimate good news.

That as many as have been baptized into Jesus Christ.

Have been buried with him. Sentiment in all. Sentiment in all. And raised with him. Through the newness of life. That serves God. Exclusively. Oh we thank you Lord.

Grant us the grace.

And the faith. To appropriate that reality.

By virtue of our baptism.

As being more than getting wet. More than a religious obligation. But a burial. Of that which will always contradict you. That will always say the wrong thing at the wrong moment. Will always say let this be far from you Lord. Crucify it. And bury it. That we might be raised to a newness of life. That knows that it knows. That there is an Israel that must suffer. That there is a church that must suffer. Before it ascends to its glory. And counts it all joy to do so. Thank you my God. Oh work a work. And raise us from the dead. Wake us from our sleep. Lift us from our dry bones condition.

Breathe the spirit of your life into us.

That we might be for them what we ought. So that we may experience it first and then let them see it. And that is the purpose of our being. This is the reason for our salvation. That you might be glorified forever.

In the name of Jesus we pray.

Amen.
