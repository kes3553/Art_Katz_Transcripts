The Church and the Synagogue 3 of 4 - Art Katz

Well, I think there's a little bit of, when you're gleaning, that's the word, that needs to take place before we break up into those committees, and I just want to shift the two out of the book from which we started yesterday to make sure we're getting the principal points of consideration of this writer, and that that will factor into our discussions and make them all the more rich. He says that even the house gatherings that took place in Rome took place under the authority of the synagogue as there was yet no separation of church and synagogue for Paul or for those he addressed in Romans. So the church is yet to be formed as we have come to know it, and so the likeliest and most reasonable place for fellowship for a Gentile believer would be in the synagogue, and that evidently the synagogue scholars have discovered took these, whatever house fellowship there was under their supervision, and I'm writing in the margin, ought there ever to be a separation between the Christian believing community and the Jewish community or synagogue? Is Rome the great example of a pattern that God has established from the beginning or just the kind of exigency, the kind of thing that was born out of expediency?

Maybe both.

Just like the book of Romans is something born out of expediency itself.

What's the expediency?

The questions raised by the Church of Rome for Paul as how to consider the issue of Israel after their fall.

Are we now the new Israel of God? What place has the ancient Israel before us?

And Paul is answering the questions of that congregation, and in answering them, we have one of the greatest treasures of the epistles of Paul, the book of Romans, and so maybe equally some situation had to be devised for the Gentile believers in this great urban center of Rome, and that was a great community of Jews in exile and their relationship with them. So what is born in expediency out of given conditions also could at the same time be established as a pattern or a paradigm of God's intention for all generations, and the fact that the Roman situation no longer prevails is not a reason for us to drop what was given at that first if it had such significance both for the Gentile believers and for the Jews. We only need to know how to find a way to find that reality again in the changed conditions that now prevail in our world and in our communities.

How do we come into that relationship with Jews?

That was the opportunity of Gentile believers in Rome when the synagogue was the principal institution of Jewish life, which today it no longer is. What has been lost by the church in its failure to retain this connectedness with the Jewish community as we heard yesterday, the separation that came when the church coalesced as the official religion of the Holy Roman Empire and began to become syncretistic and adopt pagan practices or names or holidays that alienated the Jewish believers until finally there was an outright Gentile church without any Jewish presence, and that has become the reform into which we ourselves have come in our own generation. We need to review at some future time perhaps the subject of mercy and the interesting, look at the heavy tone that I have here, all the writings of Jews, Jewish scholars, Jewish Bible commentators, sages collected on a variety of topics and the subject of mercy is addressed by the man whom we thought first to have as our convocation speaker, a professor David Blumenthal from Emory University in Atlanta who is the head of the religious studies department, an unsaved Jew, but he's in relationship with faculty members who are Christians. And so when we get on the subject of mercy, because the thing to which you're called is to extend mercy that they may obtain mercy. It will be interesting to hear how he addresses the subject as a Jew coming out of Jewish tradition. So that the first scripture of Romans chapter 12 after Paul has finished, the remarkable exposition of the mystery of the church and the Jew is make of your bodies a living sacrifice as your reasonable service or worship unto the Lord. So that's the logic that follows from the setting forth of the mystery that the very next verse in chapter 12 takes up the obligation to the Gentile believers in Rome in relationship with the Jewish community to make of their bodies a living sacrifice. This is what it's going to take and that you'll do that by the mercies of God.

It casts you upon God.

This is beyond mere religious obligation and so we need to have mercy to extend and without mercy we cannot be to them what we ought and that they will in time recognize it as the mercy of God.

So we'll come back to that subject.

The church in Rome was not yet a separate institution from the synagogue and at the time of Paul's letter the very suggestion that ever would be in the context of Romans at least appears to have been unthinkable. That there would be an institution separate from what the Jews enjoyed as their synagogue in independence from Jews was unthinkable and today it's not only thinkable but it is the acceptable form and mode to have a synagogue on one corner and a church on another in a totally unrelated way. And so in my first letter to the publishers of Nassau publications in New York writing to these rabbis who've never admitted that receiving the letter I said I hope I'm not off the wall. I'm not making an extravagant claim but it wouldn't hurt if you consider the little thing that I am as a beginning expression of some way to establish a bridge of connection between the only two communities in our nation or in the world that are God-revering and Bible-respecting. Whatever our other differences between us this much we have in common and that much is sufficient foundation to establish a kind of relationship that this hour calls for. Please have the courage to welcome me and others like me in taking first steps in establishing a bridge and link of connection between the only two communities that are God-revering and Bible-respecting. So any estrangement between those two communities we need to look upon it as unnatural but our own Christian experience has not fitted us for that. Quite the contrary, our Christian experience makes the union or relationship with Jews unnatural but that's how much the God of this world has so far prevailed and won the day and kept us from the kind of relationship that God intended from the first so that when Paul speaks to the Gentile believers in Ephesus he reminds them that you who are far off. Let's take a look at that in Ephesians chapter 2 from verse 12 or even 11 wherefore remember that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Messiah being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you who were sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle war partition between us if that's true why is there an existing separation if the if the war has been broken down in the expense of sacrifice of the Messiah himself by whose blood those who were far off are now been brought nigh why do we see the barrier raised again why is there a an imposing a structure between the believing Christian and the Jew when God has himself broken down that middle wall of partition having abolished in the flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make it himself of true one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were near for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints of God in the household of God which saints of God you are now fellow citizens with the Jewish saints you have you have come into an already existing body you're not creating a novelty you're being formed in that which already exists and together now you comprise the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together grows into a holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God through the spirit my Lord the book of Ephesians is devastating so full of weight every phrase so pregnant so loaded that it needs to be dwelled upon and its meanings extracted all of this of course is in complete ignorance to the Jewish community but it should not be so with you and even though we do not see the reality of this yet existent we need to live and move and have our being in the anticipation of this fulfillment and that this we already have foretaste of what this household of God is that is being formed so we need to be steeped in this apostolic view of the mystery of the household of God being formed on the basis of the blood of Messiah the wall of partition being taken down and that God is making of two one new man I like the phrase is making that it's not automatic and it's not already done it's in process requires our active participation of which the church has been neglectful and absolutely mindless essentially in modern times I said to our brother in Africa from Kenya in the break I said even if you came from a nation that has not had the existence of a single Jew the fact of the matter is that Nairobi has one of the most significant Jewish communities in Africa largely Israeli but even if you were from a nation in which there's no present Jewish there is no Jewish presence you are not absolved from the obligation of taking into the deepest consideration of the church the central theme of God as it pertains to this people and especially in the last days for not to have this component in your faith and central to your faith is not to have the very format and foundation of God's intention so we need to be reminded of that that's why Paul was excited because he saw in the existence of the Gentile believer the first fulfillment of Israel's own eschatological call that Israel is the first of nations for all nations and so now that Gentiles are being brought into the faith of Israel's Messiah he construed that as the first step of fulfillment of the majesty that by which the whole faith itself is concluded therefore how sensitive must the first Gentile believers be in coming into relationship with the then existing Jewish body seeing that it symbolically represents the great design of God by which the age is concluded I looked at Psalm 22 today which Jesus quoted in crying out from the cross my God my God why hast thou forsaken me but I'm sure that he knew the entire song having inspired it and it ends with a remarkable eschatological statement that I think in the knowledge of which gave him an especial courage to bear the suffering of his painful death in which we need to be reminded in verse 27 of psalm 22 all the eyes all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord and all the kindreds of the nation shall worship before thee for the kingdom is the Lord's and he is the governor among the nations Jesus like the psalmist had a distinct eschatological view of Israel's significance in terms of all nations eschatological means that which pertains to the end that which pertains to the establishment of the kingdom that this Jesus that is born of you shall be exalted and very high and he shall rule over the house of Jacob or of Israel forever on the throne of David it shall be established in keeping with the scriptures in Isaiah chapter 9 7 that unto us the child is born unto us the son is given his name should be called wonderful everlasting God almighty father prince of peace and the government shall be upon his shoulder and of the increase of that government and of its peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David to establish it and to keep it forever some I'm close to the wording Isaiah 9 7 so from the very inception of the life of Jesus the angelic message and the prophetic message is that that birth has got to do with the establishment of a kingdom and a throne and the effect of it is not just for Israel but for all nations and so you are the all nations the gentile believers the word gentile means from make nations going in from the word nation a jew is donation called chosen and anything outside that nation would be the nations the going so when the first gentile believers from the time of Peter the vision that came to him of the of the garment being lowered with the unclean animals Peter take and eat but lord I've never eaten of any unclean thing call not unclean what what God has made clean and when he woke from that someone's knocking on the door from a from the roman house of the centurion asking if Peter would come and speak to them you know what it meant for an orthodox jew to come into a gentile house but it's just not done it's just not done that a jew who is required to keep himself sanctified and reserved for God to come into the house of the unclean the uncircumcised those who eat wrongly and and live in and without the conscious reverence of the God of Israel it's not done except by the vision which was called an incoming and in speaking hardly had he begun his statement the holy spirit falls and and his congregation begins to speak with other tongues and how shall we forbid them more seeing that they have received the same gift as I this was electric the jews reflecting their messiah but they never expected that this grace would be extended to the guardian also this is a stunning radical unanticipated thing that for all that all nations now are being summoned through this messiah and so the first question of the jewish congregation is what do we do with these gentiles how are they to be fitted in do they have to be circumcised do they have to become jews before they can become messianists and so in acts 15 in that Jerusalem conference as their the first most significant issue that is before them that the issue is debated and how to consider these gentiles and that they should not have a yoke put upon them which we ourselves have been not been able to bear in verse 11 but we believe that through the grace of the lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they and all the multitudes kept silence and gave evidence to Bonavice and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had brought among the gentiles by them and after they had held their peace James answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me Simeon hath declared how God at the first visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after this I will return and build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up that the residue of men that is from other nations might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things known unto God are all his works from beginning wherefore my sentence is that we not trouble them from among the gentiles turn to God but they but we write unto them they should abstain from pollution of idols fornication so on and so forth this was a new problem for the early Jewish church what do we do now with gentiles who are being saved and how does James interpret it he interprets it eschatologically he sees these gentiles as the first fruit and the first expression of the great design of God that through Israel all nations are to come into the kingdom at whose center is Zion itself if you turn to the text in Amos the tabernacle of David that has fallen down interpreted by the messiah movement as some somehow the restoration of a certain kind of worship because they miss the governmental kingdom significance of the tabernacle of David you must not miss it the tabernacle of David however you want to understand that in a secondary way as referring to some contemporary form of worship that is Israeli or Jewish in its flavor is not the meaning of the tabernacle of David the tabernacle of David is a statement of the kingdom of God of the rule of God from the throne of David that had been broken down and collapsed with the end of his generation but that God will raise it up when in the last days when he will sift the house of Israel through all nations chapter 9 of Amos verse 9 I will command and sift the house of Israel among all nations isn't interesting at the last redemptive work of God to sift from the whole of world Jewry the remnant from among them for his name to be redeemed and brought back to Zion as the central locus of his rule are to be found first in the nations you can't understand the Jew you can't understand the mystery of Israel if you separate them from the issue of nations we are an exilic people we are in the nations we have been cast out into the nations we will yet again be cast out into the nations and we will be sifted through the nations that last day sifting does not mean that a Jew who is being sifted from New York has nearly to pass through the American continent of Mexico and find himself back God knows through how many nations he may be sifted with because there's something in the genius of God of Israel with regard to the nations our function our purpose and our call is to the nations so that when we examine one of the most pregnant scriptures never ever commented upon in Deuteronomy 32 8 that when God established the number of nations he did so in terms of the number of the sons of Israel right from the beginning there's a correlation between Israel and nations and that when Jesus chose his 70 then send out his 70 the number 70 was understood as being the number of nations that God has established in the world 70 has always had that significance now we have two over 250 nations but many of them have been their own creation like in Serbia ethnic cleansing and and separation from serbians from Montenegro from this from that and each one wants its own independent entity republic that was not God's choosing when the smoke clears at the end of the age and God will have established the centrality of Israel and the kingdom of God through Zion there will be exactly the number of nations that God intended from the first here's the point Jacob rightly interpreted these first Gentile believers as being the fulfillment of Israel's destiny he saw them in the eschatological context of a kingdom that has its center in Zion but that touches all nations as is spoken also in Isaiah chapter 2 that the mountain of the hill of the Lord shall be higher than all mountains and all nations shall come unto it and the Lord shall go forth out of Zion and the word of Lord out of Jerusalem so that nations will study one or more and then even in that text it talks about and he will arbitrate between the nations so the whole context of nations is clearly the kingdom concept of God for Israel so what you need to know in coming into the local the Jews of your own local community is that you're already expressing something of this great design and this great mystery of the relationship of Jews with representatives from the nations instead of the Jews leading you into the knowledge of Messiah you are leading them into the awareness of their own calling which is outside their own present conception they don't even know that they're chosen and likely there's not even a real desire to be it and that doesn't mean that the first occasion you have to sit down you're going to lay all this upon them there may go months in which there's nothing more than just trivial small talk but in this context there's nothing small until such a time as a relationship is established by which a certain measure of trust has been obtained and a question will arise from them about you and your faith and why you are extending yourself sacrificially to be with them or to be for them then you can begin by the spirit of God to give in such measure those things that will begin to open their understanding but you're not to come not to come on hard at the beginning and get that they did there and require this and show them in the scriptures isaiah 53 this says that be prepared to give an answer to every man who asks of you but until he asks don't give an answer before there's a question your function is to provide the question your conduct your demeanor as a gentile showing such an evident heart of love and affection at your inconvenience even at your sacrifice as Paul said in in romans 15 as a sacrifice sanctified and holy by the spirit has got to provoke him to ask why are you doing this don't you have a better use for your time and surely a lot of this must be a mystery to you you don't understand hebrew and yet you're willing to attend these services and and you're trying to learn the language and understand our culture and our customs why are you doing this then you can give answer to the question has been raised so this is going to require of you a sensitivity you don't want to be the proverbial spiritual boat in the or the boat in the spiritual china shop which has been my history you have to work with the real sensitivity which means that your spirit is honed and sensitive to the lord because before you have had time with them you've had time with him and you've been sent by those who are in agreement with an understanding of what this represents and have prayed with you and prayed for you while you're even in that relationship so when i go to see the rabbi every wednesday in order to see him in pennsylvania 150 mile round trip from brooklyn with about twenty dollars in tolls and it's not a cheapie or it's two hours of driving each way after five or six hours with him i stop in statin island on my way through new jersey to pennsylvania with the ladies who are here in order to have a sandwich but a time of prayer for the meeting that day that will take place with the rabbi so it's remarkable what the lord quickens for us at that time and then i go off to see the rabbi while these ladies remain in the posture of prayer while i'm with him if that's not a pattern and a a model of the kinds of things that we should look for i don't know what what is that came about just coincidentally but i'm required to pass to statin island but i'm so grateful to be sent forth out from that little body with their blessing and with their prayer for i'm not just going for a little casual chit chat there's a man's soul at stake and that man is deeply representative of an entire community the issues are beyond all ability are now apart to appraise do i dare go just out of my own uh casual ability or well-meaning intention i've got to go not only as one who has already found the lord in the from rising in the morning in my own devotional time but has had equally a time of prayer with those who understand the significance of this visit with the rabbi and join with me in prayer and then send me in prayer and continue in prayer even while i'm there that's how much an investment with a jew and the jew community requires for every power of darkness and hell that abounds in the in the principalities and powers of the air seeks to discourage stultify thwart bring to nothing this nuclear relationship that is so embryonic so sensitive that a wrong word a word of work a wrong gesture is enough to cut it don't think that they that the powers are not wanting to provoke an ending of that relationship rather than to foment it we're formidably opposed by anything that will move toward the consummation of the ages of the restoration of this people through the one agency that God has established on the earth by which that relationship induced that God is to be obtained the church so we've not been this way here too forth and our life has been relatively casual and undemanding our prayers have been religious nominal just that we pray for the peace of gilston takes about 30 seconds and we go on so this is a whole new requirement but what we will find is that the that the requirement redounds to us as blessing our life becomes more disciplined we're more conscious of the use of our time we find now that the issue of the morning devotional time with the lord is no longer a luxury if we just happen to have the leisure to enjoy it but something to be devoutly sought that we cannot even consider beginning in the day with our first beginning with God and the the communion table which came once a month which was often enough now becomes a weekly and even almost a daily necessity because it's not just a ceremonial ritual thing but it's a covenantal meal and it's the sustenance of the body of the lord the strength of the most high which we need and the dynamic of the spirit of his life as it is represented in the wine which is his blood everything will be radically altered in a new depth which was normative in God's intentions but has been lost to us in modern times and will only be restored as we earnestly take up the central mandate for ourselves as the church their salvation their restoration we offer them to make of our bodies a living sacrifice for them to play second fiddle for them who have been outside of the purposes of God all these centuries long and until they are restored there is no kingdom of God there is no lord that shall go forth out of zion there is no king and throne there is no king mediating between the nations but the nations continue in their incest and their rape and their looting in their pillaging in their destruction in their poverty in their starvation and every terrible debacle that uh that sweeps the earth today that will continue until God's law goes forth out of zion okay now let me raise the question can you continue to be faithful when you see no reward when you obtain no satisfaction when you do not receive any acknowledgement or gratitude but hostility can you continue to be steadfast when you do not receive those elementary gratifications that motivate most men and women can you serve without the acknowledgement from those whom you're serving that you're doing well you know i'm in the lord almost 40 years i've been all over the world in the service of the lord yet there's something in my deeps i think it's a little man that desires the acknowledgement of those who you've served it's wonderful to hear for that message that really and you don't get a kind of you feel something wanting there's something instinctive intuitive that is in the very nature of man that desires the valid legitimate recognition for the extension of himself so that to live and serve faithfully without receiving that and fact receiving the opposite not only uh no acknowledgement but hostility is uncommon and only the deepest saints the most spiritual saints can continue to give their service as a respect as a sacrifice unto the lord acceptable unto him without having to receive the gratification of human acknowledgement are you ready for that now can you even serve the church like that now let alone jews you see the remarkable requirement upon us to come into such a place of priestly detachment that we can serve God without any necessity to enjoy the symbiotic benefit that would return to us because of our service we can serve God without let or hindrance not needing the acknowledgement of men we are as impervious to their criticism as we are to their blessing because we're serving as unto the lord excuse me that's a real requirement and in needing it we ourselves will be transformed you do you think that we can extend mercy without ourselves obtaining mercy i love to point to the precious family in del Rio texas who have a mission to mexico they were he was a gas station operator in oregon or somewhere in the west coast and completely undistinguished i cannot think of a more ordinary christian who has no visible gift of eloquence of speaking but gave their lives entirely unto the world and you were to see the magnificent work that is raised up truckloads of lentils of beans clothing when i visit lines that form that people come up over the bridge and across the border from mexico to receive clothing food and the gospel so for me it's the marvel of what God is producing out of a completely undistinguished couple because they have made themselves wholly available so you will receive by giving you'll extend mercy you'll obtain mercy and so we grow and receive the benefit of our extending ourselves to them something happened to shen in in what he performed for his father he did not come out of that tent the same men as went in and so that will be for us every time we come to send at sacrifice we will obtain and by that means God obtains a church of stature and fullness and maturity while at the same time his witness to his people Israel is going forth significantly so let me just conclude the few more remarks out of this unusual interpretation of romans where he says that it was unthinkable that there should be the existence of anything called the church independent of what was then the synagogue which was the statement of the religion of the God of Israel to whom the righteous gentiles were joined thus for Paul the eschatological promises of the restoration of Israel the gathering of the nations were actually unfolding before their very eyes he saw what was taking place in the largest eschatological sense he saw it apostolically he saw it prophetically he saw the enormous significance this isn't just a little contrivance of expediency now listen you guys learn how to get along with these jews what he saw was there's a mystery here having a remarkable first expression and fulfillment but it will be dashed to pieces and be brought to naught if you act without the appropriate sensitivity if you come on like a bull in a china shop and you throw your weight around and you're arrogant to your new faith and you look with contempt upon those jews who are still laboring under such restrictive requirements about diet you will have destroyed the fulfillment of the mystery because Paul saw the issue in its full eschatological context and you need to see it that way also or you will not have the sufficient forbearance and strength to see it through you've got to see it as more than just a little innovation or a cutesy thing or an interesting little diversion you've got to see it in its apostolic context that this is the mystery of the ages being fulfilled that the relationship between yourself gentiles representing the nations and jews the chosen people of God central to nations and the relationship with them in their synagogue is a preview and a what's the word a foretaste of the on how the gentiles should behave with regard to the authority of jews in the synagogue don't don't uh celebrate your meat in such a way as to bring down those for whom christ died see how he's taking such nitty-gritty details of how to conduct yourself in this relationship with jews that is unparalleled for gentiles because the issue is so great the issue is the completion of the mystery of God's comprehensive kingdom of the centrality of Israel to the nations that you represent he saw it eschatologically and you need to see it that way also these gentiles had joined the historical people of the faith their new participation in the congregation of the faithful of Israel made it imperative that they recognized their obligation was not to boast in this place triumphalism over against the practices in the faith of the jews of rome who had not yet persuaded that Jesus was the promised christ or that christian gentiles were equal co-participants in the blessing of God through faith without the need to become jews these the jews with whom they were relating did not yet understand or believe these things yet they were the believers were required to relate with them and not to boast in this place triumphalism or you will bring the whole remarkable thing down for you to show yourself arrogant and superior is to destroy the work of God this is something new you've not been this way here before all you've known till now is the enmity between gentile and you that has been historic that you've taken up with your mother's milk the suspicion about jews lording it over uh gentiles their schemers of their jacob and their and their wives and their transactions and you're just a simple a gentile you've grown up with that there's a basic distrust there's a suspicion and it works from both ends it has never come before that the two basic entities of God's creation gentile and jews should be brought in a relationship it's charged with historic connotations of everything that acts against God's desire suspicion jealousy envy resentment irritation they are unlike us the point of difference has been the basis for wars ethnic cleansing is between slavic people with slavic people the issue of serbia and what's that other nation kosovo bosnia these are slavic ethnic people but one is called christian and the other is called muslim and they have a history of enmity so much so that the serbians thought themselves justified in cleansing and removing them violently and bodily though they both belong to the same ethnic racial category slavic if that's how deep enmity is among nations who share the same race what shall we say of baswana what shall we say of the millions that were hacked to death by black people with black people because the hutus were different from the um the other the and that difference was enough to justify a wholesale genocide what shall we say then about the difference between gentiles and jews well you guys are having a little glimpse of things between anger and myself what she's saying in a somewhat jocular way is more pointed and painful than you can know the differences i didn't realize what it was to be a jew until i married inga i was an equalitarian democratic oh this racial thing no there's no no we're all the same baloney there's something so deep i'm the man of the tent inga is the woman of the walls with pictures and decorations and hangings of such a kind and she'll take a photo and blow it up i said can you get it any bigger than that because i'm concerned for the economy you know the standard size why so there's the jewish mentality and it collides every day at every point and in every particular i'm living the mystery of the reconciliation that God intends between those two peoples who have been historically historically at enmity inga was so turned off by a little sign this is out of school that we used to hang in the office that just said shalom she found that irritating she doesn't mind the shabbat so long as we don't light candles she wants you that she's not happy for this jewish quotient it seems to her like a kind of a favoritism that rubs her the wrong ways after all she's so partial to the palestinian gentile arabs on the west bank and we should you see to me there's a tension of a remarkable kind that requires a remarkable grace to abide and to pass through that the two might be made one new man black and white black and white a remarkable someone said even at this table we have shem and japheth and ham and the glory of the one new men in the lord God transcending even the most ancient of curses and the sublime thing that has come with messiah Jesus so these gentiles had joined the historical people of faith and they were not in that relationship to boast in a misplaced triumphalism the church has been triumphalistic and i described you gothic architecture that invariably the great cathedrals of europe you can see it today in strassburg you have a statue of fallen Israel a woman blindfolded with a broken reed that abject and depressed and the other side of the portal is the triumphal church with a crown and lording it over the broken thing that has been the historic picture of the church with regard to the jews the defeated object you and the triumphal church even our brother mentioned chrysostom chrysostom the golden orator whose sermons were full of anti-semitic jibes against the jew though he was of an apostolic stature so instead their explicit obligation was to serve non-christian jews in love by subordinating themselves to the authority of the synagogue and to the behavior commensurate with righteous gentiles seeking to honor the one God of Israel as the one God of the whole world should i repeat that instead of being triumphalistic and coming in some superior way to these jews they were to exhibit an obligation to serve these non-christian jews in love by subordinating themselves to the authority of the synagogue you know it's one thing to subordinate yourself to the authority of the church a lot of you have trouble with that i know because i'm an authority in the church i have to catch the flak from very spiritual christians who resist even that authority how then shall you submit to the authority of non-believing jews in the realm of the synagogue excuse me it'd be a real test of your subjection and it's a test that God intends for it will do you a world of good nothing will ever hurt you to be supple and to be yielding to the authorities that God has established because Paul says in from romans 13 to 15 that there's no authority except that which is established by God and that they are the ministers of God for your sake and that they hold the sword and that they can even produce wrath and judgment if you so and the scholars have said well that cannot be the synagogue then Paul must then must be talking about civil society because where in the synagogue do the jewish authorities hold the sword and are able to execute judgments of a violent kind well the answer is the kind that came on Paul how many times was he beaten with rods and ripped came out of judgments in the synagogue against him as being the purveyor of apostasy and he submitted to those beatings because he honored the authority by which they came even though they were in error excuse me so in those days synagogue authority did hold the sword and i was trying to show you yesterday that one of the reasons that the roman authorities acknowledged the validity of judaism is that they gave to the synagogue civil authority over the jewish community itself it's interesting that when the nazis were forming their plans for the annihilation of jews they employed jewish authority to rule over the subjected jews in their ghettos or they could not have conducted the process of annihilation the corpos i forgot what they're called jews who were given a measure of authority over jews in order to execute those kinds of things that the germans could never have themselves perpetrated by themselves without using jewish authority over jews because jews acknowledged it and respected it and obeyed so there's a whole pattern that goes right all through jewish history and life that explains why rome allowed the synagogue a place of prominence that was not given to any other religious calling it was a place of civil rule as well as religious authority and Paul is saying to the gentile christians submit to that so to obey the judaic norms of righteousness and purity in their new faith as they associated with the jews of rome who defined the norms of righteousness and purity the jews themselves the halacha the law the regulations of torah as understood by jews in their practices through centuries were the standards to which these christians gave themselves so that they should not give offense Paul hoped that the christian gentiles would thus understand that their behavior was of historic importance if dear Paul was with us now he would have the same regard for us that we should understand that our behavior is now of historic importance and must not offend the weak in Paul's statements from 13 on enrollments he talks about the weak and the strong which up till now has always been construed and understood as Paul speaking to the more spiritual christians about the less spiritual christians but in the context of this book the author is saying no the weak are the yet unsaved jews and you have to have a special regard for the weak and not abuse them by your strength because you have the more complete face they must not offend the weak and thus contribute to their stumbling over the declaration that Jesus was the christ of Israel uniting jews and gentiles in the worship of one lord and of all humankind and promise the weaker in faith would be the unbelieving jews who have their traditional old testament faith but have not yet come to faith in christ therefore they're weak and that's why they need to eat certain foods and watch certain dietary observations that makes them weak because the stronger faith need no such restriction for all so that for submission to be submission there's got to be an authentic heart of yieldedness to that authority even though it's still short of the acknowledgement of christ as savior and as messiah if we just come in a submission that is to obtain an end even though it's a desired end the quality of that submission is suspect and i think that the jew himself will recognize it and in fact they're already on guard and one of the questions that i'm going to give you to answer today is how should present jewish community leadership be approached how do we commend ourselves for them in view of their traditional fear of missionary proselytizing and general anti-christian fears and prejudices how do we disarm them from looking upon us suspiciously and seeing us coming on our best behavior as only an artifice only a device to obtain our ends which is their conversion to make of them christians do you mean so we've got to transcend and and rise above rise above that motivation there's something that's required of us deeper than just the issue of doing something for expedient sake however great that sake is that is to say to come to a really genuine depth of submission for the father's sake they are beloved for the father's sake they are our fathers in the faith they preceded our faith there's a heritage there that we are acknowledging with respect and honor that cannot be put on as an act that can't be a performance they'll see right through it if jews are anything they have an uncanny ability to see through that which is devious and and phony they they see that they respect and recognize that which is authentic but that means that we have got to come to a reality bond that beyond that which we presently know what is encumbered upon or required of gentile christians to walk in this is there not a risk to loss of faith or its compromise in such a relationship and the answer is yes there is can you see it's like walking the tightwire in this deference to the jew and hearing things of a kind that are horrific as mark and i had occasion to hear when we were cast out of that class these men who were so polite and able teachers when they spoke to us with such demons about Jesus that what our sister connect convey they did Jesus is the man of rise he's a magician he is evil personified i'll tell you if you hear that for the first time the force of that in its anti-christ explosiveness is a battering that many christians will not be able to bear and so i'm yes i'm raising a question we've not been this way here before it puts us in a place of jeopardy in our own faith will we lose it will there be a loss will there be an erosion will there be a compromise is a new kind of threat that puts a greater premium upon the depth of our faith the depth of our knowledge of the lord if we have only been phraseological christians if we have only been creedal christians we will collapse under this test so there's a requirement for authenticity in our own conviction that no barrage no unanticipated powerful contradiction can issue in any loss in our faith and as i shared with you a couple of days ago my own experience in these months has been and in the in this relationship with this rabbi this guy's high power he he his ministry is anti-missionary is that my faith far from suffering loss has remarkably shown increase and strength it was not my intention it just happens to be the fruit of it so that the lord seen our willingness to to jeopardize and put our faith at risk strengthens it strengthens it but we need to be mindful and not naive that we are coming into the lion's den and Paul himself says candidly they are the enemies of the gospel beloved of the fathers for the father's sake but for our sake the enemies of the gospel and he says for your sake how can an enemy ever be conceived as being a benefit how can it be for our sake that this that this jewish people should be our enemies over the gospel because in their uncanny depth of opposition we are required to summon up a depth of faith and understanding and patient love and forbearance that would not be otherwise required from us from anyone the jews are the most formidable opponents of the faith they are intimidating they are informed they are instructive they they are articulate they are accomplished nothing will make us feel more inferior as gentiles as to have to stand in opposite in opposition to them in the issue of the gospel and it's for that reason i believe that God has said Paul through Paul this gospel is the power of God at the salvation to the jews first and also to the greek how would you know the gospel as power until you see its power in a people who are so remarkably opposed to it historically that they're over their arguments and they've got a wealth of arguments and history is on their side and satan has given them every reason to to to denigrate the faith and to denigrate christ what has done done in christ's name to jews is unparalleled in its horror so everything is stacked against us and in order to succeed in the ultimate issue of their salvation their redemption makes such a demand upon us upon the authenticity of our spirituality our knowledge of the lord our knowledge of the word our compassion our patience our forbearance as could not be made anywhere by any other people except them and that's exactly God's design but where have we received that benefit until we come into the actual collision with them through proximity and through relationship that we have sought for they will not seek it and that's what God is putting before us now if i know my jewish people at all i think i can say with confidence they would prefer something direct and unsparing that comes out of a true heart than condescending nice sky padding oh i've always loved you jews are my best friends oh that turns them off completely they'd rather have someone say i find you very difficult your attitude that this is a jew so may we not be nice guys may we not be ruled by culture by deference by what we think is the appropriate behavior may we be ruled by christ to speak the word in season and not only the word but the mood of the speaking as it is as it as it issues out of his own heart but how many of us have that kind of relationship with christ by which he can be both the author of what we speak and the regulator of our mood and i want to tell you that you're listening to a man right now who was saved because 40 39 years ago as i'm trampling about in europe with a pack in my back i'm picked up by a swiss man of the side of the road who learning that i was a jew would not let me part until he first offered me hospitality the swiss coffee house and the man was open was drawing me out why are you traveling with this is past the tourist season and i'm explaining well i'm a modern man if a jew is anything he's a modern man he's modernity himself and i said that my life was broken at his foundations i'm seeking to the answers of of life and as he's drawing up my heart for me i thought what is this guy going to say to me i've been a marxist communist a graduate of university have been traveled there's nothing new under the sun then he says to me in german off he said do you know what it is that the world needs that's right i have my arms full bit of my chest nothing new under the sun arrogant and then he said in a quiet way what the world needs is for men to wash one another's feet when i had never heard that expression but when that word issued out of his mouth i went down like the struck ox i've never recovered to this day it was the calculated word of God that knew me from my earliest youth my marxist days my socialist days looking for some answer to the discourse discord in the world and finding that everything collapses marxism stalinism communism is a false end but that there's a resolution for mankind through a spirit of humility and washing in one of his feet but the way in which that word was expressed it was the word of the lord and it was spoken by the spirit of the lord and it pierced my heart asunder and you know i've been trying to find that man how many times i've been in switzerland and around zurich and and looking for that man asking believers you know man by name of edwin he's a bookkeeper in an automobile agency and he knows the architect and artist he knows culture he knows he was in the choir he sings nobody has ever heard of him and i have to ask 40 years later was there ever such a man or was this an angel and until we come to a place i often say that those jews with whom we are brought in contact have got to ask is this one a man or is this an angel we've not come to get to the right place are we in the relationship with the lord where at any given moment and it'll come upon you suddenly and unawares that what issues from your mouth is not your religious reflex action but the actual word of the lord in the spiritual world that can be the critical moment in the life of a person before you that opens them or closes them to the issue of salvation have you got that kind of relationship that's the very intention of God in confronting you with the jewish community that you'll be brought to that relationship and the fact that we are in the unhappy lamentable state we are as the church is the evidence that we have not been in that dynamic of relationship that God has intended to all generations and that the church enjoyed at the time of Pauline
