The Obedience of Sonship - Art Katz

I'm always reminded of a favorite poem about trees. Some of you might know it. Joyce Kilmer was the composer, a World War I veteran. In Brooklyn we had Joyce Kilmer's square with a tree. It goes something like this.

I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed against the earth's sweet flowing breast. For poems are writ by fools like me, but only God can make a tree. Why do I think of that when I come to the subject of sonship? Because as a tree is a supreme statement of God's handiwork, creative ability, power, so also is a son. A son is like an ultimate expression of God's great nature, creative power, and holiness. So if a man can celebrate a tree, how much ought we to celebrate a son?

Someone ought to write a comparable poem.

I think that I shall never see so great a thing as a son. And in fact, what is a son but a tree of planting of righteousness. So today in chambers, how does he begin and what is the title? For August 9th, Prayer and the Father's Hearing. He's still on the subject of father and he writes, when the Son of God prays, he has only one consciousness and that consciousness is of his father. God always hears the prayers of his son, and if the Son of God is formed in me, the father will always hear my prayers. I have to see that the Son of God has manifested in my mortal flesh. So when I come in contact with the occurrences of life as an ordinary human being, is the prayer of God's eternal Son to his father being prayed in me? In that day you shall ask in my name.

So what is he saying?

This whole genius of incarnation is the Son of God in us whose continual mode is to pray to the Father. He prayed in his own earthly body and now he's praying in us so that our prayer is his prayer and it continues to the Father.

And he says, and my father always hears me. Why? Because I'm always praying to him.

So he's receiving in kind what he himself invested in his own earthly life and continues to express through us. His prayer to the Father. And I was reminded that in chapter 11 of John, in that great climactic moment when he stands at the tomb of Lazarus, put up or shut up, if Lazarus is to come out from that tomb, something monumental has taken place in history that will affect his own death and resurrection.

But will it take place? Will God hear his cry?

Is there any assurance that though he has been obedient and withholding himself from coming to his beloved friend's side in sickness and now has come when he's four days in the tomb and by now he stinketh, his body is already beginning becoming corrupt, that there will be this outstanding miracle to testify of the calling of Jesus as a son, praying to the Father that Lazarus should come forth.

I'd be a lousy Hollywood film writer to present the scenario in its dramatic possibility. But you get the point?

You get the sense of what is at stake in this moment? Jesus standing at the tomb, people mourning already for the one who is dead and passed, and he now to pray and call on the Father for this remarkable resurrection and deliverance. And he prays in this way in verse 41. He lifted up his eyes and he said, Father, how does he begin? Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

How does he know that?

The demonstration, the answer has not yet been given. He knows it because he knows the Father, that the Father hears the Son who calls upon him in his name. I thank thee that thou hast heard me, and I know that thou hearest me always.

Not a remarkable confidence? Can I just interrupt and say, is it yours? Do you have a confidence like that? I know that you hear me, and I know that you always hear me.

Only a son can have that confidence, and a son has obtained that confidence by the continual dependency upon the Father. So when you go into a meeting in Burkino Faso in Africa to 150 or so ministers who have come from distant places and the temperature is 98 degrees and you're dissolving in your own sweat and they are dulled by what has preceded your speaking and are gazing at the ceiling wondering what they're doing there and why had they come at that distance because they heard some report that somehow a man is coming that is worth the hearing of the sacrifice to come and then you have prayed in the hotel room and you have a faint presentiment of what the subject might be but no confirmation but now as this morning the hour has struck and you have got to open your mouth. I'm saying all that to say this, you need to have a confidence that that prayer that took place two hours ago in the hotel room is now going to have its object.

It's now going to be answered. That God did hear your prayer. What were you praying? Lord, the hour is critical.

These men have come at distance and at sacrifice. Their congregations, Africa itself is at stake because Africa is in so desperate a condition and its political and social condition that the church is its only hope and if the church is its only hope then its ministers to the church are altogether critical and therefore what is to be spoken now in this once and for all time will not be given again so I'm asking that you would give them a word from the throne of heaven that is on time and totally appropriate in your wisdom and love for them.

That's the prayer, something like that.

Two hours later you're standing for these black men as I said humorously as the white cork bobbing in a black sea and you open your mouth and believe that your prayer has been heard and that what is going to come forth now is God's answer to that prayer.

Hey guys, this is the long and the short of it. This is what it's about.

Whether you're in Africa, Timbuktu, Omaha, Nebraska, your own locality, whether you're before a congregation, before ministers, in your own family, in your own fellowship, in whatever the private personal intense dealing, it's the same issue that that you believe as a son having historically and continually called upon the father that he always hears you and he hears you now. Then you can have confidence to open your mouth and to speak whatever you find in it.

Got that? This is no small thing.

This confidence is critical because we are going to find ourselves in situations in these last days so totally unprecedented, so new, and staggering in the dimension and the stakes that are represented that no past experience of God's faithfulness will be appropriate for the crisis now. It's a new crisis that has got to be met afresh by the same God and you have to trust that whatever you're going to speak and do is that answer. So it requires a son's confidence in the father who hears because up till now all of your prayer has gone forth to the father and it has been received, has been answered sometimes in ways that surprise you and because you have always prayed to him he always hears you and that's why Jesus says I know that you always hear me. So now when it's put up or shut up and my whole identity status before the nation Israel which is the greatest crisis of recognition that they have ever been required to make, that a man and the flesh has come among them that purports to be not only their Messiah but their God, that whole issue that staggers Israel to its foundations and for which nothing in its history has prepared them is now at stake in what will what your answer to my prayer will be as I stand before the tomb of this dead man for whom these people are weeping at the loss.

Got the idea?

The stakes are great and if you're a son you know that whatever the situation the stakes are great whether it's Africa whether it's the tomb of Lazarus whether it's an ordinary daily transaction whether something in your own fellowship the stakes are always great.

Eternity is always at issue.

If you don't see it like that if you think it's only a momentary thing or a light thing that you can afford to pass or fail you're not seeing as a son you're seeing humanly you're not seeing spiritually everything is weighted with eternity.

Don't you see that?

Even right now, even today, even the way in which we're conducting ourselves at this school and then this good well tomorrow's another day.

Yeah but that's tomorrow. This day will have passed it will not be given again.

We dare not bumble and fumble and miss it out of even our best intentions. There has got to be what is now what is appointed what must come forth or tomorrow makes no sense. Tomorrow will not be a reality if it's not in the continuum of today.

But what about today Lord? Now has come. The bell has rung, the class is assembled, the recording instruments are on, something has got to come forth.

Sonship, the responsibility, the acute moment and you are it and you feel altogether alone. I, no one else, I alone am it and then you open your mouth as Jesus did here with that prayer in the hearing of those about him punctuated by the word father.

He could have said dad, Abba, but it wasn't a devotional moment.

He's calling God in a name that is appropriate to his holy stature, but he's calling upon him as one who is in precious relationship with that father. I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

By the way there's gratitude, there's praise, right, in his opening statement.

And I know that thou hearest me always, but because of the people stand by I said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me. So I don't want to go on and make this a text for a sermon, but the issue of what Jesus represents about the reality of God as one sent hinges on the moment of the answer he'll receive from the father to whom he's praying. I mean it's colossal for Israel that he's the one sent, a man who palpably sweats and exhibits the frailties of humanity is actually the sent one, the Messiah, the hope for deliverer and very God himself.

No way.

And as my Jewish kinsmen tell me in New York, if God wants to change our understanding that we have held now for all these thousands of years that were given at Sinai and fire and thunder and all of the dimensions of God's majesty that made us to tremble, if he wants to change anything he has to speak to us again and in equally a climactic moment. We need another Sinai if we're to believe that what we understand about God is to be altered, but not a Jesus, not someone who comes in frailty and in his own humanity and weakness and has not a place to lay his head, cannot be the avenue or the mode by which God is going to bring us up to date on his latest revelation of how he's to be perceived and understood.

Understand what they're saying? We demand another Sinai.

God gave his initial statement and law and fire and smoke and if he's going to change it you'll have to do it again in fire and smoke, but not by some upstart, not by some character who is dubious. So everything is at stake here that they might know. I'm saying this aloud to these people who are hearing that they might know that the Father has sent me on the answer you will now give to my prayer as I call upon you as Father. What if our every moment was as charged with something as significant as what was at stake in that moment with Jesus? And what I'm saying is if we don't see our every moment as being charged with uttermost significance we are not seeing or we are not living that our moments can be so charged. We're living beneath the call of God and we're not making ourselves available to God that the issues of our life will be his issue and require his answer to verify, to confirm and to perform his work. So when he had just spoken he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth and he who is dead came forth both bound hand and foot with grave clothes, his face was bound with the cloth and Jesus saith unto them, loose him and let him go.

It's almost like Elijah at the contest at Carmel with the false prophets of Baal.

You build your altar, I'll build mine. You slay your ox, I'll slay mine and you call for your God to consume your sacrifice with fire, I'll call for my God. Let that God who answers my fire be God.

He's confronting an entire apostate nation who actually desire in their hearts that he should fail.

They are already compromised, they have already halted between two opinions. They don't want to see Elijah succeed because his success would mean back to square one, the giving up of the false Gods of Baal and their idols and the confidence and satisfaction that the carnal have derived and a return to a true relationship with the living God that requires earnest authentic sacrifice and a life of total dedication and consecration. They don't want that return, they don't want to see the fire fall and so he gives his opponents the first opportunity who leap on their sacrifice, cut themselves, nothing happens. There's no real God to whom upon whom they're calling and then he calls a draw closer, wet that sacrifice with 12 barrels of water, make it even less amenable to an answer from God by fire and then he turns to God and he says if I have done these things at your word and nowhere in the text does it indicate that he has done these things according to his word. Though God has spoken to him conspicuously previously move to this place, go by the stream, Jabak, you'll be fed by ravens, do this, do that. In this crisis nothing is indicated in the text that God has told him to do what he's doing. It could be that he had not heard a voice as explicit as the voice that told him to go to this stream or to be fed by ravens or to go to Jarapheth or any of the things that Elijah arose and did according to the word of God.

But where was the word of God here?

Maybe it was no more than an intuition, maybe it was a hunch, an inward sense that God is requiring this ultimate showdown with apostate Israel and requiring it in this way.

But what if the hunch is wrong?

What if Elijah has a propensity for melodrama and he set up for a climax that was not God's intention? And though all Israel has been gathered and the stakes are ultimate and great, what kind of answer will now come? You think that he has a supreme confidence that fire is now going to fall or is there a tremor of apprehension and trembling that though I have believed all these things according to your word, I may yet be wrong.

I may yet have missed it. My batting average till now has been a hundred percent but there's no guarantee for now.

There's always the prospect that I may have missed you and missed you of all places and times at the most crucial moment ever. Nevertheless, now the moment has come and I raise this prayer to the Father. If I have done these things according to your word, Lord, give the answer before this people that they might know that you alone are God. And boom, the fire of God descended, consumed the sacrifice, and the nation did go down and cry out the Lord is God, the Lord is God.

I'll say all that to say this.

Both for Jesus at the grave of Lazarus and Elijah at Carmel, however precious the relationship with God, however sacrificial, however consecrated, however previously honored by God in his faithfulness, is no uttermost and total guarantee and assurance in this moment that a man may not miss it and yet is required to act and to call and to believe and to trust. Praise God that God did answer but the prophet needs to be prepared that the answer will not come. And then who will be slain at the brook?

Not the false prophets but himself.

And he has to be prepared for that disappointment, that failure, though God being God maybe has a greater purpose of bringing fire.

Maybe there's yet a longer period of apostasy for which Israel must pass. Maybe he will never be vindicated in this life.

So Lord help me here to persuade your saints that sonship, knowledge of the Father, trust, prayer, even in the last moment there's a trembling, an apprehension, and a prospect always that we may have missed you. That your answer if it comes will not come as expected or may not come at all and yet we're required to act.

So what's the answer for that?

We need as faithful a relationship with God over a history that we by his grace are able to obtain but when we come down from the hotel and stand before these black men who have come from distant places and now open our mouths we need to be prepared for anything that may come or may not come. So that faith in that moment is a kind of dying.

Trust is dying. Praise God that it did come.

But I can think of other occasions in my little history with God when it did not come and my prayer was as sincere then as it was in Africa where what came was a dull thud or a disappointing silence or some other contradiction and that we need to be prepared for the one as for the other and that this willingness for such moments where your heart stops beating and where the stakes are enormous and you're not going to get a second shot at this is that the very essence and at the of sonship and the relationship with the father of trust and relationship through prayer.

I know that you always hear me.

That's why it's more beautiful than a tree for God to raise up a son like that and how far will God go in making an exquisite son who will be obedient in the death of that moment and be willing to prepare and to receive the failure of an answer as well as to rejoice in an answer and that the one will be as satisfying as the other if it serves the purposes of God and his glory. That the son is willing to suffer a personal disappointment and a failure of expectancy if that failure is more congruent with God's ultimate purposes than the fire itself.

Got that? That's a son, you guys. That's a son.

Anything less is just a practitioner, a religious functionary, a guy who does it by the numbers and has a certain kind of human macho expectation that is not a son's reverence for the father's glory that is greater than the issue of the success of a moment and a son like that, sonship like that is not born in a day. Sonship like that is groomed, is wrought out, has a history, has a dealing, has an involvement, has an investment, has a suffering, has disappointment with men in whom you have confidently trusted and and loved and experienced their rejection and even their vile rejection, their hostility. Men with whom you have gone into the house of God together have lifted up their heel against you, with whom you've broken bread. Betrayal are all constituent elements in God's program and the preparation that they're bringing forth of the most golden statement that reveals himself and glorifies him, a son. We will not be it until we appreciate what that word means and it is as much under abuse now as every other holy word like worship, which is being battered out of recognition, out of shape, or faith, the whatever it is, every word of God is suffering abuse and defilement in our time. Truth has been turned into truisms and the word son and sonship is suffering exactly the same. So part of our prophetic function is the jealousy for the word, what it connotes, what it represents. It represents the revelation of the Father who has sent his son, which is Israel's salvation and that of all mankind is at stake in an answer to prayer to the Father, to a relationship to prayer as a life of prayer and not an expedient means of commerce and transaction with deity to obtain our ends. The prayer with the Father is out of a life of prayer.

As P.T.

Forsythe says, the soul of prayer is not a mechanism for the obtainment of expedient answer.

It's a life.

Jesus prayed to the Father before the day began in communion, not in detailed instruction as you've said the other day. Now I know that you have always hear me and now I'm standing before this people and praying like this that they might know that you have sent me.

Not that I should be gratified but that they should be saved.

So come now when everything hinges upon your answer and give it and the Father did. These are the remarkable tensions of the faith which only a son is willing to bear. If you're not experiencing it as tension, I can almost say you're outside the faith and you have reduced the faith to some kind of formulaic parody of the faith that just quotes scriptures and has certain principles and doctrines. If you're in the faith, you've made yourself a candidate to bear the agonizing tensions because in the last analysis you're on the spot as a son.

Something has got to come forth. You cannot absent yourself or withdraw or go back to your hotel room.

Something is on the line right now and it's got to come forth through you and the Father himself is waiting for your faithfulness and performance to express it and so there's the remarkable dynamic between Father and son in a historic moment whose time has come and if we cop out because we're unwilling for the death which is that tension and the trust then to open our mouths and express it, we have failed him.

But how could we fail the Father? See what I mean?

But this will save us from reducing the faith to some formula, formulaic faith. Presumption is the conduct of the arrogant, the bumptious, the immature, the self-assured, the fleshly, the carnal, the religious, the practitioner makes these presumptuous assertions but he's outside the things the dimension we're talking about and more than that he's not reserved for those Godly moments where the issue of the revelation whom God has sent is at stake. He will be involved in some religious claptrap, some entertainment for charismatics or some other kind of a thing as a televangelist in which the great issues are never at issue.

Boy, where did that statement come from? So where did that boldness come from?

Where did that assurance that makes the hearers startle and performs the act? It came out of the trembling, it came out of the deaths, it came out of the trust, it came out of the history, it came out of the prayer, comes out as boldness but the auspices is humility and suffering. That the son, dependent as he is on the father, is also an instrument upon which the father is dependent. If the son doesn't come through, he doesn't act, he doesn't, if he's unfaithful, the father has been has failed, has been left stranded, disappointed that the father is willing to extend himself in the issue of his name and his honor predicated on the faithfulness of the son to express what is needful in those given moments.

There's a remarkable reciprocal relationship from father and son.

If the son dies multiple deaths in his faith in believing and trusting, how much is the father also?

I won't say trembling but he's committed something to the son. There's something reciprocal, it's not just a one-way street.

We need to appreciate the father's investment in a son and the trust in the son in his faithfulness and obedience without which the work in the earth will not take place. So I want to get to that then to give us the fuller picture of the relationship between father and son because that picture is the issue of God himself. The revelation of God is nowhere better, more aptly given than in the relationship between father and son.

In fact, it's relationship that always reveals truth. It's not some static thing or a statement or a single act. It's in relationship.

That's why the body of Christ is the demonstration of the wisdom of God to the principalities and the powers of the air, not a single man's ability or, what's the word, it's something, a demonstration through the church.

Where? In its relationship.

Something of God is revealed in the relationship between the father and the son. Not just something but maybe the essence of God is revealed in that relationship. So we need to contemplate that relationship because the contemplation is the revelation of God as God that had waited for that moment in time in which he sends his son. Who knows God the father well enough that you can act when he's not speaking and act out of an intuition of a sense that is the product of a history with God in an untoward moment for which there's no precedence and yet you're required to say something and do something and the face of what you say and do will give the carnal ammunition to say you've missed God.

That's not God.

That's not the way what he would say or do and you may not be vindicated in the moment and maybe you're not even you'll not even be vindicated in your lifetime and yet in heaven and eternally you'll hear from the father, this is my beloved son whom I will please.

Well done.

Good and faithful servant because you were able to act when I did not tell you what to do because that obedience would not have glorified me as much as the act that issues out of your intuition of what would be appropriate out of your history of relationship with me in a moment that has come that takes you by surprise and for which you've had no preparation. That is the essence of a son and I know that I know that I know that such moments are ahead of us and that these are the discerning moments and these are the defining moments of the faith in the last days against a world that is apostate and where we are even opposed by our own Jewish kinsmen in their ignorance opposing themselves and us in their own ignorance and yet we shall be required to act speak or do something in a way that by their every measure will seem to be contrary to God and an offense to God and he has not told us to do it how then do we know how to act in that moment. It issues out of an intuition a sense of God as God that has been obtained over a history with him that now fits you for this moment and when I mentioned to a brother who's no longer with us how intuition is so much a component of the prophetic life he left me to scorn as if intuition is a faculty for which God has no respect whatever so I want to say he has great respect intuition is not just a hunch of a carnal kind I guess I guess I guess intuition is present in it is sensing is discerning having an inward notion of something that is appropriate to God how do you know that because you know the God to whom it's appropriate and I'm always asking the church do you have a history with God that they blink and look at me like what are you talking about they've never before even heard the concept that a believer should have a personal history with God in which he has brought and brought through trials crises of a kind unique to him and appropriate in his growth that God will give periodically out of his wisdom and love for which there's no other substitute but it's every time fearful every time painful every time a death and many will not open themselves to that dimension they want a formula in faith where everything is fat a pat prescribed nailed down they don't want to open themselves to this experiential unknown realm of dear being dealing being dealt with by God and the bringing forth of a son so sonship is a voluntary and willing surrender to end be entered into a process by which one is formed and and which suffering is a conspicuous aspect but the end thereof is glory to God the father so this brother writes what exactly was Jesus saying about his relationship to God when he called him father what should we understand by that what is the importance of that relationship for the whole structure of the gospel and the answer is everything in what sense is the relationship between Jesus and his father unique and to what extent can others share in it is it just a once and for all between Jesus the father or is there a way in which we by union with the son can also be in that relationship of some to father and in fact because of that union as chambers are saying the Lord is still calling upon the father through our prayer see so these are remarkable questions that he's sounding from the beginning of this chapter if we do not know that Jesus related to God as his father we know nothing about him at all if we do not know that Jesus related to God as his father we know nothing about him at all not only the him Jesus but the father him we don't know the father at all and we don't know Jesus at all if we do not know how Jesus related to the father because that relationship both revealed the son and the father both then and now our relationship now reveals again the father as we ourselves have revealed their sons that same dynamic the genius of it that Jesus was the first begotten son to demonstrate now is explicated and set forth again by the many who have been called to glory as sons but the principle the reality the mode is exactly the same for us as it was for Jesus or much the same he had certain advantages that we don't enjoy as God so as well as the obvious dependence of the son upon the father there is a complementary dependence the other way around of the father upon the son whoever thinks about that that the father would be dependent upon a son isn't that unbecoming to his deity that he should allow allow himself to be brought to a situation where he has some measure of dependence upon the son shouldn't he be all sufficient unto himself and guard the integrity of his deity doesn't he make himself vulnerable when he allows for a situation where if the son is not obedient and faithful the father himself suffers loss what kind of a father would take that risk naturally and humanly speaking that his integrity his name is very much dependent upon the conduct of his son and yet God the father is willing for that dependency and it's important for us to see and know that or else we will not understand the totality of what father and son mean in their relationship the dependence upon the son upon the father but not all not excluding a dependence of the father something had to be performed in a moment of time in Burkina Faso on that day when I came down from the hotel room to commence speaking to these ministers that had to issue freely and voluntarily by out of my faith and what I am in him in a given moment or the father would have lost the thing for which that investment was given there's something free here something voluntary here that's not automatic that's not cut and dried there's a dynamic of trust faithfulness and dependency that's very much alive and that the father is willing to bear that with Jesus and with ourselves so that puts upon us a heightened sense of importance of for our obedience in our faithfulness we can't disappoint God we can fail him by copying out we can fail him by withdrawing ourselves because we don't want to face the tension of that moment and disappoint that woman whose child is being prayed for there's something required from us for his sake that if we do not perform it he will lose something and that heightens the reality of what we are about but if I did not open my mouth the father would have been denied or if I had spoken something already proven and tested that had been a success on other occasions just to get by on this occasion the father would have been failed I would have kept my dignity and my reputation so to speak but his purpose would have been lost forever so there was an obedience required of a son that happens when you open your mouth and trust and and give your voice believing that what you have been prayed for will be answered and the moment that that your voice goes forth the Lord is there with his word are we willing to be disappointed and believe that that disappointment has served and we are as able to receive that with grace and praise as an answer that would have glorified and exalted us as his ministers right because he cannot fail and he will give an answer but are we prepared for an answer that can be construed and experienced as failure do we have to be gratified do we have to see men go down do we have to see the remarkable unction and anointing what if men would yet appear to be bored or look at you hostilely and shoot arrows at you because you appear to them as the white man and you're representative of what is to be feared of despised or resented and you don't see the gratitude are you prepared are you willing and maybe this is the answer to presumption we are willing and God's answer to be disappointed it does not have to fulfill our expectancy but only his sometimes it will exceed our expectancy and then our joy is unspeakable full of glory and we need to be vindicated in that moment we need to see our obedience honored what if there's no present moment of vindication what if it doesn't come till the following year or next year what if it doesn't come at all in this life these all died not having received the promise and yet they were faithful until death and their their compensation will come in a way that I have not seen in the earth not heard eternally as imagine hearing that great consolation the words well done good and faithful servant but when do we hear it we don't hear it in the day in Africa and we may not hear it until the day of eternity but we can believe for it and trust and into it what is the response that God is wanting sonship I never worked for it it's I mean it's adventure no what's the word it's it's an undertaking it's a it's a creative remarkable tension of relationship of trust between heaven and earth in crisis things that have great portent for time of eternity that are alive that that are the reflection of a history of relationship in the formation of things through obedience is and the answers of the father over a period of time I'm feeling my way I I can't define it but I'm I'm groping so much as to say it needs to be appreciated it needs to be esteemed as an ultimate thing this is the purpose for which you have been saved but it's not automatic you're not being punched off the assembly line you're a unique son but the quint the quintessential elements of sonship are the same for you as for any in the school of obedience with God the Father but as a school to which you need freely to enter and to submit yourself this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him. Exodus chapter 4 where God says let my sins go that they might serve me Israel is my son my firstborn so the very designation of Israel and the concept of God is as sonship and sonship is always relative as someone has said to regality to to being crowned to to governmental function in the kingdom of God we're called to rule at the rain share the throne of God in authority as sons we're being prepared for something of a millennial and of eternal kind that requires a maturity and the character of God in its performance for which this life is preparation so a son is not just a vacuous title a son is one who's called to rule and Psalm 2 says that I've set my son on the holy hill of Zion I've not set a child on the hill I've set a son I've said they I've set a tempered matured son who has been trained through through suffering and I've given him rule I've given him the nations for his autonomy and he will break them with a rod of iron worship the son bow down let's let's be be angered against you kiss the son everything is the son the son and so it is that son and we also ourselves as sons call to rule and reign with him because we share that maturity that responsibility and that character because the ruling and reigning of God is not a mechanical a bureaucracy it is a holy dispensation of wisdom and kindness and mercy and instructing men how to live righteously that only a son can convey to administer the kingdom of God because the scepter of that kingdom is righteousness not autocracy or bureaucracy a son doesn't allow himself to lapse into stagnation and into silence and and isolation a son is a fervent and active entity in the relationship with the father he receives a responsibility trust for the grace of it we're not just living for the present moment that there are consequences of our present moment that have implications for the future that need to be weighed and for which we will therefore make a sacrifice that we would be reluctant to make if we thought it was only now it's the consideration of what follows that enables us to be more heroic and larger in our obedience is that perhaps we would otherwise be and more faithful in what we perform and more jealous for that performance and that the whole thing hinges on an intuition of a moment but that moment is loaded not only for now but for all the future what God sowed in Africa in those speakings is immeasurable I cannot tell you I cannot estimate it but I know that something was sown and set in motion that will have consequences for those nations and for the continent that would not have been if that particular word had not been given in that authority that power that anointing in that moment it will go it has a continuing consequence and what does that mean it will affect life and death conditions will take place by which life that would have failed in infancy will not be preserved where men will have engaged in violence and and and disease they will be diverted and moved toward God all of the consequences of a church coming into its realities church will affect the continent and those would otherwise suffered and would have perished will have been saved from the presence and the thing that the church now expresses because of the investment that has been made into it by men who have come in obedience to the father and have spoken and performed the appointed thing so these considerations are part and parcel of a son's consciousness and you know to begin to think like that and to live like that will mark you in this world and in this life as being strange and your own wife may be offended because you've become now so heavenly minded or you're not attending the practicalities that make for her security because women are insecure more and need to see the practical things being attended like the garden being watered and there you are with your lofty considerations that make them to trim a tremor of insecurity that you have to factor in and work through as part of the grip of this remarkable heavenly call as it is being acted out in the earth and the reality of the conditions which God himself has established wow who asked for this we thought we're just getting saved no you're being called to be a son in the image and the pattern of the once and for all and begotten son who is the patterned son therefore it behooves us to dwell upon his obedience his conduct his relationship his faith his knowledge of the father is our prototype that we might be groomed as sons being fitted for glory this is a study it's an exertion it requires an involvement on an investment that those who have no heart-to-be sons are unwilling to give but you guys have come at distance sacrifice and expense for these purposes and so much as I'm able to recognize the Lord is pouring out to meet that need that that desire that you might become it praise the Lord so much so last night yesterday that by the time I got home you couldn't pick me up with a blotter there wasn't anything left I was drained through and through I may experience that today but the Lord is pouring out why that's what he is in himself he doesn't give us by the spoonfuls he's lavish you've called you've come he's giving you in a great measure that you might be formed as sons so I'm delighted what if David's failings were needed for all of the subsequent generations that have followed including your own what if David did not fail because of some intrinsic moral defect what if his failure and his the shame of his staggering sins were necessary for him especially to experience as the sweet singer of Israel as the great psalmist whom we have quoted as the king of Israel all the more that we ourselves would receive a comfort in our own failing when we see ourselves in the light of his that David made himself a voluntary candidate for shame as Jesus himself the greater David later in order to benefit the generations that would follow now David's failing and no way the scripture say this this is pure heresy pure subjective prophetic fancy but I wouldn't put it past God that when he found a son in whom he was well pleased beloved how to say a man in my own after my own heart he found a candidate who was willing for shame disgrace failure in order to set forth the deepest statement of repentance remorse and contrition and return that has served generations of believers more profoundly than any other statement in the entire Holy Writ. He found a man willing and that's a son that's a son and Jesus was such a son who exactly wore that shame became sin itself the loathsome thing for him for which he said let this cup pass was not the physical suffering of crucifixion it was the moral shame the loathsome experience of actually becoming as sin that he had to bear and that he would become so in an offense to a holy father that the father would have to withdraw himself and he would have to cry my God my God why has not forsaken me who has lived eternally in your presence I can't bear the absence have you guys ever had a moment like that where God has withdrawn his presence never presume upon God and think that what issues out of you has anything to do with your ability your persona your skill your anything it is all together and totally given and at any moment when God will withdraw it you are as a dead piece of meat you're capable of nothing so what did I'm saying we'll have to say this what did it feel like for Jesus at the crisis moment of the cross to experience the absence of what he had known all of his eternal life long and the most intimate fellowship with the father before his coming down from glory and now when he most needed it's gone that's what he bore in the same way of the indignity and shame of David for his transgressions that were so much he said blot out my transgressions my my bones are broken I can't stand it for my sin is ever before me what does he mean the anguish of it the moral horror of what I performed has broken on my consciousness and I cannot take it from my memory not only the deeds that I performed but the condition that made those these possible that condition is ever before me blotted out only you can only your blood only your hissa or I've got to live with the anguish of this iniquity he bore that so that we would have comfort that if God could redeem and restore God can forgive that there's a place of repentance for the most hideous abominable sins sins performed even by the greatest and most righteous sons and he bore that that's a sign are we are we willing also so to be sons of that kind or do we want to be sons who swim in glory and honor and distinction and praise and compliments are we willing for the other side are we willing for the inexplicable things the disgrace where you're not able to give answer and you can't explain yourself where you'll be misunderstood just by the nature of the thing and you have to bear that or where the word falls flat like like lead where in Russia as my brother knows the ministers refused to come upstairs to the meetings because they were offended by my first message and stayed below through a whole series of days and we had to bear that indignity but there's instance after instance if we're not willing for the one we shall not be sonship is not only a glory it's a suffering and it's a voluntary and a willering willing suffering or we shall not attain through it I'm a dead man without you father I can do nothing if you really believe that you'll be breaking your neck to get to the communion table and you could not get there fast enough and often enough they're not once a month not enough you need to be refurbished renewed and have the quality of God's life in his body and blood administered afresh by your eating and drinking it's not just a a thing that takes place periodically that to which you're required to give yourself you'd rush to the community table because you know you're a dead man without him you need his strength so while you guys were turning over in your beds this morning what was I doing upstairs my place I'm a communion I've got my little bottle of wine my little ziplock bag with stale matzah and before I even begin my devotional reading and prayer I'm taking it you know why because unless the Lord has renewed in me and the power and the reality of his life how shall I even extract from the devotional material what I ought and how shall I pray as I ought that the commencement of the day when the stakes are so enormous and God has brought such a measure of his sons and daughters here I need his life before I even begin to be renewed by the taking of his body and blood afresh we neglect this great sacrament because deep in our hearts we have no conscious sense of its need it's not that we are dead men we're all too capable and somehow we can get by we can perform we can function we can succeed but our son knows he's as good as dead because he's not called to success he's called to glory and it's the glory of God forever eternity is at stake not just the present condition of Africa though that itself is more monumental I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree I think that I shall never see an accomplishment grander more glorious more God honoring that the formation of a son God forbid by God that that great word should be trafficked in made merchandise another little present current phrase that has become popular and lose its enormous value that has come to us through the example of a son who has come down from heaven into the earth and showed us what it means to be a son to a father who is in heaven he's after something ultimate and the creation itself is trembling and prevailing waiting for the manifestation of these not any other statement but sons will relieve nature from its own bondage thank you my God oh what a call what a call Lord we reiterate our commitment my God with a greater depth of comprehension than ever we knew before you've been spelling out and punctuating what it means it's not a GP it requires ultimate investment and disgrace and shame and misunderstanding and agonizing slot that can't even be spoken and we're willing my God because it's an eternal masterpiece in the image of him who is the patterned son and we welcome being conformed to that image take from us presumption of any kind and not the least of which is our own image what we think we ought to be spiritually our own lofty sanctifying ethereal spirituality my God that is phony and strip us of all of that and get down to the root and the core and deal with it and shape up at your hand my God what is in your image not our own true sons will not fail you my God when your honor and name is at stake thank you oh bless these sons whom you've sent into this place in these days and work and perform my God those things for which you have called them thank you lord oh let there be a celebration in heaven let the invisible power of witness clap their hands my God where they have been waiting for this consummation without which they themselves sons that they are not made perfect without us thank you for our participation in the so great eternal and cosmic glory yes lord thank you my God for which you sent your son
