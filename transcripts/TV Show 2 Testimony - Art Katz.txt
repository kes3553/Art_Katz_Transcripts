TV Show 2 Testimony - Art Katz

Ben Israel with Art Katz and Paul Gordon Welcome to Ben Israel.

My name is Art Katz and I'm Paul Gordon We are delighted to have you with us today to share with us and rather unusual type of telecast we think Two Jewish men who have had an extraordinary experience in the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob Our lives have been transformed. We've been deeply touched of God and he's given us this opportunity To share with you and to bring you into some awareness of what's happening with Jewish men like ourselves across the land and in the world Paul, why don't you tell us a little bit about your experience in Israel's God? Well, I came from a normal Jewish home Hebrew school bar mitzvah at the age of 13 and I went into the army and I was looking for reality I saw a number of different things going on in the world about me But I knew one thing I knew that I was very unsatisfied with life There was just something that was lacking something that was missing and I would look for reality here and I would look for it there And I guess that it was when I first Found or was found of by the God of Israel and had a living reality With the God of Israel that life took on meaning for me Knowing God in reality is really the whole thing of course my life is different than yours in many respects and yet Very much the same we came from different parts of the country.

I'm a Brooklyn boy. You're from California My background was in left-wing politics and radical causes.

You were a conservative yeah, and yet we were both embarked in a kind of a search in a quest for reality and for truth and As far as I was concerned, of course, I knew nothing of such a God You know, I Was reading through your book Incidentally, my brother art has written a book called art are called Ben Israel an Odyssey of a modern man And art when I was going through this You tell us that it was on the the deck of a tramp steamer that you first realized that Jesus was the Messiah And as a Jewish man, this must have come as quite a shock to you well, of course, it is a shock because That name has been associated with so many bitter things in our life in history caught for us conversions and exiles and many things which we've had to suffer through the centuries and I have to confess that It had a bit of distaste for me And yet God had prepared me in the course of months of travel as a disillusioned man in my 34th year traveling about Europe seeking for philosophical answers to my life having unusual encounters with people of a kind that I had not met before in America real believers and they had a kind of a peace and they Calm a joy that they exuded that frankly made me jealous And they spoke to me about the reality of a God that I had not thought possible and On a trip to Greece from Italy to Greece, I think it's rather significant that I was going to a place that was for me a kind of spiritual homeland because my values Were really more scented in Greece than they were in Israel.

I exalted all things that were human and intellectual This is kind of the way it is today.

That's typical And aboard the deck of that ship the cheapest way to go I found a fellow Jewish passage who had a copy of a New Testament Of course, I didn't have a very high regard for any kind of scripture I believe that a collection of fables and myths and I felt especially that the New Testament was a Gentile book Not one fit for a Jew to read But you know that as I began the reading of that book a strange power began to affect my life There was a certain authority that came from these pages that I could not easily put aside and the personality of Jesus Was stunning I had had a certain kind of stereotype notion of him in the pictures and the renderings of him that I had Seen through the course of my earlier years as a kind of a blonde Jesus with milky blue eyes and aquiline nose But the Jesus who came out of the pages of this book was quite a recognizable Jew In fact, he spoke with such power with with such authority that like I was compelled to read on He made statements that I knew would not be befitting a spiritual man. They were in the in the slightest the least to say presumptuous He said that he had come not to destroy the law but to fulfill it that if we saw him We saw the father and that he and the father are one One occasion a woman said that when the Messiah comes he will teach us all things and he answered he who speaketh unto thee And he I was shocked by these acute startling and unequivocal statements and I knew that I was being forced into a kind of corner that there'd be no neutral ground in the Reckoning with the Jesus that came out of these pages either I would have to find him condemned as a Gross blasphemer or a truly fall at his feet as other Jews did and acknowledge him as Messiah Lord and God You know Paul I came to one passage in the reading of that New Testament that I'll never forget Jesus had made the startling claim that he had come not to destroy the law but to fulfill it and The woman had been taken in the act of adultery with which so many of us are familiar She was caught in the act guilty as we all are in God's sight For the for the scriptures say that we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God that there's no man good No, not one And I sort of burned with her in her predicament knowing in a sense that I too in God's sight Had been found guilty caught in the act and that I deserve the full penalty of the law And yet there was something in my heart that I couldn't identify that was a cry for something beyond the things which are legal And I just couldn't understand how Jesus could answer the predicament which he was in frankly. I feared for him I didn't want to see my new hero demolished and I felt that I had come to a hero at last not another culture hero who would fail me as To call mox is in the Eric Fromes of the past, but how could he possibly answer to this predicament? So I closed the book Trembling with my heart pounding Trying to think of some answer that I myself would give for that predicament The law demanded death by stoning and yet the cry was something greater than the laws just requirements And I knew that the men who were a circled about Jesus Were men who are highly indignant about him not because they were Jews so much as that they were men and religious men I think there's an especial quality in Jesus which unmasks the pretension and the fraud of the lives of men Have you sensed that they've seen that?

Maybe you can say a word as You've acknowledged that in your own experience.

Well, I was thinking I was thinking of Jewish men and women who when they come to the realization that Jesus is the Messiah and they go home to break this to their families It's like the house falls down on their heads Just the name of Jesus just just that name which for so many years has been serious or trouble to our Jewish people Brings on all kinds of reactions and I imagine you experienced the same thing didn't you I experienced it in that Confrontation that was described and I was experiencing it in my own personnel You were probably even thinking about that weren't you also when you were when you came to the realization that the the New Testament was the word Of God and Jesus was a Messiah Didn't you kind of have thoughts of what might happen if you if you received him and then broke the news later on?

Well, I know that my first reaction upon the realization was what will my mother say, right?

And of course those of us those who are watching us today will know that that's no light question and that We've suffered so in that name that my mother would automatically assume that I had joined the enemy's camp She wouldn't understand I knew that that this would cause her a portion of grief and consternation and my second question was What would my intellectual colleagues say at the faculty in California that I had just left where I'd been a leading radical They would mock me as insane naive naive Which is in fact what happened subsequently, but you know that When I read on it pictured Jesus bent over the earth poking his finger in the dirt And he looked up finally I pictured the face of him who had never sinned confronted by men who in a sense were anguished with him and aggravated by him and wanted him out of the way and had him in such a predicament as No human wisdom could answer and he spoke that one line with which many of us are familiar Maybe we're too familiar and with and the explosive power of it has not registered upon our hearts And that was let him who is without sin cast the first stone and Paul I can't describe what the reaction was in the reading of that line as if it lifted up off the pages and Penetrated my eyes and my brain and didn't stop there to my amazement.

My mind was everything Everything was centered and intellect.

It was my God but something began to press downward and inward in the depths of my being in my heart and Rend me and cut me through for the Word of God as the scripture says is quick and powerful Sharper than any two-edged saw to the cutting of sons of the soul in the spirit. Let me ask you question you think it might be that You you realize that when Jesus said that he was identifying every one of us and you and I included that we also were with sin and that if we were to we were to pick up a rock and Throw that thing that we would be just double condemning ourselves.

I think the reaction of His adversaries answers that question. I think the scriptures describe that one by one they turned and walked away Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. You know, of course who is there who is without sin?

You know that I had come to realization something like that some years before when I was in the service And had gone on Yom Kippur the day of atonement not to a synagogue but to Dachau the concentration camp I wanted to see for myself Something of a horror with which I thought I was already well acquainted But you know what our human problem is that we don't know as we ought to know I remember spending that day walking through those barracks because everything has been preserved as it was in that horrible time of the Holocaust.

I Walked into the barracks. They actually ran my hand over those wooden bunks. I pictured the gaunt Bodies of my people at one time herded together there. I walked down the company streets I saw the whipping post in their place.

I walked into the commandant's office and saw the exhibition tables of Photographs of mounds of hair and teeth and bodies and tattered uniforms and fragments of letters I walked into the gas room and saw the inscription in German on the wall about the strobing for a shower I saw the jets in the ceiling. I went into the gas room I saw the ovens with bones and ashes still in their places and went outside and actually touched the smokestack And when I did something just snapped In my heart and consciousness I'd more and seen more than I was able to receive and I left that day so numb and so in shock Found myself on a train being taken back to Munich although I hardly cared where and I had a most Unusual experience in that railroad compartment that day. I thought myself alone But I sensed that there was someone else in there with me and I turned and I saw a blur of a blonde head And blue eyes a typical Aryan the symbol of the master race our enemy and our persecutor I tell you Paul at such a great anger and hatred and bitterness welled up in my heart. I Wanted to turn and rend that man When I looked upon him, I saw that this poor wretch himself was a victim of that most recent war He had neither arms no legs and multiple amputee He had hooks for arms and artificial limbs for legs and he was riding in pain Trying to adjust his limbs with his hooks and he couldn't do it I had my arms folded over my chest wearing the uniform of Uncle Sam and thinking to myself suffer you dog That's only a small measure of the kind of pain that you inflicted upon my people and yet as he continued to ride I grew so uncomfortable that finally in disgust I got out of my seat I walked over without saying a word and I laid my hands upon his artificial limb to straighten it in the moment I touched it I could taste the nausea in my mouth and he beckoned by signs and gestures what I should do Until he achieved his comfort We sat down and we attempted a conversation in my broken GI Deutsch I was intently studying this man's face looking for the telltale signs of barbarism and cruelty and I saw none all I saw was the face of a man a representative man And I heard a kind of an inward voice say there but for the grace of God go you And I thought to myself if I had not been born in Brooklyn if I were not Jewish if I were not American if I were not wearing this uniform I myself am Capable of atrocity. I sensed in my heart that I was already a murderer not that I had ever committed the act But I know that I had given looks that could kill I had maimed and crippled with my mouth And that therefore I could not point a finger of accusation at any man I did not know the scripture that there's no man good no not one That we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God But I was introduced to the reality of which that scripture speaks, you know the same thing When I was over in Japan part of the occupation forces 1950 and 1951 I Took a trip to Hiroshima where the first atomic bomb was dropped And I remember going to a bridge right near the train station that was the center of the blast and I stood on that bridge and As I looked down I saw two shadows my own and somebody else's and I turned and there was nobody next to me And it was a shadow of a man who had been standing on that bridge when the bomb went off and it just indelibly Etched his shadow into the bridge and I thought the same thing There but for the grace of God go I You know, I thought exactly the same thing I looked around me and Japanese people were all over the place and here I was an American GI I was a victor and they were the vanquished And when I looked at him I thought it's really just a quirk of fate All right, I used to think that way now. I know that it's God's planning and everything but when I looked at one of those those people and I thought that could be me I could have been the enemy and And the other guy who was Japanese he could have been an American soldier. I just happened to be born American And when you're beginning I think yeah, I think the main thing there is just that It kind of brings everything down into a common denominator That people aren't the enemy just because they're they belong to a certain race or because they belong to a certain country that we could have been anyone or the other one could have been us and I Think it's so important that we realize that God as he works in our lives. He brings us together He brings us together in unity and this thing of enemy vanquished and victor and these things break down They're gone.

You know, there's a wonderful scripture in Jeremiah.

I know that you're familiar with this Comes in the 17th chapter in the 9th verse It says that the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it. I I Think that the beginning of wisdom is to begin to Understand what our own human predicament and condition is as God himself sees it and describes it in this book That until we begin to understand that the enemy is not one outside not the imperialist or the exploiter as I was so given to Express in my own adolescence and youth always thinking that someone other than myself Was at the fault for all of the unhappiness and grief that's in the world never beginning to understand that I myself In my own walk and my own relationships for something of an imperialist and an exploiter the human heart is Deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it to you truly. There's no man good No, not one and until we begin to see that we're not disposed to receive the mercy and the salvation of a God That's I'm so grateful for that experience that I had aboard that that train the experience in Dachau The growing understanding that I was being given by a God of whom I knew nothing That I might be brought to the end of my own your human arrogance and presumption you know Paul as we go from campus to campus today speaking before university audiences and Confronting the radicals of this generation I think the first message that I have for them even before the consideration of God for his own sake Is for them to begin to perceive their own condition that we're finite limited Human all too human that our appetites grow by what they feed upon as Shakespeare said That despite the kinds of vocabulary we employ the grand slogans and the phrases and the concern for brotherhood That we really don't have the capacity until God begins to work Something in our lives by his own power by the transcendent nature which is seeking entry into our own Yeah, you know if we as we go along in these telecasts it'll be interesting I think for our friends to hear some of the Different things that we come up against and some of the people we meet as we go out to various places and speak I think what I'd like to hear now is How did you how did you go from when you were on the deck of the steamer to when you really met the Lord Well, you can imagine what my reaction was when I was pierced through by the Spirit of God in the reading of scriptures I knew with great certitude in a single given moment of my life That there's a living God a moment before I was an atheist that I was reading his word I didn't know how that could be knowing that this word had passed through the hands of many translators and yet it was undeniably the record of God and Then as the word was God's Word Jesus therefore must be who he claimed to be it was a triple shock I was stunned devastated and I knew that I was been brought to a great crossroad in my life that I could not Accept this revelation into my life and continue in the same character in the same walk that I had known previously That my very kingdom was being imperiled and threatened and I was being invited into the kingdom of God But that our cats would no longer allowed be allowed to be the Lord of his own life Praise God Well, that is that is a shock for any man to consider and I have to confess that I wasn't eager to receive The import of this revelation in my life.

I actually wrestled against God For about six months following that revelation just as Jacob of old.

I spent four months in Egypt following that representing a Jewish Museum and attempting to salvage their religious and historical and artworks before it would suffer devastation in that unhappy land and Then finally in the four months there in my relationship with the Orthodox community I came finally to Israel and God brought my search to its conclusion in Jerusalem the holy city I was met in the street one day by a young Jewish man whom I'd come to know nine months earlier Leaving New York on the same ship.

He was at that time studying at the Hebrew University.

He's today a rabbi an Orthodox young man and when I told him that the Jesus of the New Testament was breathing down my neck and Of my experience in the revelation and the way that my heart was being gripped by the things which had been spoken to me He became alarmed that I might desert my ancestral faith and had me to stay with him at the university for two weeks and I read books which he put into my hands and interviews with which he arranged for me with friends and with Professors at the school The upshot was that I was to be sent to a an orthodox Hasidic community And I was put on a bus one day and never got there It's just one of those happenstances where it was a wrong bus of I had taken that bus downtown many times and I found myself lost and I walked out of that bus and into the first door that I could find seeking directions and Woman was very gracious at the counter and I was about to leave.

I noticed I was in a bookstore With my curiosity for books. I took a closer look at the titles and stopped in my tracks when I saw that the store sold Bibles Christian literature and New Testament's we used to call those circumstances It was quite a circumstance. I turned and looked at this woman's Jewish face. I said, what is this place?

Oh, she said we're a congregation of Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus and Paul something clicked in my heart in that statement And I heard a still small voice in that moment that called me by name and said Arthur not to leave I suppose that many men will say that they hear voices like that where brand one is insane I had never before heard such a voice But I know it was the same voice that Abram heard that called him out of all of the called ease away from nation kindred and father's house To follow him in the land that he would show him I intuitively recognized that this was the voice of him alone who had the right to command my Jewish allegiance You know what I did. I obeyed it I stayed four days and nights with these Jewish believers and saw in that time a quality of life and Devotion and spiritual intensity and power and prayer and depth of worship Jews with their hands above their heads Worshipping the God of Israel with tears and with Jewish confidences, which I could not put aside Real real messianic Jews. They were messianic believers and God was evidently in their lives You know, I feel like doing it I Think it'd be the apropos if we just stop right now and just thank God just For what's happened to you and what's happened to me, why don't we just How do we just tell him we we love him right now? People I hope you'll not find this strange and that week by week as we Continue as the Lord leads us in the unfolding of our own experience The light that he's given us in his word and the various personalities that will bring That you'll understand that Jews who have come to the knowledge of their God are Jews who call upon him Prayer is no longer a ceremony.

It's not a ritualistic thing. It's not an aside It's a deeply felt real experience in God. We believe that he's there.

He hears us he answers We love to sing before him to praise him and to worship him and we invite you Wherever you are spiritually as you grow in realization As your heart expands towards God as it moves God would to also raise your voice The scripture says that God inhabits the praises of his people He's not a Jew who is one outwardly the scripture says but inwardly whose circumcision is not of the flesh but of the heart Who rejoices in the Messiah Jesus and worships God in the spirit? So we're going to invite you to join with us in the spirit that there's a favorite psalm that we sing the first verse of the hundred and third psalm Let's sing it for the people we ask you not to evaluate our voices and that's not the point but just to catch a sense of our joy our Acknowledgement of a God who saves a God who is real to us as he was to Abraham Who calls men by a still small voice out of arrogance out of contemptuousness out of? Self-righteousness out of looking upon others as the enemy to see the enemy in his own heart Calls him out of convenience out of familiarity and calls him into a land that he will show him a land of promise in the land of joy Let's let's praise the Lord Bless the Lord Oh my soul Bless the Lord Oh my soul Praise God Amen You know that I heard such prayer such singing such devotion from these Jewish people I went to sleep so perplexed that last night unable to reconcile all that I'd been told and That night God ordered the things in my heart and I understood It takes a revelation of God by his spirit to understand and he'll give it to those who have a contrite and broken spirit the next morning I acted upon the basis of the things which God had given and called upon his name that first time my first prayer in 35 years and instantly something happened the spirit of anger and rebellion and bitterness went out and a ruach ha kodesh a Holy Spirit of God came in new life a new life a life which is available to every man Who will recognize and understand the call of God and obey it? Let me ask you a question Did it take a real understanding of God and how God operated how God did all of the things he did before you could call We have to know that it's his voice his authority we pray you're hearing that voice You'll tune in with us next week allow God to speak to you as he continues as a speaking God to us Thank you for joining with us Appreciate your prayer and your continuation with us as we speak the things which he's made dear to us as Jewish men God bless you and see you next week, right?
