Elijah the Prophet - Art Katz

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, I'm ready to introduce a new topic or a new prophet, for which we can say everything till now has been preparation. He's not a prophet with which one wants to begin. He's really more of a prophet with which we shall conclude.

Because Jesus said that Elijah must first come to restore all things that was true in his first coming and it shall be true also in his final coming. Elijah must come and restore all things or at least a people in the character of Elijah and Elijah people, a prophetic church in keeping with the character and ministry of Elijah himself. It's the ministry of restoration and it's a phenomenal task because a way needs to be prepared for the coming of the Lord.

The crooked, twisted, distorted way needs to be made straight. The rough places smooth. And the high mountains of human exaltation and self-assurance need to be brought down. And the equally false valleys of despondency and defeat and insecurity need to be filled up.

For the coming of the Lord and the brightness of his glory. This is the task of the church in the last days. And it must be done in the power and the authority of Elijah.

The most eminent man of God in the most wicked and corrupt age. God reserves his best for the world's worst.

And we are certainly moving toward the fulfillment of these things that we are abruptly introduced to Elijah in 1 Kings 16.

Very abrupt. No introduction at all.

Here is the man full-blown and put before us without any preparation. And he comes in an age of apostasy when all of the prophets have been slain and the authors of God have been broken down. And the people of Israel have gone whoring after other Gods. And there's a conjunction between an Ahab and a Jezebel.

The coming together of the most sinister and sensual political and religious coalition. A kind of one-world ecumenical mentality to which we are now also presently moving.

And before this formidable and fearful entity which has slain all the prophets of God stands one man in absolute assurance in God without trembling, without fear, without inward or personal contradiction. And we hear these first words as the Lord my God lives before whom I stand. It shall not reign nor do, but according to my word.

I want to clutch the edge of this podium. To keep from falling under the impact of those words. We mustn't rush this. We need to extend our seminar for another week. Just to adequately weigh and ponder these words. What an introduction of a man of God. Words that would be astounding and exceptional under any circumstance.

But multiplied in their significance in that they are spoken before Ahab. This dreaded despot in union with Jezebel. And before him the prophet stands.

The single-eyed man of God. And makes this announcement. Commanding the elements. Bringing judgment upon them. And all the surrounding world.

It shall not reign nor do.

Not even do. But according to my word. That has got to be either the most absolute and colossal egotism or exactly the same. Either the most colossal egotism or exactly the opposite. An absolute selflessness.

In which you cannot tell where the prophet ends and God begins. God's word is his word and his word is God's word. It's no longer the word of the Lord coming to the prophet. It's the word of the Lord in the prophet.

It's the word made flesh. And it's to this that we're tending. I'm feeling Shakespearean again.

That scene in Hamlet where he holds the skull of the courtiest.

The courtiest. The courtiest, excuse me. The madman of the court. Anybody remember his name? Do you remember his name? But he holds the heft of the skull in his hand. He holds the skull in his hand. And he says, where be your jibes and gambles now? Where are your wisecracks and your jokes now? Where is your charismatic fun and games now? Where are your cheap amens and hallelujahs now? Where are your cheap amens and hallelujahs now? Where are your cheap amens and hallelujahs now?

When God is bringing us to this, the incarnation of his people with the prophetic spirit of God that commands elements and stands before the most dreaded anti-Christ forces in the earth and stands before the most dreaded anti-Christ forces in the earth without trembling.

Where be your jibes and gambles now? Where are your games and your facile words now? Your conferences and your clinics. Your fun and your games. This is a solemn hour. It's an hour of restoration.

Elijah must come. Before the day of the coming of the Lord.

Must! It's a divine imperative. And I cannot say with assurance whether it's going to be a single man. And I cannot say with assurance whether it's going to be a single man. My greatest inclination is to think My greatest inclination is to think It's going to be a corporate man. My greatest inclination is to think A corporate man.

An Elijah band Over the entire earth Making straight the way for the coming of the Lord.

So I want to ask you ministers that are in the room. So I want to ask you ministers that are in the room. Are you preparing the people of God for this? Are you preparing the people of God for this? Let that sink in. Let that sink in. Let that sink in. A minute's respectful silence. A minute's respectful silence. Are you preparing the people of God for this? Are you preparing the people of God for this? To be an Elijah people. To be an Elijah people. In the intensity, the character, In the intensity, the character, The uniqueness of vision that characterizes this man. Because we are also moving toward an age of apostasy. Because we are also moving toward an age of apostasy. The falling away of the church. Where the church itself will let go.

Iniquity shall abound. And the hearts of many shall grow cold. And the hearts of many shall grow cold. And Paul said that, do not be deceived. And Paul said that, do not be deceived. The Lord shall not come. Till there first be a great falling away. Before there is a great apostasy.

The parallels between the age of Elijah and our age is stunning.

And the parallel we can make between the age of Eli, and ours, And the parallel we can make between the age of Eli, and ours, Of God-words.

There'll still be a Christian rhetoric. There'll still be a Christian rhetoric.

There'll be one great ecumenical charismatic There'll be one great ecumenical charismatic The earth will envelop the earth.

They'll be utterly deceived. They'll leap on their altars but there'll be no answer. They'll leap on their altars but there'll be no answer. But they expected an answer. Because they thought they knew God. Because they said all the right words. And were inducted in all the right phrases.

But had not the reality of God. Which is the very quintessence of the prophetic burden. Which is the very quintessence of the prophetic burden.

And indeed they were unwilling to hear it or to receive it. And indeed they were unwilling to hear it or to receive it. It's an age which destroys the prophets. It's an age which destroys the prophets.

That Elijah can say, I alone am left. That Elijah can say, I alone am left.

To choose a vocation like this or to choose to be chosen To choose a vocation like this or to choose to be chosen Is to sign your death warrant. Is to sign your death warrant. I'm not expecting to end in a bed. I'm not expecting to end in a bed. Indeed I'll be disappointed. But I know that there's a logic to my life. But I know that there's a logic to my life. That brings me to a modest course. And it's not the world that I fear. It's religion.

In this age of apostasy Elijah says, As the Lord my God lives before whom I stand.

He knew him as the living God. It wasn't a piece of cheap phraseology. It was something inwrought in the depths of the experience of the man. He's a man with a personal history in God. That's my only credential to stand before you. And I've never been a student in a Bible school. And I've never been a student in a Bible school. I've never attended a seminary. I've never even gone through a discipleship training school. I've never even gone through a discipleship training school.

Thomas is praying for me. Thomas is praying for me.

I have only one credential. A certain volume of experience in God. A certain volume of experience with and in God. Most of which has been painful. Before it became glorious.

I know that my Lord lives.

Because He's feeding 55 of us every day. Up in a remote location in North America in a community. That has no organizational connections. For which none of us receive any salary. Or have personal income. Or bank accounts. Or insurance policies. Over seven years now.

We've been fed by ravens.

And I'm doing pretty well. You see the beautiful three-piece suit I wore last night? It was a gift. See these shoes? I got them in Africa as a gift. See this watch? A Lebanese saint. Got it in Germany. Because I had given my own watch away in Czechoslovakia only some weeks before. I saw this man sitting with his arms folded as I was speaking there in Germany. And my eyes fell on his watch.

And the Lord said, that's your watch.

He came up to me after the meeting.

He said, the Lord has spoken to me that I'm to give you my watch.

I just bought it. It has an alarm clock and everything. So I've got it. So I've got it. According to the definition of the United States government, we live beneath the poverty line. Our income is so infinitesimal that we have no requirement even to pay income tax. Yet we own our own airplane. We have our own pilot. Who is also a mechanic. Also our printer. Whose wife is a nurse. They receive no salary. We live together every day. Many problems. Unspeakable trials and aggravations. No one can cause you greater hurt than saints themselves. But they are often the very hurts that we need.

If the Lord is to cut in order that he might heal.

I could take days to speak on this subject.

But just to suggest that I know that my Lord lives.

I know it even in these days. That I should come here after two months of travel through Africa and Egypt and Israel. Without time for preparation. Or even thought. Not knowing what to find or to expect.

And to see the day by day unfolding of God that we have been experiencing. And to see the day by day unfolding of God that we have been experiencing. I know that my God lives.

To go to bed last night without knowing what I'd be speaking this morning. Too tired to give it any consideration. It has not to do with me anyway. And then to hear these words this morning.

I know that my God lives.

That knowledge is not cheap. It costs something.

To cast yourself upon such a God.

To trust him for your provision. Both spiritual as well as material. To welcome the dealings of God in your life. However painful. However humiliating. To enter into another realm of glory. That you can stand before a whole unbelieving generation. That you can stand before a whole unbelieving generation. That has only its cheap religious rhetoric and phraseology. That has only its cheap religious rhetoric and phraseology.

And say, I know that my God lives. And say, I know that my God lives. Before whom I stand.

That's a precious phrase.

Can you see why prophetic texts need to be spoken by prophetic persons?

This is not for teachers. There needs to be something here that lies too deep for words. There needs to be an emanation, a spirit of something coming forth. I'm glad you're French speaking so you can understand me when I say that this is like a rare wine. I can't use that metaphor with the American Coca-Cola audience.

A phrase like, before whom I stand.

That doesn't need to be exegeted. That needs to be savored. Like a rare wine on the tongue. You don't want to suck this down quickly. This needs to linger. The fragrance of it needs to go up into your nostrils. You need to feel those prickly dots that come up into your senses. This is resonant. Of a life lived before God. What does that mean? It is so distinctly different from anything that we understand as Christians. That has only to do with the attendance at Sunday services.

As the Lord lives before whom I stand.

Who of us can say that? And what will it take before we can say it? And whatever it takes must be fulfilled.

Or the Lord will not come. We need to hasten the day of his appearing.

I say again, it's not a fixed chronological event. It's waiting upon us. Our maturity as sons and daughters of God.

Who are making straight the way for his coming. In the bringing of the church to maturity. That it can say. As the Lord my God lives before whom I stand.

I don't stand before men. As if I crave their approval. And need their assurance. I'm impervious to their compliments. As I am to their scathing condemnation. There's only one voice that you crave to hear. The voice of him with whom you have to do. This is my servant in whom I am well pleased. It's the only voice you hear.

Who is more blind or deaf than my servant Israel.

Don't look at their faces. And don't listen for their compliments. Their seductive flattery. Or their condemnation or contempt. I wish I had Adala for every time I was told that I'm destroying the unity of the body of Christ. It almost invariably comes at Catholic Charismatic Conferences. It almost invariably comes at Catholic Charismatic Conferences. Excuse me for that. It just happens.

That God gives me fearful things to say.

About golden calves and eating drinking and rising up to play. About golden calves and eating drinking and rising up to play.

And not waiting for the holy thing to come down the mount. And not waiting for the holy thing to come down the mount. Brought down by the prophet of God in God's own time. Brought down by the prophet of God in God's own time.

And that I cannot give myself to these Jesus rallies. Where they wear shorts and crack gum and having a great ball. Where they wear shorts and crack gum and having a great ball.

And when they ask me to speak, I speak what the Lord gives.

And there's a bit of a tremor and a shock. And yet strangely it brings some people to life. But always without exception. But always without exception. Some condescending charismatic leader will come and take me aside privately later. Some condescending charismatic leader will come and take me aside privately later. Brother, I need to tell you.

You're really injuring the unity of the body of Christ.

You went and burst our little bubble. You went and burst our little bubble. In our ecumenical unity. And I love it. And I love it. Because I'm jealous for the real thing. And not the facsimile thereof. Do we think that this unity is going to be obtained because there's a big canvas banner with a dove on it? And we should embrace men with their turnaround collars and call them brother. And we should embrace men with their turnaround collars and call them brother. And we should embrace men with their turnaround collars and call them brother.

Whose churches have murdered the true saints of God since time immemorial.

That the blood of the apostles Paul have run right through France and Switzerland.

And that these crimes have never been acknowledged before God and men.

Never been repented of.

And you speak now of unity.

Of the body of Christ. It's a false ecumenism.

And if a prophet is anything.

He stands for the truth.

And will not give himself to the counterfeit.

No matter how beguiling men are. Or how fierce their criticism.

That you're destroying the unity of the body.

Indeed there's something that needs to be destroyed. Locked up and rooted out and destroyed. If there's to be a true building and a plant there. And there's only one kind of a man who will stand for this.

It's the man who will say as my God lives. Before whom I stand. That's why God doesn't give us any introduction to Elijah.

The world would not be great enough to contain the books. You can only imagine what it takes. To prepare a man like this.

Of whom I stand.

To prepare a man like this.

Of whom we are told in James that he was flesh and blood like as we.

I want to destroy something right now in you. Any romantic notion that you have that these men were made of different stuff than we. That's a lie. But it's a lie that you want to encourage and dwell in.

Because it absolves you from the responsibility to be the Elijah for your generation.

You think well they were extraordinary. And I'm just ordinary. And I can't of course assume that to be such as they. You're not getting away that easily. God has called you to more than a seminar. He's called you to the reality. To be a prophetic people. An Elijah people. To work the work of restoration. To destroy the pluck up and root out. So that we can build and plant.

How discreet the Lord is to just draw the shade over the life of Elijah. How discreet is the Lord to just put a veil on the life of Elijah.

The extraordinary dealings of God. All his extraordinary interventions in his life. How many times was he left broken and despairing and repentant and dissolved in his own tears. How many times was he left broken and dissolved in his own tears. How many times has he failed God in disappointment. How many times has he failed God in disappointment. What does it take to learn the lessons of obedience. How does one come to such an acute hearing of the still small voice. How does one come to such an acute hearing of the still small voice. It cannot take place in a day. So I repeat again to the leaders of the church that are here. What are you doing to prepare your people for this? How much beyond Sunday services we need to go. How much beyond Sunday services we need to go. How much beyond Sunday services we need to see what our first purpose of life is. How much beyond Sunday services we need to see what our first purpose of life is. To be Gods. To be yielded to him. To be abandoned to him. To do his will. To seek first his kingdom. To break the powers of the deception. To have made the faith a secondary and a supplementary phenomenon. To have made the faith a secondary and a supplementary phenomenon. A Sunday addendum to our busy life. A Sunday addendum to our busy life. That we've allowed ourselves to be seduced by the universities. That we've allowed ourselves to be seduced by the universities. And the emphasis on profession. And the emphasis on profession. And you've got to make a living. And all the things that pertain to prestige and pride. And all the things that pertain to prestige and pride.

In which you have become so ensconced. In which you have become so ensconced.

Take it off. That your life in Christ is supplementary. That your life in Christ is supplementary. Rather than first and foremost. Rather than first and foremost. A mere Sunday phenomenon. A mere Sunday phenomenon. What a caricature. Of God's intention. But we sing it beautifully. But we sing it beautifully.

Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Seek ye first the kingdom of God.

And his righteousness. But we don't do it. But we don't do it.

Seek ye first.

But we don't do it. And all through this trip we share about our community experience. And all through this trip we share about our community experience.

Out of which has come the revelation of the kingdom of God. Out of which has come the revelation of the kingdom of God.

Not as some ephemeral and abstract thing. Not as some ephemeral and abstract thing. But as practical possibility. But as practical possibility. As the earth will appear here as it is in heaven. Here on earth as it is in the sky. By going from house to house daily breaking bread. By going from house to house daily breaking bread. By having morning prayer meeting together. By having morning prayer meetings together.

And by giving the lord the best and first part of our day. And by giving the lord the best and first part of our day. Until he shall release us. Until he shall release us.

No session less than two and half hours. No session less than two and half hours. Its confrontation, its existential dealing. Its confrontation, its existential dealing.

Its the word of God given in the context of our life and experience. Its the word of God given in the context of our life and experience.

Its the foundation for community. Its the foundation for community. And the changing of our character in life. And the transformation, the change of our character in our life. And a man will come up to me afterwards and say Oh Artie said I would love to meet on a daily basis with other believers in prayer like that. And a man comes to me after having spoken about this and says Oh I would like to be able to meet believers like this and be able to live with them like this. But my house is in the suburbs. But my house is in the suburbs. And I'm too far away from where the other saints live. And I'm too far away from where the other saints live. And I'm too far away from where the other saints live. So I tell him Move! Move!

Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Seek ye first the kingdom of God.

Or another one will come and say Well I'm an engineer, I'm a professional businessman and I don't have the time for that kind of giving myself to the body of Christ. And I say to him Change your job. Give up your career. Simplify your lifestyle. Work fewer hours. Establish the first priority. His kingdom come. You can understand why the phrase is so important. The phrase is so important. The phrase is so important. The phrase is so important. The phrase is so important. The phrase is so important.

You can understand why the phrase is repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. You can understand why it is said repent when the kingdom of God is near. It will never come.

Though it's burgeoning and pulsating and waiting to break forth. Even though it's burgeoning and waiting to break forth. Even though its impulsion of life is there it only waits for one thing to break.

Until we ourselves first repent.

Not the world we. For our Sunday Christianity. We repent of our Sunday Christianity. The shabbiness of our religious life. All this ease, all this poverty of our religious life.

With our placid satisfaction of this short of the glory of God. And our placid satisfaction of what comes below what God desires.

That we have learned to live without that glory. We are trained to live without that glory.

And think that it is normative. And believe that it is the norm.

And measure religious success by numbers. And measure religious success by numbers. And whether the services were good. And whether the services were good.

We need to repent.

For falling short of the glory of God. For falling short of the glory of God. And not believing for a kingdom come. And not believing for a kingdom come. I hadn't planned to say any of these things. I hadn't planned to say any of these things.

I have written in my margin alongside where it says before whom I stand. I have written in my margin alongside where it says before whom I stand.

And you need to write it in your margin. And you need to write it in your margin. That this is a life lived deliberately. That this is a life lived deliberately. And consciously. For God. In his presence. A deliberate conscious living of ones life for God. A deliberate conscious living of ones life for God. Not for oneself. Not for oneself. This alone is revolutionary. This alone challenges and controversy the whole egocentric theme of modern civilization. This alone challenges and controversy the whole egocentric theme of modern civilization.

Which has come even into the church.

Whether we like the services. Whether we enjoy the song service. Whether we enjoy the preaching. Whether we like the pastor.

Whether we have received benefit from coming. Whether we have been fed by our coming.

Everything is predicated in terms of us. Everything is predicated in terms of us. Our satisfaction. Our delight. Our benefit. The egocentrism of the world. The egocentrism of the world. Living for one's own self. Living for one's own self.

Is the cancer also of the church. Is the cancer also of the church.

And needs to be ruthlessly excised, cut out and leveled. And needs to be ruthlessly excised, cut out and leveled.

By God's prophetic people. By God's prophetic people.

Are you consciously living your life for God? Are you consciously living your life for God?

That's how the great apostolic life begins. That's how the great apostolic life begins.

Paul knew how to ask the right question. Paul knew how to ask the right question. Lord, and he said it with trembling. And he said it with trembling. Not the facile glib way in which we say it. Not the facile glib way in which we say it. Lord, one who has total authority over me. You who have total authority over me. In everything. What would you have for me to do? What would you have for me to do? How many of us have ever dared once ask that question? How many of us would ever dare now to ask that question? How many of us would even dare now to ask that question?

Lest we would hear to our horror that what we are doing is not his will.

No, he never called you to business. No, he never called you to a profession. Never called you to a profession. No, he never called you to ministry. Never called you to marriage. It's something you chose. Without even consulting. Without even considering. You assumed. Well, one has to make a living. God needs doctors. Of course it's natural to be married.

And so that God would come afterwards and bless what you have chosen.

We're guilty, children. For sinful presumption before God. In virtually everything. Because the question, what would you have for me to do?

Is not the question that is asked only at the inception of the apostolic prophetic life.

It's the question in which our lives are created. It's the question in which our life needs daily to be lived. Hourly. Moment by moment. What would you have for me to do? Have you the faith to ask it?

And to believe that God could answer. That indeed that he has a will.

A purpose. Might be contrary to your own.

And that indeed he will express it.

If he sees a heart that has vacated its own desires.

And will do the will of God that is revealed. Get thee to the Brooks Sherrith. I've commanded the ravens to feed thee there. From here and go to the Toran of Kerit.

Which is in front of the Jordan.

And there I have ordered the ravens to feed you. And he went and did according to the word of the Lord.

No ifs, no ands, no buts. Surely he should have asked a few Jewish questions. For which we Jews are famous. Is that really God or is that Satan? Because the raven is a bird of, it's an unclean bird. It's the kind of thing that feeds on dead and rotting things.

Surely God will not select that as an instrument for feeding you. Contradicts all that I understand about God.

Exactly. There's nothing that God delights in more. Than contradicting your French, Swiss, German understanding.

So he arose and went.

Which is, and American. Because I'm not offended by that. Because I don't represent that nationality. Because I'm not offended by that. Because I don't represent that nationality. Or that culture. Something far more transcendent. A heavenly. Something celestial.

So he arose and went and did. So he went and did according to the word of the Lord.

Do you love those words? If you have anything to do with my burial will you put that on my tombstone? If you have anything to do with my burial will you put those words on my tombstone? My stone was born in Brooklyn, New York. February 13th, 1929. Died in Lausanne, Switzerland. Died in Lausanne, Switzerland. November. Stoned by women. Stoned by women. And then this one inscription. And then this one inscription. And then this one inscription. And then this one inscription.

So he arose and went and did. He arose and went and did according to the word of the Lord. According to the word of the Lord.

No ifs, no ends, nobody. No explanations required. You know that's how my life and God began? You know that's how my life and God began? 18 years ago in Jerusalem. I walked into a Christian bookstore as a Jewish atheist. I walked into a Christian bookstore as a Jewish atheist. In Jerusalem. And I was stunned to find that they were selling Bibles and New Testaments. And I was stunned to find that they were selling Bibles and New Testaments. And I asked the Jewish woman who was there, all surprised, what is this? Oh she said innocently, this is our bookstore adjoining our chapel. Oh she said innocently, this is our bookstore adjoining our chapel. We're a congregation of Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus. We're a congregation of Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus. And in that moment I heard a voice. And in that moment I heard a voice. The voice of him with whom I have to do. The voice of him with whom I have to do. A still small voice. A small and sweet voice. That I had not heard throughout all of my contentious adult life. That I had not heard throughout all of my contentious adult life. That I had not heard throughout all of my contentious adult life. So long filled with my own rhetoric and humanistic slogans. So long filled with my own rhetoric and humanistic slogans. My Marxism, my ideologies. My Marxism, my ideologies. But when all that was stilled. But when all that was stilled. I heard a voice. Calling me by name. And commanding me to remain there. And commanding me to remain there. And I obeyed. And I obeyed. I left 4 days later. Saved. Saved.

So he arose and he went and he did. According to the word of the Lord.

And this is my only credential before you.

18 years of arising and going and doing according to the word of the Lord.

And I can't tell you how many times we have moved. From California to New York, to Kansas City, to New York, to Denmark, to Israel, to New Jersey, to Minnesota. Where people dwelling in tents. And it's disrupted the life of my children. And my wife doesn't like that. And I had to announce to her 7 years ago, God is calling us to Minnesota to live in community with other saints. And I had to announce to her 7 years ago, God is calling us to live in community in Minnesota, in the North of the United States with other saints. At that time we had a beautiful 17 room house in New Jersey. At that time we had a beautiful 17 room house in New Jersey. A gothic masterpiece. A gothic masterpiece. Privacy. All the private life we could desire. Two vintage Volvo cars. Two beautiful Volvo.

And the Lord said, arise and go.

To this nothing location. We were living 20 miles away from New York City. Two and a half million Jews. The true and the effectual Jerusalem of the modern world. And the Lord brought us up to Northern Minnesota. Nothing there but Indians. And woods. And I had to listen to the reproaches of Christians. And I had to listen to the reproaches of Christians. What are you doing? Copping out? Is this a flight from reality? What are you doing up there? You're running away from reality. You're right at the doorstep of the Jewish community. You're right at the doorstep of the Jewish community. What are you going to do? Run up to the woods and play cowboys and Indians? What are you going to do? You're going to climb up there to play cowboys and Indians? And I could answer them not a word. And I could answer them not a word.

Because the Lord did not give me a word. Because the Lord did not give me a word.

Of explanation.

Only arise and go. Only arise and go.

Will you go when it contradicts your logic? Are you ready to go when it contradicts your logic? Your reason? What you think God would ask? What you think God would ask? And your wife has not seen the vision? And your wife has not seen the vision? Or heard that voice? Or heard that voice?

It has come only to the head of the body? It has come only to the head of the body?

And she says to you, did God really say that? And she says, did God really say that? And comes into this demanding lifestyle. And comes into this demanding lifestyle. Where her pots and pans are going to be borrowed and not returned. Where her pots and pans are going to be borrowed and not returned. And the children's bicycles are broken. And that the bike of your children is broken. And the mud of the saints is crammed into your carpets. And the mud of the saints is crammed into your carpets. And your privacy invaded. And the time of your husband absorbed. And the blood of your husband absorbed. Did God say that? Did God say that? And I had to stand for that moment. And I had to stand for that moment. And asked myself Lord did you say that? Because I would even say it was still a small voice. Because I would even say it was still a small voice. To say that it was a whisper would be an exaggeration. I would say more an intimation. The faintest intimation of God. So that it almost becomes a matter of whether you will choose to hear it. When it calls you to a radical obedience. And a costly obedience. Unto inconvenience and more. Even the wrath and the displeasure of your wife. Will you choose to hear then? The still, still, still, small, small, small, small. You know what my experience has been?

The most radical requirements of God to me. Have not come with a loud voice out of heaven.

Because what kind of obedience does that require? There's no question about that.

God has spoken you do it.

No matter what. But he brings you into an extraordinary tension. It's the tension of the kingdom. Which is an utterly voluntary phenomenon.

It cannot be compelled of men.

The kingdom is not made by forced conscripts. But those who will choose to be chosen.

Choose to hear. Choose to arise and to go. Because they have believed that God has spoken.

Even when it's contrary to reason. To security. To one's own flesh. That kind of hearing is not born in a day. It needs to be cultivated. Nurtured. Day by day. In a school of obedience.

In which the prophets of God are trained.

Do you have such a sensitive ear? No accident that the blood of the priest was upon the ear and the thumb and the foot. Reserved for God only. Not what men want to speak. If you play your cards right brother. I can see a prominent ministry for you ahead. You just need to be a little bit more tactful. More diplomatic. But with your personality. And your remarkable gifts. I can see that God could bring you to a prominent place in our movement. Not the kingdom, our movement. You need to reserve the ear only for him.

Go to the brook sheriff. I've commanded the ravens to feed you there. He arose and he went and he did. According to the word of the Lord.

That's why when the word comes out of the mouth of such a man. It comes with a distinct authority and power. Because he who has cherished the word. And lived only by the word.

That when the hour comes that he shall speak the word.

One whose life has been immersed in the word. Brings it forth with a power and an authority. Unknown to those who have not lived in that obedience. To the word. You want to turn this seminar into an event? That could potentially shake the nations from which you come? Ask God a question today. What would you have for me to do?

And prepare yourself to believe for an answer.

And when it comes. However foolish. However demanding and costly. However insanely sacrificial.

Arise and go and do.

You say, but brother, what if I really have mistaken the word? It's really not God. It's not God. You say, but brother, what if I really have mistaken the word? It's really not God. And I ruin the security of my family. And my religious reputation.

Better to err believing that it's God's word.

By doing it.

Than to err in remaining where you are.

In the thought that you've not heard it. The capacity to hear isn't the proportion of our willingness to do. And our capacity to hear is proportional to our willingness to do.

That's why the prophet is led in such intimate detail by the Lord. That's why the prophet is led in such intimate details by the Lord. God recognizes that he indeed is a man. Because God sees and recognizes that here, in truth, there is a man.

Perhaps only one in the earth. Of all the millions professing to be Christians. Who lives by every word that proceeds out of my mouth.

Because it came to pass in the process of time that the brook dried up.

Because with time the torrent of Kerit has dried up. And don't you think Elijah saw it? Day by day. That the brook was becoming a trickle. That there was a devastating drought in the land. And how long can a man go without water?

Shouldn't we use the mind that God gave him? God didn't ask us to abdicate our minds. And begin to make other arrangements for himself. And think and analyze what are the prospective possibilities.

Because you can see that the brook is drying up. And logic itself will tell you that you've got to move and do something.

But he does not move by circumstances. But he does not move by circumstances. He does not move by what he sees. He does not walk by sight. He walks only by faith. In the word that comes from the Lord. He does not live by circumstances.

By conditions.

But by the word of the Lord.

Is this how you live? Because I want to tell you. The brook is drying up.

It shall even come to Switzerland.

Yes, it will shock you. But the brook can dry up here also. Oh, you've lived well for generations.

But I tell you in the authority of God.

That the brook which has sustained you for so long. Is going to be dried up over the earth.

As the judgment of God.

How will you live in that day? If you have been living by circumstance. The condition of the Swiss franc. The health of the economy. Your retirement pension. Your husband's career. Or any other such physical and earthly circumstances.

And not by the word of God. That's why I say that a prophet has a history in God.

See, I was born in 1929. It was the year of the great crash. I won't say that my birth brought it. But I grew up in that phenomenon. I know what physical want means. I had no father. I know what physical want means. I had no father. My mother had to eke out the barest living. A big birthday celebration with chocolate pudding. Three spoons for one bowl. And those memories remain. And I praise God for them. Because I'm in a far more privileged position than my own children. Who have only grown up in an age of affluence. Easy come, easy go. I have no respect for value. Because they have not had opportunity to learn it. When the crash comes now. For how many will their lives utterly collapse? Not just economically, but morally. Because they have not been prepared for the devastation. Because they have not been prepared for the devastation. And so to come from that kind of beginning and to become a professional teacher as I had been 18 years ago. A couple of university degrees and established in my career. And annual wage increases and retirement benefits. Medical insurance.

And the Lord says, arise and go.

Leave the teaching profession. I've called you to my service. Jewish missions. 100 dollars a week. And all the tracts you can eat. My wife was pregnant. We had a nice little house in California. I had a flourishing little ministry even in the school. Even my minister said you'd be a fool to go. Look how God is using you where you are.

But the voice of the Lord came.

Go. And we left. And we no longer had the assurances and the securities of being in a teaching profession. But now we had the security of a mission organization. Large and well established.

And four years later the Lord said arise and go.

And leave this organization. And establish your own ministry.

So we arose and went. And the Lord miraculously provided.

I didn't need the weekly income that came from an organization. I didn't need the weekly income that came from an organization. I didn't need the weekly income that came from an organization. The Lord was able to support my family.

And eight years ago the Lord said arise and go.

Into a community situation. And for over seven years he's been providing for 55 souls every day. Are you arising and going? Are you being led from brook to brook? Not looking down on the circumstances. That even when you're a teacher. Or even working in an organization. Your sustenance does not come from men. Nor from the world. But from God. You need to see that now. It's prophetic seeing. Therefore it doesn't matter whether it's this brook or that. It doesn't matter whether it's ravens or a widow. These are only the instrumentalities.

But you are living by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.

And what if the word doesn't come? And daily you watch the brook drying up. It shrivels to nothing. And you hear the screeching voice of your wife. Or the clamoring of your children. Where's your responsibility as a father? You should be providing. Can't you see the brook is drying? You should be finding some other arrangement. You know what Job said?

Ye though he slay me.

Yet will I trust him. You know what true faith is? Apostolic and prophetic faith? It's the willingness to perish alongside of a brook. That has completely dried up. But you will not move.

Because the word of the Lord has not come.

And you will not move by any other means. Even though it kill you. That is prophetic faith.

And the foundation of the church.

Which needs to be restored. By men who know it in their experience.

And can stand before the Ahab of this world. That Ahab Jezebel coalition.

That is the epitome of everything that is sensual and earthly and carnal. That is the epitome of everything that is sensual and earthly and carnal. The whipped cream cakes of the world and security and all that the world majors in.

Because the false prophets ate at Jezebel's table. While the true prophet prefers to perish by the side of a brook.

Daniel refused to eat from the king's table. And that's a key to breaking that earthly and sensual connection. With the whole world and its system of inducements and beguilements and temptations. Even in its caffeine and its coffee and its coca cola and its chocolate. Which if it was ruthlessly removed from us. We would have tremors and shakes like drug addicts. Needing to fix. We would sell our souls for a chocolate. We would sell our souls for a chocolate.

So deeply impaled are we in the world today. And to stand before the Ahab Jezebel.

The power of all these things.

And say as the Lord my God lives. Before whom I stand. And it shall not rain nor dew but according to my word. And God honors such a word. For it is God's own word. And comes as a judgment upon the entire earthly worldly religious economic system.

Is the collision course toward which we are tending. And for which we need to be prepared. It's an exceptional calling.

It must come.

And restore all things.

Jesus is pent up contained in the heavens.

Until the restoration of all things. True faith. True obedience. Living by the word of God. Seeking first the kingdom of heaven. It's an exceptional calling.

And requires an exceptional preparation.

To those who lend themselves. That they might be prepared by God. I know that I have more time. But I don't know if you can take more. I'm afraid that one rich thing is going to press and push out of consideration another. I had hoped to go further but I... You can't rush this. This needs to seep into our spirit. You can't rush this. This needs to seep into our spirit. This needs to seep into our spirit. And not just be a kind of Bible study. About some kind of quaint personality that lived in some distant time. About some kind of quaint personality that lived in some distant time. This is a word coming to us. And it confronts us in every point in particular. And it confronts us in every detail. It brings us into a radical collision with all that we thought conventional and appropriate. It offers us another definition of what believing means. More than we had ever previously considered. Or want to consider. Even now. I don't want to rush this. Because the stakes are so enormous.

God doesn't want to send us home with new ideas or concepts in our head.

We should be more impressive in our coffee time conversation. He's wanting to raise up an Elijah people. And we need to be confronted by the word that's coming. It's not just a word about Elijah. It's a word that is coming to us prophetically.

That is saying arise and go.

Leave that security. Break the connections with that system.

Prefer to cast yourself upon my word.

Even in a wilderness place. By the provision that I will send. However much it offends your own categories.

And God is needing to hear a yes.

Because this is not a compulsory thing. We need to choose to be chosen. Many called. But few who choose to be chosen. This is too great a requirement. They don't mind being Christian. And being faithful in church services. And the midweek Bible study. But this. That challenges my security. The equivalent of my 17 room house. That threatens the tranquility of my family, my marriage. The esteem of my colleagues. Do I dare risk this? Can I really say Lord. What would you have for me to do?

And have the faith even to believe that you're hearing that.

And that you'll answer. In the way that pleases you. Contrary to any thought of my own. And that you'll speak to me only on the condition. That when I hear the word that comes from your mouth.

I'll arise, I'll go, and I'll do.

The greatest source of despondency for men like me.

Is to feel that we only bring a pleasant sound.

Some kind of flirtation in the word for God's people. But that they're not changed by it.

But they do not receive it as God's own word.

And they dismiss it somehow as a message. That is painful. I pray it will not be so in these days. There's an idea whose time has come. There's a moment that has come.

For the restoration of all things spoken by God's holy prophet.

The restoration of the prophetic ministry itself.

The church itself as the prophetic presence of God in the earth.

And Elijah people.

Who can stand before the Ahab, Jezebel world. In all that is false.

Ecumenically and in every way. And say without trembling.

As the Lord my God lives. Before whom I consciously and deliberately stand.

Whose purpose is my purpose. Whose word is my word.

It shall not rain. To bring the word of judgment.

To bring the destructive word. That it might bring the word of life and building.

Elijah must come. He must come. Before the coming of the Lord. And every day that that coming is delayed.

How many more rapes? How many more child molestation? How many horrors inflicted by men upon men? How many men descending into homosexuality? How much more looting and pillage and destruction and riot and bloodshed and war? How many more tens of thousands being carted away to mental institutions? How many more thousands of abortions? How many greater insanities and deaths?

Waiting for the Lord to come forth out of Zion?

And the nations to go up to Jerusalem.

Because the word of the Lord has come.

And men shall beat their pruning hooks into plowshares.

Because the Lord has come.

A king has come. To rule and reign in the earth. Together with his people. In the kingdom that has been prepared. By those who believe for it. On the earth as in heaven.

And have prepared the way for his coming.

There's a task before us. And our reluctance and our unwillingness. To delay it but so much as one day. Fills the earth with that much more madness. That much more rape. That much more devastation.

We need to hasten the day of the coming of the Lord. Elijah must come. Let's pray for that.

I feel that I shouldn't myself pray this.

And then invite you to follow with your own prayers.

That you should pray this? That I feel that I should not.

But you yourself respond to God. And pray for this greatly needed thing.

A people, an Elijah people. In that same character. In that same single-eyed devotion. That same absoluteness of faith and obedience.

That must come. Pray for it.

In your churches. In your nation. In yourselves.
