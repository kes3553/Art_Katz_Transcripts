The Sinfulness of Sin - Art Katz

And the text is Psalm 51, which is not often considered. I wonder if it's ever considered at all, that David passed through such a searing time in the revelation of his own condition as a sinner and gave us such a statement as he has of the anatomy of repentance and contrition and brokenness, such as not to be found elsewhere in Scripture. That it's David himself who is doing it is a remarkable phenomenon, because this is Israel's king and the sweet singer of Israel and the beloved of God, lamenting and ruining the fact that he had fallen into adultery and into murder. And what's more, after he had committed those heinous sins and crimes, was not at all perturbed about it until the prophet had to tell him a little story of a man who was wronged and took advantage of someone weak and usurped his single lamb, something like that, and then said, Thou ought the man. And he was stabbed through, and that opened a whole floodgate of recognition of the magnitude of his sin.

So why am I saying all that?

This deserves supreme attention, because we are, all of us, living beneath the recognition of sin, the iniquity of sin and the terror of sin. And if you miss it there, you miss it everywhere. Everything rises and falls with the recognition of the enormity and the magnitude of what sin itself is. And if sin is lessened and made trivial and not even recognized as sin or as evil, everything else suffers loss.

What then does atonement mean? What is the cross?

What is Christ and his work if there's not a formidable thing that needs to be overcome through his death? But if we don't think it's formidable, then the whole thing falls into a little patsy pablum of easily quoted doctrines and statements and corresponding choruses, as we've heard tonight, without real penetration or conviction, and dooms us to the lamentable, pathetic culture that we are.

We've got to go back to the great issue of sin.

There may be other texts that would lend themselves to it, and maybe the Lord will employ it between today, tonight, and tomorrow, but I know that we have to begin tonight with Psalm 51, just before I pray. How many people have only a scant remembrance of that Psalm?

Yeah, okay, good, see?

Okay, what then can you know about the truth of your own condition if you've not seen it in David?

If David could fall to such unbelievable depths of what are we not capable?

And the fact that you have not fallen, is that a proof that you have a higher moral quality than King David? Or you have been spared by circumstance and you have not had to face temptations of a comparable kind?

See what I mean?

These things are written for our ratification. So Lord, we're asking Holy Ghost exposition of this remarkable cry, Lord. God forbid that we should read it and handle it in such a way as to reinforce our present shallowness, and that would be a facetious mishandling of the Word, and that we ourselves should not be stricken. The only appropriate response to that great cry is our own cry. So I'm asking my God for that Holy Ghost assistance that only you can give, that you did not think it extravagant to withhold Israel's chiefest king and the one whom you called beloved and a man after your own heart, and allow him to fall in such a pattern of disgrace, of transgression and iniquity, that would serve to instruct every successive generation since, that we have not been instructed, is a lamentable statement of our present condition, our neglect of your Word, and other things that you know only too well. So Lord, come, precious God, and let your Word penetrate us into our deeds. Show us what the vile thing is, transgression, sin, iniquity, my God, evil, and that there's no man good, no man exempt, and that if we have missed such humiliation and embarrassing conditions, it's only circumstance, chance, and that you're waiting for the greater acknowledgement on our part that does not wait to fall into those sins in order to acknowledge them. So we give you praise, glory, and honor, Lord. As we turn to this holy text, out of the anguish of the soul of your beloved David, in Jesus' name, amen. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy. Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you alone have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment. Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me. You desire truth in the inward being parts. Therefore, teach me wisdom in my secret heart. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness. Let the bones that you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me. Do not cast me away from your presence. Do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit. Then will I teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you. Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your deliverance. O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. For you have no delight in sacrifice. If I were to give a burnt offering, you would not be pleased. The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart. O God, you will not despise. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure.

Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

Then you will delight in right sacrifices and burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings. Then bulls will be offered on your altar.

Amen.

Well, if mercy is for us only an academic acknowledgement and something that we assume that we have received in salvation, but is not the cogent blessing for which David is crying out of its depths in order to receive, we have nothing to say and nothing to offer the Jew in their last days' extremity. See, I have a vested interest in the things that issue from this whole awareness of our own desperate condition, our own depravity, or else we just present to them a bunch of smug religionists.

What's the word? Priggish.

We are just religious prigs who are smug and self-satisfied. And we'll look down upon Jews with a certain kind of spiritual superiority and completely miss the historic encounter for which God is presently moving. We will not be in a position to extend mercy because the fact of the matter is we have never received it. You only receive mercy when you are at wit's end and utterly desperate in the awareness of a condition that if God does not meet it, you're finished, you're a dead duck, you cannot go on, you're burning with shame, you cannot bear to remember your iniquity and to remember that you performed it in God's sight. He says that, that against you alone have I sinned and done with his evil in your sight. You were there when I handled another man's wife and undressed her and sank my fingers into her flesh and more and did not cringe and even forgot that I'm not to covet my neighbor's wife, which is one of the Ten Commandments, and that the book of Proverbs are full that the touch of another man's wife is to welcome death. David somehow was oblivious to what he should have known as the sweet singer of Israel, oblivious to the command, so intoxicated with the beauty of this woman, so having to have this rapturous delight that he did not even think that God was somehow aware, let alone present and seeing. Think on that, you saints. Maybe you're guilty of the same thing. Do you think that God knows when you take liberties and pull a boo-boo? When you lie, when you're deceitful, when you harbor in your heart thoughts that ought not to be there, or other practices or speech or conduct that is unbecoming to a saint that he's not aware? Think of what sin is. Sin is a remarkable presumption against God. What it's saying is, you're not really God. You're not really all-seeing and omniscient and all-knowing and all-present. Therefore, I can take this liberty and cut this corner and do this satisfying thing, because you're not there to observe it. To say that God is not there is to say that God is not God.

Got the point?

So we are daily denying God as God and come here in the evening and watch the overhead projector and sing all these songs about His embrace.

What shall I call it? Pap?

It's not that the innocuous language of these songs does not condemn them in themselves, but that we're singing them as if we're in that relationship when we're every day and almost hour by hour violating the most essential acknowledgment of God as God.

I think we can sing our way through that, talk about an embrace.

We're heaping insult upon injury and defaming God as if not only was He not there when we acted deceitfully, but as if He's not here when we're singing deceitfully.

You know what? Is there a word for that? I don't have a word for it. Is it culture?

Would to God, for me in my house, I would rather blot out the church. I would rather remove services than we should perform something of this kind that reinforces us in our deceit and dulls us in our inability even to discern the truth of our own condition as sinners.

We've never burned like David.

And don't think that it demands capital sin in order to feel the blot of it.

Because sin is sin.

And in God's sight, there's not major or minor, greater or lesser transgressions. Because the nature of sin, as I've said, is presumption against God. Whether you're fornicating with someone or not, it's presumption against God. Whether you're fornicating with someone else's wife, singing to the man's murder, or sticking your hand in the collection box, or acting deceitfully at work, or complimenting people to smooth away for a transaction for a sale, it has the same nub, the same essence, the same essential ingredients that constitute sin as sin. And in fact, if you've not moved on to major sin, the progression will bring you there. If you're allowing, quote, minor transgressions, and you can dismiss them because you have a relative scale by which you evaluate it, who are you to evaluate it? Who are you to say it's minor? Who are you, God, that you can assess the moral consequence of an act? You're heaping presumption upon presumption. So, God's yet to hear our cry for mercy.

Maybe He'll hear it tonight.

Maybe this is the beginning of breaking in, where we acknowledge, my God, I need mercy because I cannot bear this acknowledgment that against you and you alone have I sinned, and I've done this evil thing in your sight, as if you were not there to see, or if you did see, you didn't care because you don't have that kind of highfalutin moral sensibility of the kind that I have. I'm really more moral than you are, because I would probably have been offended, but you're not offended, so you're less a God than is ascribed to you.

Understand the implications. Understand the implications.

As if our moral sensitivity is greater than his, because if he was there, he didn't take note of it, so evidently it didn't offend him.

Maybe he's just saving it up for the day of judgment.

Won't you be surprised then that what you thought were trifles were dutifully recorded in his book, and you'll have to stand before him in that day and give answer of the things that you've done in your body, both good and bad? There's no sense of that in the Church.

No sense of impending judgment.

No sense that one day we shall be required of.

God's a sport.

He's a pretty, you know, easygoing kind of a deity, because that's the kind we like, and reinforces us in our way, and we are assured that he's one of the boys. Although the Scripture warns us that God's condemnation of Israel was, you thought I was such a one as yourself. You, dear young saps, need to know that God is other than what you think he is. That's what you need to know.

Profoundly other.

And for us to use phrases like holy, holy, holy, and to come out of our mouths like so much stew denigrates holiness itself. We can't use that word until we've seen him high and lifted up and cry out.

Holiness is... I don't have a word for what I'm about. Can you see that?

Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy, because if it's according to me, I'm finished.

There's no hope.

The only one upon whom I can cast myself in any chance of getting this vile thing expelled from my consciousness, my memory, my heart that is burning with shame is if you expunge it. I'm cast upon you with a desperation of a kind that I have never before known or needed to know so long as I thought that my life was relatively reasonable and pleasing in your sight. But now, when I see what in fact I am and am capable of, unless you forgive, unless you exercise mercy, unless you expunge and blot out my transgressions and wash me thorough from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, I'm a goner.

My nights are just filled with horrible images and restlessness and my peace has departed.

I can't praise, I can't sing, I can't have any kind of morning communion with you, coming to the Lord's table is drinking sickness and delphin to myself. So long as this condition remains unattended by you, I am for all effects and purposes out of commission and I'm Israel's king and supposed to be the model of what you are. I'm the earthly equivalent of what you are in heaven and if they see me in this condition, how will that reflect upon you and your majesty?

I'm desperate.

And God waits to hear that note of desperation. For I know my transgression. Tell you what, you dear saints, don't pray for anything else. Don't pray for ministry, don't pray for doors to open, don't pray for the success of your musical group or the increase of church, pray for this.

I want to know my transgression.

I want to know the truth of my condition, not as I see it, but as you see it.

Because if I'm my own judge, I will invariably let myself off the hook.

I will invariably find justification. It wasn't adultery, it was love and you know the way it is, Lord, and I've had a disappointing marital history and this lady came who's once won in a lifetime and true that she was also married, but unhappily, but when we came together, Lord, you know what it was, it was extravagant music, it was ethereal. Surely you had to be in it.

You know what man is?

In his deception, in his artifice, in his ability to gild and purvey things in such a way as he comes out smelling like a rose? We need to know the truth of our condition as God sees it. Ask God for the moral stamina to bear that revelation. Because when it came to a prophet by the name of Isaiah, whose heads and shoulders above you, in every way, the man came undone and cried out, what was me? I'm a man of unclean lips and I'm living in the midst of the people of unclean lips because I've seen the Lord not as I thought him to be in a acceptable format that reinforces my status quo. I saw him as he in fact is, high and lifted up, which means to say impaled on a cross. I saw the face of the Lord battered. I saw it blood spattered. I saw that he had no beauty that any should desire him. And seeing him in that condition, I have seen God as God. I have seen the majesty of God in the suffering of this one.

And seeing him like that, I see myself. In fact, until I see him like that, there's no seeing of myself.

To see yourself independent of God is a formula for deception. Or to see yourself relative to other believers, you'll always come out heads and shoulders above the rest. But to see yourself in the light of God as he in fact is, is to cry out I'm undone. When I preached this recently, I said, you don't have to wait to say I'm a man of unclean lips.

The problem is, I'm a man.

I've seen the Lord high and lifted up and I'm a man. And being a man, my lips unnecessarily defiled.

Being a man, I speak facetiously. Being a man, I'm seductive and corrupt.

Being a minister, I'm a glad speaker and a and a toothsome, sweet, able manipulator using words and tones and attitudes that serve my purposes.

Being a man means necessarily your mouth is corrupt.

Until you've cried out about being a man, you've not cried out. Something intrinsic in man for which present day Christendom is little embarrassed to acknowledge there's such a thing as the doctrine of depravity.

What's the whole word, Reg?

Ultimate depravity or total depravity? Total depravity.

There's no space. It's total.

Total depravity.

We're rotten through and through.

Where's there a man, a righteous man upon the Earth who doeth good and sinneth not? Where is one who seeks my face? The Old Testament is full of illusions that there's not one. That the religious are the worst malefactors. And in fact was proven by the fact that they themselves took the life of their own Messiah. That the most religious and the most pious and the prized student of Rabbi Gamaliel was the chief persecutor. That in the self-righteousness of a religious man is the evil that eventuates in persecution and murder.

Hey, what more testimony do you need? You think you're better than Saul? Better than David?

Have you surrendered to the truth that God says is the foundation of the humanity we all inhabit?

That there's no man good?

Oh, I know you've had seductive thoughts that something special about you and the way you twangle guitar or I don't know what that the Lord needs and wants and you're pathetic. We're dust, you dear saints, helpless, pathetic, deadly, sinners, capable of no good and no righteousness. We don't even know what righteousness is. We don't even seek it.

We don't salivate at the mention of the word.

We rarely ever invoke it. We don't love righteousness and hate iniquity. We refer to Jesus doing that, but it's not incumbent upon us. We have little or no moral sense at all.

Do you know that?

When I say we, you're just the victims who are sitting in front of me. I mean the church at large of which you're not exempt. You're part. And it's a rare soul who sees like this and cries out like this.

And one of them is A.W.

Tozer who writes, there's a grief in my spirit when I go into the average church, for we have become a generation rapidly losing all sense of divine sacredness in our worship. Many whom we have raised in our churches no longer think in terms of reverence, which seems to indicate they doubt that God's presence is there. Churches become humdrum, predictable, bland choruses, sung without appropriate conviction, although we can get ourselves into a bit of an emotional state. But it's a grief to Tozer and I think it's a grief to God because the sense of what is divine and sacred is out. We've never had it and our condition is so lamentable we're not even aware that we lack it and we think that we can complement and supplement its absence by something that we can perform or we can create. Again, the sin of presumption against God. The sense of the sacred is only something that God Himself can give. We can never fabricate it. We would be better off to shut our mouths and pull the plug out of our equipment and wait on God in holy silence if He will have mercy upon us and give us a sense of Himself as He in fact is, that we might begin to understand what reverence and fear is. We become a bunch of practitioners and whole churches are built on the quality of their so-called worship. He writes in the majority of our meetings there's scarcely a trace of reverent thought, no recognition of the unity of the body, little sense of the divine presence, no moment of stillness, no solemnity, no wonder, no holy fear. We just got a question at IHOP because I had made reference to the fear of God.

What is it art?

And how do you recognize it when it comes and how is it to be obtained?

I love the question because it acknowledges it's so totally absent from our consideration.

And I can just say whatever my little testimony is worth, in 41 years in the faith and traveling the world over in churches of every description and in the best of churches, the fear of God is absent.

If it were present, we would be biting our tongues. We would be speaking less. We would be chorusing less. We would be on our faces more.

There's not the reverent sense of God as God. And I don't know what to say about it or cry about it or how to obtain it, except that we acknowledge our pitiful condition and ask His mercy. Lest we go on playing church and affecting little or nothing.

That was Tozer's cry in the 1960s.

There's no solemnity, no wonder, no holy fear. And so often there's a dull or a breezy song lead full of awkward jokes as well as a chairman announcing each quote number unquote with the old radio continuity pattern in an effort to make everything hang together.

We've all seen this. Maybe we've all practiced it.

A succession of choruses most times without even a comment from one chorus to the other.

Why? Because we really haven't anything to say. That's in keeping with what we are ostensibly singing.

We don't have someone who comes to us out from the presence of God and has been on His face and knows the sense of the holiness of God and the fear of God and can interject a word here and there in that song service that saves us from just being a patter of repetitious choruses. The most pressing need just now is that we who call ourselves Christians should frankly acknowledge to each other and to God that we are a stray. That we should confess that we are worldly, that our moral standards are low, and that we are spiritually cold. We need to cease our multitude of unscriptural activities, stop running when and where we have not been sent, cease trying to sanctify carnal projects by professing that we are promoting them in the name of the Lord and for the glory of God. How dare you sanctify your carnal ambition by invoking God's name? Doesn't your shame ever catch up with you? How dare you use the word prophet and apostle when you have the faintest notion of what it in fact means and bandy it about as if it's the latest vogue that we could articulate and mouth at will. That's taking the Lord's name in vain. This is presumption that becomes blasphemy and we're so accustomed to it that we don't even blush.

In fact, blushing itself is a lost art.

So when I spoke in, what's that country, I always forget the name, 70 years under communist rule at the very southern end of Europe.

It begins with an A. Armenia.

A German mission, they had me to speak to the high school teachers who were secular. They were sponsoring the high school and paying the bill.

I'm a former high school teacher myself.

What was the subject the Lord gave?

The word moral.

I said to those teachers, and the whole church needs to hear this, do you realize that teaching is a moral vocation? I'm saying to secular teachers that to teach is not to disseminate mere information. To teach is to raise questions of an ultimate and a moral kind that have to do with the issues of what is good, what is true, what is righteous, what is to be desired, what is reality, and that if you remove from men the moral quotient, you not only degrade men, you remove their humanity altogether. To be moral is to be a man. And the more moral you are in the disposition of your soul, and view every act and conduct from the moral perspective, how is this pleasing in God's sight, forwarding his purposes, not does it work?

Does it succeed? Will I enjoy the benefit?

What is the moral issue at stake in buying something that you're well able to afford?

But morally speaking, what's your habit? Who thinks like that?

And the avoidance of that thinking is reflected in the debased condition of the Church that lacks a sense of righteousness. How can it talk about a God that's holy and revere him and fear him when in its own life and conduct it does not even take into consideration the most elementary things pertaining to what is moral? That needs to be revived, saints.

And you know what?

If you go to the dictionary tonight, you'll not find an adequate answer. Either for the word moral, or for the word righteous, or for the word holy. These are the great words that you don't obtain through dictionaries in definition. These are the words that you apprehend, and that apprehend you.

Got that?

That you intuit.

That's in keeping with the growth of your moral character and your sensitivity toward God.

And the integrity of your life and the carefulness with which you're walking and speaking, and the acknowledgement that you're a sinner being saved by grace.

That you're a man of unclean lips.

How great is God's love to take Israel's choicest king, who is the sweet singer of Israel, God's greatest psalmist, and who reveals in these songs such an extraordinary intimacy in the knowledge of God, and allow him to fall into this most heinous sin, and to allow him to go unperturbed for a season until the prophet himself pegs him, and then to evoke this cry. That he's willing to humiliate his choicest servant, and allow him to go through sin and transgression in order to bring him to a place of contrition and repentance that would be a model for every subsequent generation, except ours.

That's how important God thought the question. He gave us two Davids.

The David who exposed sin in his own failure and acknowledges it, against the in the alone have I sinned, and the David who came to requite that sin by being high and lifted up in unbelievable anguish of body and soul. Because Karl Barth says, no man can begin to estimate what sin is until he sees what has been required to expiate it.

Got the picture?

Until you see how far the father had to go to expiate sin, you don't know nothing yet. You have just subscribed to conventional wisdom and to a body of nomenclature and correct doctrine, but it has not pierced you. It's not become through reality. It has not evoked from you a cry for the mercy of God. And therefore, if you've missed the reality of sin, where have you found reality at all? If you've not found reality at the point of sin, where have you found it? Well, little wonder you have gone on from unreality to unreality in your choruses, in your so-called worship, and the whole decorum of the Church. It's unreal until we get back to the foundation of the truth of our condition as God sees it and desires that it be known based on the revelation of himself as he has paid what is required to expiate it. Sin is more evil than you know. Of course, you don't even know evil. You're suckers and easily influenced and you're quite comfortable in the world. Only a few characters like me are chafed and can't bear it, not only for its flagrant evil, but for its mentality and its culture and its advertisements and the kind of soothing things that go along from the classroom to the TV channel to the newspapers and magazines that there's a conspiracy.

Can you cover your mouth, sis, at least when you're young? Try covering your mouth.

Because the speaker always interprets that as boredom. And you can't afford to be bored over this subject.

Where was I?

There's a conspiracy against truth, against reality. And that which is evil purports to be good and is depicted as good and is accepted as good, not just by the numb world, but even by Christians more than we are aware. You don't know evil until you can see it in the face of apparent good. I yanked out the TV set years ago from my house when I saw all of the kids of the community clustered around in the dark room, glued to that screen, and they weren't watching porno.

We only have one channel up in Minnesota.

They were watching a drama about the Olympics of a romance between an American male athlete and a Russian woman. But the concept of romance that was being set forth was so of the world, was so vile, was so soulish, was so untrue and unreal, and these kids were sucking it up as if this were coming right from the throne of heaven itself as uttermost reality. Well, my son, who was one of those who sucked it up, has now divorced his wife and will not be reprimanded and thinks that he's doing God's service, not Jesus, but God, because he's emancipated from an unhappy marital situation to which he need not submit, forgetting that there's such a thing as covenant and that God hates divorce and covenant breakers, he has fashioned for himself a rationale of self-justification by which he has severed a relationship that leave his three children dangling between one parent and the other, because his lust for another woman who has come up off the sidelines is presently so attractive. I wonder how far back that goes to what they were sucking out of the TV tube in those early years that either we didn't correct or we didn't recognize what was, what pervasive thing was going into their systems and would one day eventuate itself in such tragedy as we're now unhappy to relate. Divorce is as common in the church as it is in the world.

No fear.

No fear that God hates something and if he hates it, isn't that enough reason to put aside every thought of your unhappiness and if he's a covenant-keeping God, however unpropitious the present marriage seems, isn't he able to take the worst elements of it and turn it to the good if you remain bonded in covenant agreement with him? Well, I'm believing for that 42 years later and we've not yet seen daylight out of the tunnel but I believe not only will we see it, that when it comes in God's honoring of covenantal faith that the issue will be more than just domestic harmony that is finally obtained but the glorification of God because the reason your marriage has gone asunder is that your prime criteria for its evaluation was your happiness and not his glory. Your happiness, your satisfaction, your gratification while you still have your looks. Where's God who is Lord, who has saved us out of death and that our life is not our own? How all of a sudden has it become our own if we're being frustrated sexually and the wife is no longer, what's the word, cooperative and she has moods and that we don't even realize we ourselves are the ones who have perverted the whole atmosphere that make her to be intimate with us and agony against her own integrity and if we compel, we're brutes because how shall we be sensitive to what God has made in his image where we're not sensitive to the God who has made them in his image and don't see that there's a life fluttering there that we ourselves are despoiling and brutalizing and running over because we're so taken up with ourselves and our own satisfaction and not held accountable. You don't have to make explanation if the church itself will not continue to receive you, others will. Divorce is not so great a scandal, it's a commonplace. So he cries out in verse 5, indeed I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.

Oh so that's it, now we know your problem David.

Your mother probably was in a compromised moral condition in that night when she cohabited with your dad and therefore you were conceived in iniquity.

Well that's the way you Americans would think. But it's not so.

He was conceived in iniquity because we are all in iniquity and that he was born guilty he says. There's something intrinsic in man himself that's Adamic, that's vile, that is utterly opposed to God but can be trained to be domesticized and learn to say the right things and be polite about God but be effectively its own lord even while it calls him lord.

He's recognizing that his problem goes much deeper than Bathsheba. His problem goes back to his birth.

Bathsheba only revealed what was always the truth of his life, that he's a man and capable of iniquity, given the right circumstance and occasion.

He proved it.

And God will prove it with you unless you vicariously identify with David and say if he was capable what shall I say?

Am I made of better stuff?

We need a new birth, a clean heart and a new spirit when God will have blotted out our transgression and washed us and created in us something altogether other than what we were from our inception.

That atom has got to bite the dust.

And it's amazing how few have seen to it in their own baptism in water if in fact they were really baptized rather than sprinkled. But how many that were immersed really had such a consciousness of the depth of their Adamic taint, the innate corruption in their humanity not just in their boo-boos and in their worst devices but in their virtue. It's your virtue that finds you out. It's the things that you celebrate and want to retain that show the essence of that which is of man and contrary to God. And unless you're willing to bring that to death, you can forget about being raised unto a newness of life. How many believers are there who are so aware of the truth of their condition and so despise it and know that no correction, no discipline, no lying on a bed of nails, no amount of discipleship is ever going to alter this.

This is stubborn. This is pervasive. This is intrinsic. This is me as man.

This is from Adam and there's no freedom from it except by death at the cross and the provision God has made for it that only death itself could meet.

Follow me?

We have made a sham of baptism. We've made a sham of the Lord's table. The sacraments have become trivialized.

Why?

Because God himself is trivialized. His worship is trivialized. Our sermonizing is trivializing. The way we conduct ourselves without the fear and reverence and awe of God, of necessity, trivializes God.

How then shall the sacraments be made exempt?

If you've not met death in the crucifixion and burial with Christ, your Adam is very much alive. He's just only learned how to be cover up and be made polite and religious and inoffensive until the Lord will reveal something again to your shame. He did it for a whole nation, Germany, and made Israel the revelation of its depravity. Lutheran though it was, Reformation nation though it was, it was capable of the systematic annihilation of God's ancient people and that without a twinge of conscience. Their nominal Lutheranism did not save them from bestiality and it will not save you either. What happened with Katrina and the bursting of the dams in New Orleans and people being crunched into the, what do you call it, the arena there? Rape, murder, what do you call it, mass rape, children going into the john are victimized. Only one black pastor whose statement I carry cries out that the black community of New Orleans failed in its moral responsibility when the crisis came and all semblance of order was removed and even the police forsook their positions.

Men acted like animals.

Don't be shocked if conditions should come in the world that is in process of collapse and restraints are removed to see how men will conduct themselves and how you yourself might be tempted. Unless you love righteousness. Unless there's something more important to you than your own self survival you'll be victim. But that righteousness is not something you learn by discipline.

That righteousness is very God. Righteousness is God.

And we have him in as proportion as we have repented of unrighteousness, of the Adamic life of its thought and particularly its religiously amenable forms to which we have given ourselves much too mindlessly. Keep your heart with all diligence. The book of Proverbs says for out of it issue all, spring all the issues of life. You can't believe what I've paid to keep my heart with all diligence.

I've lost the publisher. I've lost the affiliations.

You stand out like a soft thumb when you can't go along. When your integrity will not permit. When you're able to discern that which is of the spirit and that which is a soulish counterfeit. And you cannot wear a smile with the counterfeit and nod your head in agreement as if what is going forth is valid and of God. When it is soulish, when it is manipulative, when the effect of it is to reinforce the immaturity of saints and not bring them indeed to sonship. And if you don't go along, you will be visibly in the place of objection.

You'll be the square peg in the round hole. Integrity costs something. Righteousness costs something.

To be morally minded costs something and it costs it continually. And right now constitutes very little of our present consideration.

Got the picture? So just like Isaiah who shall go for us?

He answers, send me and the Lord says go.

Because his lips have been purged.

He's received the treatment from off the altar of God. God agreed with Isaiah's cry that he's a man of unclean lips.

He did not say, hey, don't get carried away now.

You're my number one prophet. You're the prince of the prophets. You've been prophesying for five chapters grandly. Don't, just because you caught a little glimpse a little vision, get all overworked and where you think yourself undone and that you're like Paul the less than the least of all saints?

God agreed with him.

Or else why was the call taken from the altar by the seraphim and put to his lips unless there was that agreement? So let me ask you, discerning saints, if Isaiah required a purging and God acknowledged that his cry was valid, that he was a man and therefore his mouth was unclean by virtue of being a man and that this man also needs to have his sins blotted out before he can say, I will teach transgressors your ways, if these great men and the Job that I've been reading today, I abhor myself, I repent in dust and ashes. I heard by the ear and now my eyes see if I abhor myself.

God says, good.

Now you've spoken rightly, but my anger is kindled against your so-called spiritual comforters who are giving you a lot of blab who don't even really know me and I've yet to hear from them what I've heard from you, that you abhor yourself. Because in the light of my holiness, my righteousness and what I am as God, every man ought to abhor himself.

When I hear that, I'm requited.

Now you go pray for your comforters, lest my wrath come upon them. If Job required that acknowledgement and David requires the blotting out of his transgression and Isaiah the blotting out of his unclean mouth with a cold, what do we require? Who have sung about the blood. Without any real deep apprehension of the need to be purged, that there are stains so indelible, transgressions so vile, if not in act, at least in word and thought and ambition or rivalry or jealousy or whatever, that we need to be purged by the power of the blood, which is just a wishy-washy little noxious nothing unless there's a real cry that quests that purging, that cries out, purge me.

Blot out my transgressions.

When has the Lord heard that from us? Because what transgressions have you had to blot out, you nice Kansas City kids?

What transgression? Who have you raped last?

Are you going to wait for a rape before you cry out? Or will you say, Lord, presently, if I've not raped, it's only the grace of God and the mercy of God.

But I know that if David was capable, what shall I say?

And I recognize the truth of that condition in which I was born. I was born guilty. I was conceived in iniquity.

I'm still in that iniquity.

And unless you blotted out a clean heart, I will soon enough give evidence of this truth to my own eternal regret and shame. Save me from it now by the power of what you have shed.

And save me from just what's the word?

Making of it a shallow sham confession and a little proper reference to the doctrines of the faith that are not deeply felt or sought. Because we do not see ourselves as sinners needing to be saved by the grace of God. If we miss the issue of sin, saints, we have missed the issue. There's no hope for reality if we have not found it there.

So, enough ranting and raving. Shall we pray? Precious God on high.

Your mercy, Lord, is sending this aging man into the midst of this youthful congregation with thoughts and reflections that seem to come from the remotest place. But we thank you for our love, Lord, that will not let us go. You know our condition, my God. Let us follow as all get out. We don't have a message that's vibrant. We can't address sinners unless we ourselves have been sinners and have been saved out of the depth of transgression and evil and have come to love righteousness and hate iniquity in any form. We avoid the world and don't want to in any way reflect it consciously or unconsciously as if it's something we can toy with because it does not really reflect the truth of our condition. It reflects it more than you know. You spend more time in your mirror and evaluating what color dye that you're going to use for your hair and your eyelashes than you've ever spent in devotion. We're worldlings and shallow and we're even in the chorus.

We're invited to participate.

My God, have mercy on us. Hear a cry for mercy not only for ourselves but for the Church at large. Come, my God, in reality here at this level in this place over this issue. Even tonight if there's anyone who bears the faintest conviction for transgression and iniquity that has not really been deeply acknowledged nor mercy therefore received for it and that the evil nub yet remains and makes one a potential prospect for a future transgression then meet that one, my God in the place of truth and integrity. You're generous in your mercy to those who call out to you in sincerity and in truth. Come, my God and hear as many cries and petitions as saints are willing to make to you even this night in Jesus' name we pray.
