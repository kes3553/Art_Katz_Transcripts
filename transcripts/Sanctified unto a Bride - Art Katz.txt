Sanctified unto a Bride - Art Katz

Well, I have to apologize for anyone here who has heard me speak on Psalm 102 before, but that's the text.

I don't argue with the Lord. That's what he wants.

The text is inexhaustible. It will never ever be expressed in the same way that's true of any text. This is a remarkable, apocalyptic and eschatological Psalm.

How do you like that language?

You better like it because you have to learn to understand that something could be written seven centuries before the advent of Christ, so inspired by the Holy Spirit, to describe a future that is not yet, and that concludes the age, concludes the whole drama of redemption, brings about Israel's restoration, affects a bride for the bridegroom, and wins rebellious nations unto the Lord all in one fell swoop. All that could be contained in one Psalm?

Yes.

If you read it rightly, interpret it, draw it out, because the Psalms are so special. They are a particular literature, and they're not to be read like anything else. It's more that you have to swim in it, immerse yourself, and just continue to ponder and reflect. Let the meaning seep into your being. Well, we don't have all kinds of time, so I'm almost dismissing the first half of the Psalm, though it deserves very serious consideration.

When you'll read it, you'll say, this was written by a man in a concentration camp.

This sounds like somebody writing out of one of the Nazi death camps, because it describes a man whose skin is blackened, sticking to his bones, he can't eat, he's solitary, and confined. My days are like a shadow, in verse 11 that declines, I am withered like grass.

Verse 9, I've eaten ashes like bread. Verse 8, my enemies reproach me all the day.

They that are mad or angry, incensed against me, are sworn against me. This thing takes it out of the context of Nazi brutality, and brings it into the context of future Islamic fury and vengeance against the Jew. Evidently, if this psalmist is not just speaking for himself, but for an entire people, which is how we ought to understand this, Israel has suffered devastating defeat. It is now confined by its enemy, who is reducing it daily unto death under the most wretched of conditions, and taking a delight in seeing the progressive deterioration of this Jewish people, and mocking and taunting and reproaching all the day. That means that the psalmist is in a place of captivity, he can't escape from the torment of this harassment, it's part of what he has to eat with his bread as ashes. Dear Saints, will you take my word for it? This is a graphic description of exactly the conditions that many of my kinsmen will face in the last days. That's what makes this an eschatological psalm, meaning it refers to the end, though it's written centuries before even the advent of Christ.

Isn't that a stunning thing in itself? Why so?

So that we will be equipped to anticipate what those days will mean, and if Jews are going to be so brutalized, where do we stand at that same time? If indeed we have not escaped, and we're yet in the earth as I believe the church must be, for it is its golden hour, how will we stand when they are being so abused? It will be one of the great questions that will determine who in fact the church is. The German church collapsed under questions much like this, and could not bring itself to identify with the Jewish people, knowing that if they did, they would end themselves in the same concentration camps.

We are going to face questions like that.

Wouldn't it be a wonderful grace of God to alert us to what the end will be, so that we will not be taken by surprise and suddenness in its coming, but have had a chance to prepare ourselves in our hearts, in our thoughts, in our understanding, in our spirit, and in the growth of the church to corporately bear such an hour as this? And I'm going to come to the church in just a moment, but I want you to get the sense, the context of this entire Psalm. There are some encouraging notes in it, because in verse 15, this Jewish spokesman for the entire nation in captivity speaks a new kind of note, so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. I so covet my kinsmen to come to such a place of an expression like this, that I would say it's worth whatever it takes to attain it. To bring them from their present secular, anti-Christ, Godless, humanistic, self-exalting mentality, to a place where they begin to consider the glory of God and His name, is already an indication of a people at the very threshold of eternal salvation, and it is suffering that will bring them there. So the multiple purposes of judgment, not only the righteous requirement of God, especially for a people who have had such a call, but in the judgment and in the suffering, the deep things are touched. The things that are, that the Jews thought to be the verities of life, and the things of real consideration, fall away like a dead skin. That's phantom, that's shadow, that's insubstantial. Now the issues that are real, eternity, God, righteousness, glory, this should have characterized our vocabulary and our mentality through all the ages. The world would be in a much better shape. But praise God that at the end, and it's the indication of the end, that duress itself, hostility against us, captivity, insult, reproach, have an effect of a kind where a Jew begins to consider and think in terms of the name of the Lord. It's a moot question to ask to what degree have we come to that consideration.

I'm not talking about a little catchphrase.

The name of the Lord is the Lord, his honor, what he is in himself, what he deserves as acknowledgement, that a Jew should think in those terms.

My cup runs over.

That is so precious, so blessed, that as again I say, whatever it takes to attain that, yes. And evidently our condition is so lamentable it's going to take a remarkable last day's suffering that is graphically described in this psalm without exaggeration. And you can read it at your leisure. He talks about, my heart is spitting, my days are consumed like smoke, my bones are burned as in a hearth, as in a furnace. If that's not a description of a death camp, of annihilation, I don't know what is, and if Jesus is right in his prophetic suggestion in Matthew 24 and Luke 21 when he was asked, what are the signs of the end and of your coming? And he speaks about a time of trouble coming to Israel, such as the nation has not ever before known, nor will again know, and that the magnitude of that suffering, trouble is so great that unless the days were cut short, no flesh would survive.

Can this be that description? I believe that it is.

And so if it exceeds the horror of the Nazi time where six million Jews were systematically annihilated, what will this time of Jacob's trouble be if according to Jesus, that future time will exceed the Nazi time, both in its casualties, fatalities, brutality, and extent.

This will not be confined to Poland, Germany, Europe. This will be global. It's the time of Jacob's trouble wherever Jacob is.

And so when I went to Birkenau, to Auschwitz, I visit all the concentration camps.

I visit Jewish cemeteries. I don't know what it is.

There's something about the death of my people and their history, their longevity, their presence, especially in Germany, that haunts me. But when you go to Auschwitz and three kilometers away is the Neue Camp. Auschwitz was originally a Polish army camp which the Germans adopted and began to practice the process of annihilation, but it was too slow. And so they had to devise a full and new total factory of death called Birkenau and the railroad tracks go right up to the gas chambers and the crematoria and barracks one after another, the foundations of which still remain. It took German ingenuity to devise a process by which that kind of annihilation can take place.

It's a problem of logistics.

I mean, how do you dispose of six million Jews in the space of less than a decade? The greater question is how do you dispose of 10 million Jews, two-thirds of present world Jewry, the same ratio that Jesus will find when his feet set on the Mount of Olives. Two-thirds of Jerusalem or Israel have already perished and one-third passes through the fire.

The women are ravaged.

If that ratio is any indication everywhere in the world, we're talking about two-thirds of world Jewry, roughly 15 million, 10 million will perish. Five million will be a remnant circulated through the nations, the surviving members of which will constitute the restored nation. Well, so when I was there at Birkenau with a brother from our community, he said, Art, if you believe that there's going to be a yet more extensive annihilation in a shorter period of time, three and a half years, would it not require camps of exactly this kind, death camps, places of annihilation, systematic annihilation?

I had never thought of that. I thought of a Jew here dying and there dying, but that won't do it.

There may well be camps of this kind in all of the great population centers in the world where Jews can be massed and fed into a process of annihilation, and what this man is describing is such a place.

I guess you know that I'm not a sensationalist. Do you know that? I abhor sensationalism.

I run the other way, but I'm forced to consider the grit and truth of what God is letting us know in advance and not to speak it and communicate it would be to do disservice to God who has given me this privilege.

So you must know I'm not exaggerating. I'm not speaking for effect. I'm not being a tearjerker. I'm not wanting to stir any sensationalism.

I want a sober recognition of what the last days will mean for the Jew for the issue of their survival is us. That we might extend mercy that they might obtain it.

Listen to this Jewish man.

Praise God for that in his extremity, though his days are like a shadow that declines in verse 11, I'm withered like grass, but thou, oh Lord.

Is that precious?

But thou, oh Lord. Oh, if only you dear man was able to say that a decade earlier, you would not be in that camp. But praise God that through the that camp and through its privation and the extremity of it, you're for the first time acknowledging the Lord as thou. But thou, oh Lord.

I'm like grass. I'm withered. I'm ready to go. And I'm nothing. I'm just a vapor.

But thou, oh Lord, you shall endure forever.

Yes, that's true. My God. This is foundational truth. I'm a vapor. I'm withering away.

But thou, oh Lord, shall endure forever. To say that, to know that, to believe that and and to express that is already salvation. And thy remembrance unto all generations. And here's the key verse for us tonight. Thou shalt arise, which is very suggestive of resurrection. Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion. The distinctive character of God in its quintessence is mercy. You will arise and you will be what you will be. You'll exhibit and express what you are in yourself.

Mercy.

Yes, we're suffering this as if you're absent. But there's going to come a time when the purpose of this suffering and this attrition will have been fulfilled. And you will arise and affect our release that no man can perform. You yourself will deliver us out of bondage and prisons and cells and dungeons in the most remote corners of the earth where we will have been driven and be in utter hopelessness of futility and darkness and chains.

And something will come.

A light will flood our cell and the fetters will break from our wrists. The doors will burst open and an angel will be bidding us to leave. God will reveal himself to the saints.

I'm getting Holy Ghost chills.

In such utter supernaturalness as my secular-minded Jewish kinsmen must have opportunity to glimpse in their last chapter of their earthly tenure because they are deeply cynical and empirical. You know about the debate I had with an Orthodox Jewish teacher years ago when they sent for a Jew for Jesus to discuss these issues in an Orthodox school. And I shared and there was the teacher Van Dyke Beard, Jamelka, I mean right out of Central Casting of Hollywood. He was the epitome of Orthodoxy. And there I was the roused about Jewish believer and I shared what I could. We engaged, naturally we fell into a argument, a clash. The bell rang, the class emptied and we spilled out into the hall, still toughing it out. And at a certain moment I squinted my eyes and I looked at this man. I said, sir, I said, do you believe that God opened the Red Sea and potted it and allowed Israel to go out as upon dry ground? The guy, he choked and spluttered as if I had splashed cold water on him. Do you believe that Sarah gave birth to Isaac as a miracle beyond any age of childbearing?

You know what he said about the Red Sea?

He said it was a confluence of tides. That's the cerebral, humanistic, rationalistic, empirically minded Jew even when he is Orthodox in his practice. He cannot bring himself to be Orthodox in his belief. To believe that God raises the dead is total offense to the secular mind. And yet we Jews are called to be a nation of priests in the light of the world. We have got to meet God and see him in his supernatural power, not just as observers, but as the very issue of our deliverance. That's why he's bringing us to captivity in a hopeless way that cannot be altered or affected by man, because we are man centered, humanists. We need to see God as God in his power to deliver, and he will. So, thou shalt arise. Praise the Lord for faith being quickened and have mercy upon Zion, Israel. For the time to favor her, yea, the set time is come.

This guy has got his head screwed on right.

He knows something about God and his power, and that there's a set time. It's not Kronos, it's Kairos for you Greek speakers.

It's not a time, it's now 830.

It's a set time, something reserved in the wisdom of God for a certain point in history in which he will rise and act and deliver. And this Jew senses this reality about God. How many of us, Christians, spirit-filled, have not yet come to this kind of understanding, that there is a set time, that there are purposes of God that he need not identify. And though we're called to wait and trust, there will be a moment in his choosing when what seems to us a hopelessly impossible situation will be delivered. But now comes the question, what constitutes that set time?

And that's where we come in.

Yea, it's time to favor her. She's suffered plenty historically and right to this moment, but the set time is come to favor Zion and affect her deliverance.

And what constitutes the set time?

Verse 14, for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof.

Put that in your spiritual pipe and smoke it. Open that up, exegete that. This is terse, t-e-r-s-e. This is compact. This is prophetic. This is poetry.

This is language intensely condensed and full of image and suggestion that needs to be opened and that we might understand what constitutes the kairos, the set time for which God is waiting.

It has not to do with Israel. It has got to do with the people called his servants. That's us. And what about the servants?

What is he waiting for that releases his power to deliver Israel? We take pleasure in her stones and favor her dust? God is waiting for us to become archeologists?

You simpletons.

This is poetry, dear saints. The dust is not antiquity. The dust is the crumbling, decomposing cities of Israel that have suffered devastation. Today's Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Bathsheba and Tiberias, every present city of Israel, I'm predicting prophesying from what I understand of scripture, what God has put in my heart, is scheduled for devastation and ruin. That's why in Ezekiel 36 it talks about when they return, the first object is to rebuild the cities that have been left desolate and in ruins and without inhabitant.

There's going to be wholesale devastation.

You can see the scenario being prepared even now. Israel pulling out from the Gaza settlements, who's going to occupy that area? But those who hate their guts and will have greater proximity to fire their rockets and finally to invade and overwhelm a military that is trained for the battlefield but not for its own streets. That's why it says that your young men will be caught up like antelope in nets at the head of every street and your conquerors will say lie down.

I'm talking Isaiah chapter 51.

Lie down and we will walk over you and they lie down. Scriptures indicate not only wholesale destruction and loss of inhabitants where they go either death or expulsion or flight, but defeat and humiliation. Lie down and we will walk over you.

There's a word in Yiddish, siloches.

I learned from my mother, means spite. And isn't that so much at the heart of the Islamic personality?

They're not content merely to defeat. They've got to rub the captive enemy raw. They've got to taunt and mock. They've got to humiliate and spoil.

Lie down and we will walk over you. Dear saints, are you ready for this? You lovers of Israel, you're going to be so disappointed that you might be in threat of loss of faith. After all, where is that great falling away going to take place of which Paul speaks? Can it be of the shallow, sentimental, charismatic Christian Zionist who wants so much to see present Israel succeed? To find out not only will it not succeed, but it's going to be brought into utter devastation, ruin and expulsion. And you'll ask, where is God?

And we thought, yes you thought, but you didn't understand the scripture.

You just took out a few prophetic verses and made it to somehow fortify and support your view. Instead of coming to the scripture and letting the scripture determine your view, you came to the scripture with a view and found only those verses that would verify it.

Therefore, you're in for shock.

Will God go this far?

Jacob's trouble, will he be that devastating? I believe so. So what does this mean? What's the set time?

The set time is not something that God waits for from Israel, it's something he waits for from the church. An attitude toward Israel at that time of devastation, because the world, the whole world, will be rubbing their hands in glee and loving it. You know the world hates Jews, they don't need much reason, but they'll have enough to kindle their anti-Semitic hearts, and they'll love to see Israel despoiled. They love to see the mighty brought down, the favored and the comfortable and the successful. That resentment that is in the heart of the unrequited and unregenerate gentile world that loves to see the Jew reduced.

They'll be rubbing their hands in glee, and there might be a number of Christians among them of a kind, nominal.

In fact, the issue of what the attitude toward Israel will be in that day identifies who in fact is Christian. Really, the true Christian will not be rubbing his hands in glee. He will be compassionate and identified with Israel in her suffering, in her judgment, in her devastation. Not from a distance, but in it. Identifying, being joined with them in a judgment Israel deserves for her sin, but the church, free from sin through the blood of the Messiah, volunteers to come down and into Israel's situation as much as Jesus came into the Jordan to be baptized in order to be identified with his nation's sin.

Can you understand that?

Can you understand God is waiting for that? This remarkable thing that defies every human calculation to have to be so identified with Israel as to join them in it and to commiserate with them and to anguish in your soul and have pity for her dust and compassion for her stones puts you in jeopardy.

You'll be marked. You'll be a Jew lover.

I've already had a dream in Minnesota of someone pounding on the door like three o'clock in the morning and I come down with my bathrobe on and there's some men in uniform and they take us just like that. Another woman, not my wife in the house, I don't know who she is, and we're thrown into the back of their vehicle, bundled up tied and we're taken off into the middle of the night without explanation.

Terrifying. One guy turns and looks back at me and says, you are among those who love the Jews.

Can you believe that the world can be brought to a pitch where an affection and a love for the Jew could be your death warrant? It was in the Nazi time and it will be in the last days. So the Lord here is not talking about sentimentality or superficial affection of the kind that we now enjoy when Israel is cute and have romantic notions about Jews. We're talking about an identification when Israel is far from cute, when they will be devastated, brutalized, ugly, despoiled. To identify with the people then in this deep way is a statement of such change that it's not to be expected in Gentiles. This is something transcendent of the same kind that Jesus himself exhibited for us, that while we were yet enemies, he died for us.

He didn't wait for us to improve and then save us.

While we were yet enemies, he identified and bore our rebellion in his own crunch at the cross, died for us.

That's God's saints.

This is when he sees his nature replicated in the church, having an attitude toward Israel that he had for us as we were when we were enemies. We will have for them while they're yet in judgment and before they've come to a place of repentance and return.

Why?

Because the nature that is in him is the nature that is in us. When God sees that, what he has hoped for and waited for in the church has been obtained because he has not only a church that has come of age, he has a bride adorned for the bridegroom, having the glory of God.

There's a great mystery. Everything comes together at the end.

All of the great mysteries, the restoration of Israel, the winning of the rebellious nations, the establishment of the kingdom, and the obtainment of a bride. Because if the Lord doesn't have a bride, there's no ruling over creation.

There's no dominion. How come?

Because the pattern was given in Genesis to Adam and Eve. He gave dominion to them, not the solo Adam alone, but to them. If they are the precursor and the symbol of the greater Adam, who also needs his Eve, as it were, a co-regent, a wife, that then dominion can be given and his rule be established over all creation. The issue of a bride for the bridegroom is not a little marital necessity.

Can you understand?

Dear saints, have you a sense of mystery? These are the great mysteries of the faith.

How do you know this art?

I can't tell you how, but look in Revelation to the references to the bride in chapter 21. I John verse 2 saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, something corporate, coming down from God.

It's not an individual.

It's a composite corporate entity and yet prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband.

What does it mean? She's had her hair do?

No, it means she has a nature like unto and kin to that of the bridegroom himself.

What kind of a nature?

One that loves the people while they're yet enemies and will die for them.

Having compassion under stones is your death warrant. It's not something from the distance.

It's an involvement and an integration with Israel in her uttermost suffering.

Whatever the consequence, you cannot withhold yourself.

It's the love of God that is compelling.

You've come to that condition.

Your character has been formed over a process of time corporately that is revealed and expressed toward Israel in that extremity. And in verses 21 verse 9, come hither, the end of the verse, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife, carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.

This is poetry. This is imagery.

This is saying much through few words, transparent as crystal, through and through the cookie. No darkness, no shadow, no deviousness, no subterfuge. A church without guile, pure, like the Lord himself, having the glory of God, her light was like unto a stone most precious, even as a jasper stone, clear as crystal, a bride adorned for the bridegroom.

Everything comes together at the end of the age.

Israel's restoration waits on a deliverer to come out of Zion, not from Israel, but a people called my servants.

What a description that is. And what about her? What about the servant?

Not anything that it does that's heroic, but what it exhibits in its essential nature and character that is so akin to God. Compassion, love, identification, mercy on a people who are so degraded and broken and badgered that even their great cities are nothing but stone and dust. And the world is loving it, but the servants of God are commiserating. They're completely different and other than the mentality that's found in the world. So the question is, where does such a people come from?

How were they formed?

Will they attain to this in a sudden moment, some miraculous waving of a wand? Or is this the final result of a process of God by which the church is sanctified, its character shaped, formed in his image through dealings, through the various things that we have been speaking of in these days. And the final test that it has come of age is what is its attitude toward Israel at the height or the depth of Israel's extremity. When God sees that the church has come to this place, that it's come of age, that it's like him, he has a bride, he no longer has to deal with the church, he's released directly to be Israel's deliverer. The set time to favor Zion has come. This shall be written for the generations to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. This event is so monumental that it cannot be exhausted just by the generation who lives through that time. It will reverberate through history, through time, through the millennial and eternal future. It is the consummating end of the age where the mysteries of God are all brought to a pitch and come together in a moment that reveals his glory. But how do we come to this character? Right now we're selfish, right now we're vain, right now we're carnal, right now we're concerned about where we're going to eat after the meeting and things like that. How do we come to this transcendent place of identification with the despised people as Gentiles? What have they ever done for you that you should be so extended toward them in such mercy and compassion, except God has been formed in you and your distinctive nature is his?

Well by what?

Means a process over a course of time, through dealings, through trial, through the very obedience, through communion, through all of the things that God has been speaking to us of these days.

Get the tapes.

So if you know you have a destiny like this, ought you not to be preparing for it.

Don't expect some magic.

This is the end of a process of sanctification of God being wrought in a church in such a way that the test of it is Israel as Israel has ever and always been the test of the church, which has failed. Israel is the, what's the word, the litmus test, the attitude, well the greatest giants of the faith have missed Luther himself became an anti-Semite and spoke in such horrendous terms, wrote a book called The Lies of the Jews that fueled Hitler four centuries later, destroyed the synagogues, burned in Talmud, do this, do that.

Brutal.

I forgot the name of the golden orator of the post-apostolic time, Chrysostom was another anti-Semite. We have a history not just of the average saints failing with regard to the Jew, but the best of the church. So when I say this, someone will say, Art, are you trying to say that the church of the last days will have a greater stature in Christ than Luther?

Yes. Must. Because if it has not, this time has not come.

God is waiting for this one thing and he knows when it comes. It will be exhibited and it will be demonstrable.

You can't hide this.

You cannot see Israel pulverized and be indifferent and aloof. You'll be in and with this people, no matter what the jeopardy to yourself. And when God sees that, while they're yet enemies, before they're saved, before they're saved, it's his nature.

And that's what he has waited for. He has obtained the bride.

So he will regard in verse 17, the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer. That may not be so much the prayer of the incarcerated Jews as our prayer, destitute, because that's the way we are. I don't know, have you ever been in a situation where the requirement of God is so great, however much you are anointed and prepared, you feel destitute? It's the prayer of the destitute who know that without God they could do nothing.

We're barren. We're nothing. We're dust. We're wholly dependent upon God.

We're crying out when we see the wretched condition of our Jewish kinsmen, our brethren. They are the least of his brethren and our brethren also. And we cry out and he hears the prayer of the destitute who know that they're destitute and that without God and his impartation and his life and character formed in us, what can we be to them?

We'll be like everybody else, angry, separate.

When God looks down in verse 19, from the height of the sanctuary, from heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that were pointed to death.

Didn't I tell you that?

He's going to hear these men in the most remote cells and dungeons that they'll be scattered to the outermost corners of the earth of utter hopelessness and that's when God comes in.

He'll hear their groaning.

He'll loose them that are appointed to death that they might declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem. Boy, what a praise that will be.

That will exceed Charismatica.

It will reverberate through the millennial age and into eternity when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the Lord.

What's this? What's this little thing tacked on here?

When the kingdoms are gathered together to serve the Lord, the people, the nations that are hostile and enmity with God in rebellion since the building of the tower of Babel, something has happened to them.

They are turned. They are converted.

They've seen something of so extraordinary a kind that is so demonstrably God that the wind is out of their sails, their opposition. There's no question anymore of who in fact God is because something has happened in the earth of such a kind made so visible not hidden in the corner but before the face of all nations that they have to acknowledge that God is God.

He's redeeming the prisoners.

He's turning to Zion and delivering the captives because something has happened with the people called servants that is even visible to the unbelieving world. What a remarkable conclusion of the whole redemptive drama.

Israel is restored. Its remnant is saved. Its captives are delivered.

A bride is obtained for the bridegroom and the nations that have opposed God come to a place of faith and join in the chorus of praises from one end of the earth to the other and their kingdom serve God.

You get all that out of one verse, Art? Yes.

It only takes one verse if you but read it rightly and understand what is concentrated in this text that needs to be opened for our consideration that we might marvel and expect such a conclusion of the age of which we will be the key and will not come to this condition in a day or in a moment. When then shall we begin to experience the redemptive sanctifying work of God corporately that his servants will come to such a condition as this, no sooner than today, to invite the Lord.

Lord, look at me presently.

Yes, I'm interested in Jews if they're in their best condition when they're cute but, you know, I'm sentimental but things get tough and it costs something to be in any way related or identified.

I would shrink. I'm a coward really and I want to play it safe.

I'm even hoping that there's an escape from this whole situation even though to remain in the earth would have glorified you.

Look what I am, Lord, but don't leave me that way. I welcome your work. I welcome your sanctifying work.

I welcome the processes of God by which as base as we are presently we shall be so conformed to your image that it cannot be said where we end and you begin. You're going to have a bride, Lord, appropriate to you that will be like you in nature and character that you might have dominion over your own creation and this is what it's going to take to obtain it. It's the crisis of Israel that compels us to come to this ultimate place through sacrifice and suffering which is what sanctification is because the end is so great. We're willing for whatever it takes, my God, for you to invest yourself in us because this is a corporate phenomenon, not a little virtuoso art cats or a special saint here and there.

This is a body. This is a composite corporate thing.

It's called a city that has come down from heaven. The bride is a city. It's a composite statement, but they have all come to the nature and character of very God himself which is pure compassion and love which is not just to be held but to be expressed whatever the consequence.

That's God. That's what he did at the cross. Why were we yet enemies?

And when he has a people who will do it with them while they are yet enemies, he really has a people. And when he could do it through Australians, well, the end of the age has come. Oh, you dear saints, fight against unbelief.

I can just see it written all over you.

You think you're hearing a fanciful tale, some musical speaking that's entertaining, but you're not believing. You're not receiving a prophetic interpretation of a prophetic text which you need now, or you will not bear or welcome the sanctifying work of God which is invariably painful in proportion to your carnality.

You'll not welcome it. You'll shun. You'll be satisfied with your present condition.

Maybe a little improvement, but you don't want to come to a bridal state if this is what it's going to take where the Lord is really going to deal. If he's going to go that far with Jews as to incarcerate them where their skin sticks to their bones, how far will he go with us to be a servant people whose conduct and character is the set time for which he waits? Are we willing?

I don't think he'll do it against our will, as many as will his servants.

I mean, what is a servant anyway if not someone who voluntarily gives his life to the Lord as if he has no life of his own or for his own?

That's voluntary. God doesn't conscript. He doesn't compel.

It's not a slave that has come as captive in battle. These are those who have laid their lives down as he himself laid his. Can I pray for such a church? Can we invite the Lord for such a work?

I'll tell you what, if you say yes, you'll be rushing to the communion table. We had it this morning.

You'll want it again tonight and tomorrow the next day. You want every enablement and grace from God that is to be given in his body and blood.

Once a month will never be enough.

You want to be sustained and renewed and strengthened in the remarkable impartation of his essential nature in that wine.

It's the spirit of his life.

You can't drink it and just cough something down and have a hiccup. Something has come into you beside fluid. It's the genius and spirit of that God, his nature. Something is being formed by eating and drinking. Something is being formed by obedience. Something is being formed by communion in early morning times of seeking the Lord and waiting in his presence.

And it's by such a means that he's going to have a people.

It almost makes our secular occupations a secondary thing and that this is the first and primary purpose of our life and being, as indeed it is. How far are you willing to go? You want to just be observers, rather than participants in this glory? I'll tell you what, if I know anything about God, if you'll say yes to the Lord tonight, see that's what makes a message an event is your response to it. If you'll say yes Lord, I'm not understanding all that this crazed man is speaking, but I'm understanding enough to know that this is very real and you're out for something of an ultimate kind. A church that has come to the very stature and fullness of Jesus Christ, unto a perfect man, a bride adorned like him.

And I want to be part in that, whatever the cost.

Look at me now Lord, I'm not even a candidate, but I'm asking mercy, that I might extend mercy. I'm asking your compassion for me, in my present condition, that I can have compassion later for them, because you've had compassion for me. Look at my framework, I'm dust, but I want to be part, I want to see you glorified, I want to see the fulfillment of your mysteries, I want to see your people restored, I want to see you with a bride, I want to see you seated in Zion, I want to see you ruling and reigning, and I want to be part.

I don't want to be on the sideline, whatever it takes. Starting tonight, I'm inviting it. You want to deal with my body? Is it the issue of health? You want to trouble my marriage?

It up for now has been just a model of temperamental compatibility and all of a sudden we're going to find we're not all that compatible as we thought. New agitations, new perplexities, new distresses by which you work in our deeps and flush out and bring to light what was otherwise concealed, that's what it's going to take. Children going haywire, accident, loss of employment, I don't know what, I don't want to paint some kind of drab picture, but I know that this is not going to be polite and it'll be in proportion to the depth of our need. We've been indulgent, slovenly, carnal till now, all the more must the Lord's work be vigorous. We've been more diligent than disciplined than less than the demand, but whatever it is, none of us will be absolved.

And you know what we'll do? We'll need each other. We'll need each other's comfort. We need each other's prayer. We need each other's encouragement because we're in something together.

This is a corporate thing and unless we all come, we don't come at all and therefore we'll be concerned and to give encouragement and help and counsel and correction and exhortation and rebuke even so that we might come through the words of truth spoken in love. The church will become the church and Sunday will not be enough.

We'll need even more than midweek services. We'll need breaking bread, going from house to house daily. We'll need a frequency of relationship and intensity that's open and true because we're going to be transparent as crystal. When is that going to happen?

Through the process of fellowship, truth speaking, being real, coming to the light.

That's how the bride is made as clear as crystal. Got a stomach for that? That's why you were born.

That's why you were saved and you're being called and he waits to hear from you.

Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. I'm willing. Whatever it takes, I trust your grace. I trust your mercy.

You're not an arbitrary God to pull the wings off of a fly.

Whatever it takes, however painful that I've got to suck air, I know that it's not accident and happenstance. You're sovereign.

This is what you have required.

I'll bear it and let it perform its work. I'll be eternally grateful. Don't listen to my ouch. Don't hear my complaint.

Be deaf to it and perform your work for your work is perfect.

We've been singing that. Now we need to believe that. Amen. Amen.

Let's pray. Lord, oh my God, we're so removed from your ultimate intention for us as your church, your servant people. We're shallow, selfish, superficial, light, giddy, frivolous, but my God, you'll not complete the age without us. You must have a bride and if it would not be composed of ourselves and those like us, from whom will you obtain it? Where will you find it if it's not made of stuff of the kind that we are, whom you've taken off the dung heap and you'll sit with the princes of your people? So we love you for your grace, for your mercy, Lord, that we will eternally rejoice for the part that we have in the conclusion of this so great drama. Yes, it will take eternities to review and to rejoice and to sift and acknowledge the greatness of our God. It'll be spoken from generation to generation of what he has done so impressively in the last days that unbelieving and hostile nations are required to turn and serve the Lord with their kingdoms and join in the great universal choruses of praise from one portion of the earth to the other because they're going to see something so monumental, so clearly, supernaturally God that it will take the wind out of their sails. It's the end of all argumentation of who is God. This is God, the God out of Zion, the God of set times, the God of the Psalms, the God of Israel, and to him every knee will bow and every tongue confess. How shall they argue and dispute further when they see visibly before them this remarkable phenomenon of Gentiles loving the Jews not out of sentimental or romantic notions but the very love of God, which is sacrificial and loves them not at their best but at their worst.

That's love.

That's the love that you exhibited toward us when you went to the cross and it's the love that you want to exhibit again when we go to the cross for them in that ultimate identification for who set time you wait. My God, you're repeating and rehearsing the reiteration of yourself at the cross through the church toward Israel and it's going to take a preparation and so listen to as many as are in this room who are saying yes freely voluntarily lord whatever it takes come you're a great redeemer and a great sanctifier you know where we are where we live you know the truth and the untruths of our lives you know where we are not crystal clear where we're murky and like to have it so and you will have a people who are true through and through transparent light crystal clear thank you lord through the mechanism of the church itself when it is the church when it's more than sunday services when it's a community of believers who are in something together and are to each other what we must be or will never come through and never become clean lord it will be painful before it's glorious we're cowards we shrink from it the embarrassment the humiliation of being found out but what keeps us and sustains us is your glory you'll be glorified nations will come to you my God and bow at your feet at this demonstration so what is our little petty suffering what is our inconvenience what is our embarrassment and humiliation it's nothing next to what you have born in order to bring my God nations into the reality of yourself and your kingdom and not the least your rebellious nation Israel so my God hear the hearts of your people we give opportunity now pray saints say something to the lord even audibly if you can't stand the embarrassment of saying something audibly how will you stand the dealing if you can't stand it in the church with those of like mind and heart have heard the same word how will you how will you stand it in the world come i invite you to say yes to God and not forfeit the so great calling of God in christ Jesus transact with him welcome his dealings counted all privilege it's all together love and mercy you'll be eternally grateful that you don't have to carry into eternity the shabby things that now affect and characterize our lives welcome his dealing become the church open your doors go from house to house daily break bread be broken come transact let the lord know he waits he'll not force this he waits for your voluntary yes will you give it to him tonight as if this were once and for all and that it doesn't wait tomorrow will not suffice you'll harden when you hear his voice harden not your heart come saints be saints transact with God the angels in heaven are waiting to rejoice for Jesus sake
