Message for Africa

00:00 -  But my subject tonight is not Israel, it's Africa. And there are occasionally times when a word has to be spoken that is not addressed to the congregation.
00:21 -  It's hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken. Can you understand mystery like that? That there's a time that has come in the wisdom of God
00:43 -  in which something has to be spoken into the earth, into the air. It's not intended for men, not to say that there's no benefit for it, but it's a declaration, something that must come in point of time.
01:09 -  And I am called to deliver it. So be patient with what you hear, count yourself privileged
01:21 -  for an historic moment whose time has come and that you are there to hear it and to draw out God's heart
01:35 -  that it might receive a full expression. Can you understand that? Okay, let's pray for this.
01:48 -  We're privileged to be together for such a moment whose time has come in this Cameroon, in this city, in this Africa. Lord, we invite you to open your heart
02:08 -  and send a word into the earth from the throne of heaven that shall not return to you void,
02:20 -  but accomplish every purpose for which it has been sent. Bless your own soul.
02:32 -  Gratify your own heart. Fulfill your own purpose. And we thank you and give you praise
02:42 -  that you have a word for Africa, that this continent is upon your heart, that you have an intention for it,
02:53 -  which we invite you to perform by commencing with this word and by it setting in motion
03:03 -  those things that will bring it to pass, not for our convenience, but the everlasting praise of your glory.
03:14 -  In Jesus' name we pray. God's people said Amen. The Lord woke me up
03:23 -  a few days ago in the early morning hours and flooded me with some thoughts and I thought I had better write them down.
03:35 -  So this is that writing that I'll share just as it was given. It begins with a scripture that is familiar
03:46 -  out of the book of Proverbs Chapter 14, Verse 34 Righteousness exalts a nation.
04:04 -  How I wish you would take that into your deepest heart. The word exalt means also to prosper.
04:20 -  God will prosper a nation that seeks righteousness because it pleases him.
04:31 -  He's the God of righteousness. And what distinguished Jesus as a son is that he loved righteousness
04:41 -  and hated iniquity. The two things go together. You can't have the love for the one
04:50 -  unless you hate the other. This distinguished Jesus, it was the hallmark of his sonship
05:00 -  for which reason the Father gave him an anointing above his brethren of gladness for that distinction.
05:11 -  So let me ask you. You needn't answer. It's a rhetorical question.
05:20 -  Do you esteem righteousness? Love it. Enjoy the word.
05:29 -  When you speak it and the occasions have been much too rare, the juice begins to run in your mouth.
05:42 -  And because you're becoming a son and a daughter, you recognize that there are daily occasions for righteousness,
05:55 -  for the neglect of it, even in the small things and in the everyday things.
06:03 -  The issue of righteousness should ever be before us as the church
06:11 -  because the church is intended as already the leaven of a kingdom to come, a certain presence within society
06:27 -  of a moral kind. Do you like that word? Morally.
06:37 -  The two words, righteousness and moral, go together. These words need to become dear to us,
06:49 -  into our thought and into our consideration. Because if we will not be that presence, if we will not exert and express a moral influence
07:06 -  in our African society, from where shall it come? What is moral is to insist upon the dignity
07:18 -  of what is made in God's image. And not to go along with conditions that degrade men.
07:31 -  And not to go along to condescend to conditions that degrade men, brutalize men
07:47 -  and rob them of their essential humanity. This is the devil's business to deform and to assault
08:02 -  what is in the image of God. Look what they did to Jesus on the cross. He was so brutalized
08:16 -  that he had no beauty that any should desire him. He was marked more than any man. The devil hates God
08:28 -  and hates God's image in men. And we the Church have an obligation to stand for what God has created
08:41 -  in his image. So just in the trip coming here tonight, just the trip coming here tonight,
08:52 -  we had to pass through your typical traffic. Of course you have lived with it so long, it's for you normal.
09:05 -  I want to tell you, I'm not speaking from the perspective of a white man from America.
09:16 -  I'm speaking from the perspective of a prophetic man from heaven. Your traffic conditions
09:29 -  are immoral, they're degrading. To fight the position
09:41 -  one car etching the other they'll see smoke. That's what a bumper
09:53 -  takes so much time to pass through an intersection for the want of a simple traffic light and the respectful order
10:08 -  that the traffic light represents. So that men can move in order to waste their time
10:21 -  without competing and striving because that's contrary to God's image in men.
10:33 -  You may think I'm picking on some absurd issue and you can find examples much worse than what I'm describing.
10:49 -  But such conditions should not be tolerated. They need to be opposed by the church that stands for God,
11:03 -  stands for righteousness, stands for what is tomorrow and for men in God's image.
11:14 -  It's a remarkable grace to be able to preach having passed through that traffic congestion and just sitting in the back seat.
11:30 -  If I had been driving, I would have been immobilized. How does one become spiritual
11:42 -  with the word of the Lord after you have been fighting your way to conditions like that?
11:52 -  And those conditions can be remedied. Those conditions can be altered when the church makes it an issue
12:08 -  and expresses its concern as it ought to establish a traffic light that obliges men to observe the structures of law and order
12:25 -  for their benefit. Oh, you dear children, don't you understand
12:37 -  there's a struggle between darkness and light that's taking place in the earth. And the powers of darkness,
12:49 -  the principalities and powers of the air want to prevail in the world. And they are unchallenged.
12:59 -  And they run the show. And they stand for chaos and destruction.
13:12 -  God stands for light and righteousness. And says, His Kingdom come
13:24 -  and earth as it is in heaven. Order is intrinsic to the nature of God. And we need to respect it,
13:38 -  to desire it, to see that it functions and that men do not circumvent it
13:48 -  because they have money or because they can bribe their way. All men should stand equal before the law
13:59 -  and order. It is a fundamental, foundational necessity for the integrity
14:10 -  appropriate to human life. Somebody needs to go to the legislature who are indifferent to this condition
14:22 -  because they don't have to face it daily. They are living in very elect suburbs with beautiful palatial residences
14:37 -  and chauffeur driven cars. They don't have to fight these conditions. They are living in a place of unreality.
14:53 -  And they are not at all affected by what is degrading men in this city every day. So would it be improper for a committee from the church
15:08 -  or committee of concerned Christians representing a network of churches who have collected tens of thousands of signatures
15:26 -  and to go to the legislature and present it as a moral requirement to establish a traffic light
15:38 -  at critical intersections because it is righteous. Amen.
15:49 -  Well, I know that you are not accustomed to thinking like this or acting like this because it is not spiritual.
16:01 -  And we are not concerned with the world and only with spiritual things. You are doing God this service
16:15 -  not to recognize that this is a spiritual issue. Because there is a moral question here that affects the whole character of life in Africa
16:37 -  and degrades men rather than exalts men in God's image. If you are going to have moral concern
16:50 -  you are going to be required to have political expression. And what begins with a traffic light needs not end there.
17:05 -  This is more than just an improvement. Although it will be an improvement there will be
17:15 -  this is the issue of structure and of order that dignifies human life
17:27 -  and gives men a better sense of themselves and a respect and esteem for their own humanity
17:39 -  that pleases God. The powers of the air will be terrified
17:47 -  if the church begins to think like this and acts like this. Because when you begin to install order
17:58 -  the powers of darkness and chaos will be set aside. You are making a statement
18:08 -  of a kingdom kind of a Godly kind that breaks their influence.
18:14 -  And if you keep it up they will be required to release their captives. So they prefer that you remain passive
18:31 -  and live with these conditions after all they have gone on so long after all they have gone on so long
18:41 -  and we have gotten used to it and have learned to live with it is not a reason to continue it
18:51 -  because righteousness exalts a nation. God will be blessed by the traffic lights
19:03 -  by the sense of order something will come into the atmosphere of a city
19:12 -  that has taken the pains in the expense to establish these elementary considerations appropriate to human beings
19:27 -  in God's image. I was brooding over the issue of Africa coming here from Australia
19:44 -  this is my sixth country in six days and tomorrow we will be in Burkina Faso I said Lord what is the word for Africa?
19:58 -  I have been in it many times the poverty the disease
20:05 -  the lack of employment low level of education what was the answer for Africa Lord?
20:16 -  And I believe he is saying in my heart the gospel is the answer the gospel will save Africa
20:26 -  not just in terms of salvation from sin but in the elevation of the life of the people because God has been brought into their consideration
20:42 -  and he is the God of order and they reflect that God the church has got to live by its faith
20:55 -  that's not the requirement for the church elsewhere in the world we Americans can say the just shall live by their faith but we have other sources and other securities
21:17 -  but in Africa the issue is faith if God says seek first the kingdom of God
21:29 -  and his righteousness and all things else will be added up to you can you believe that?
21:39 -  not just for yourself but for the continent God has established Africa
21:47 -  to demonstrate God and his reality and the truth of his word
21:54 -  the faithfulness of his promises because if your prosperity is not going to come from overseas gifts of charity
22:07 -  or technology as other nations your living conditions should improve
22:18 -  the world would look on the world would observe what's happened here?
22:27 -  the quality of life in Africa is rising the standard of living people don't have to carry merchandise all day on their heads
22:40 -  there's improvements and benefits that has not come from natural means but from God
22:52 -  who exalts righteousness he will improve the economy and the increase of harvest
23:01 -  because that's what his word says righteousness exalts a nation it will prosper it
23:12 -  where did the Lord give you this message brother? in Africa Tanzania
23:21 -  when I spoke out in an open field of the first African convert, the Ethiopian eunuch and so many came up to me when it was over
23:38 -  he said I would love for you to speak to my employer gladly I said who is she?
23:48 -  she's the head of the supreme court and the department of justice in Tanzania
23:57 -  the next morning I was there and as I came to her door
24:07 -  and under her portal the Lord said righteousness exalts a nation
24:15 -  and sin is a shame for any people and I came into her house a white man, stranger, a Jew
24:27 -  and I said your country is suffering from drought and corruption
24:36 -  and violence because you have not been righteous you have become an independent nation
24:45 -  you're no longer colonial and you began to usurp and to possess properties owned by white people
24:57 -  without fair compensation that is not righteous and therefore you're suffering God's judgment
25:08 -  he's kept back the rain he's allowed bribery and corruption to increase violence
25:17 -  all of the kinds of things that he would control or eliminate if you practiced righteousness
25:26 -  as a nation she called down all of her house servants and her whole family
25:35 -  and she had me anoint and pray for and bless every single member when I came back the next time to Tanzania
25:45 -  I visited her again she had left office because she could no longer continue
25:54 -  to be part of the conduct of a nation that was not righteous listen you dear saints
26:03 -  we have got to live from every word that proceeds from the mouth of God if he says that he will exalt a nation
26:15 -  that seeks righteousness let's do it if he says seek first the kingdom of God
26:24 -  and his righteousness and all things else will be added up to you let's do it
26:32 -  and see if God will not add and see if God will not add according to his word
26:42 -  if God be not God and his word is not true then what are we doing here
26:52 -  and what is this prayer for Africans if we are not taking God seriously in a way that touched his word
27:01 -  that is promised that we should live by it and believe in it
27:10 -  and see the increase not just in spiritual things but in things of life
27:19 -  because he is concerned for us our bodies as well as our souls no other continent in the world
27:30 -  has as much opportunity to show forth God as God and the truth of his word
27:39 -  and the big words of his promise than this Africa that you are calling
27:48 -  to glorify God by proving him Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil
28:00 -  so we need to see the realization of that defeat to show the powers of darkness
28:09 -  we know that they are defeated we will not be intimidated by them or jerked or manipulated
28:18 -  or live according to their wisdom but according to the wisdom of God which defeated them at the cross
28:27 -  not by aggressive visual violence but by humility and meekness you are called to be
28:39 -  a servant of servants that is not a belittling call that is an ultimate call
28:53 -  yes I know you have been servants you have been forced to be servants but to be servants freely
29:02 -  and voluntarily not begrudgingly to show forth the nature of God
29:14 -  who himself is a servant and wash the feet of his disciples not just as a momentary act
29:23 -  but as a revelation of the truth of his condition because that is what God is as God he is a servant
29:35 -  and you are called to be a servant of servants the world will be blessed by you when you'll recognize your calling
29:49 -  and receive it with gratitude and fulfill it with humility you'll be an example to all nations
30:01 -  God will honor the society who honors him by seeking righteousness
30:10 -  he will do what men cannot do he'll lift disease and poverty he'll reconcile tribal enmity and differences
30:23 -  if we honor his word to perform it the church in Africa needs to demonstrate the radical truth of God's admonitions
30:38 -  to seek first the Kingdom of Heaven and his righteousness and all things will be added
30:47 -  it needs to demonstrate that not just verbally but in its own life and practice
30:56 -  can you imagine such a church the presence of God that will inhabit it that we don't have to stimulate by our own choruses
31:11 -  his presence will melt us because he will honor those who are honoring him
31:21 -  and have dealt with the issue of righteousness in their own life because we're in something together we're in something together
31:34 -  and God will honor by his presence a church that takes his word seriously so as to perform it
31:45 -  not only in the great things but in the little children in relationship to their parents
31:57 -  wives to their husbands husbands to their wives the church to its membership
32:07 -  there are many issues you will not have to look far to find them in which decisions and choices have to be made
32:17 -  and we will not have to look far to find them for or against God in little things
32:29 -  God has so constituted Africa for this very demonstration
32:40 -  that the world will be required to observe the reality of God in Christ by that visible rise of living conditions
32:52 -  not obtained by technology or by charity but supernaturally given by God
33:04 -  in this requirement to honor his own word that when he sees righteousness that when he sees righteousness
33:14 -  he will exalt that nation he will exalt that congregation he will exalt that ministry
33:23 -  he will exalt that continent you dear children we have lived for 31 years in North America
33:35 -  as a community of believers in the piece of land God gave us where within months we had 55 people living there
33:47 -  the conditions of life were hard we needed housing we needed shelter
33:56 -  we needed appropriate clothing we needed nourishment but we had no organizational connection
34:06 -  while the churches elsewhere in America were having great prosperity and God did not allow us to make our needs known
34:21 -  you know what our slogan was? the just shall live by their faith we were tested
34:35 -  in America we were living in the United States but not by the United States
34:44 -  we were a piece of the kingdom of God whose economy was determined from heaven and not from the earth
34:54 -  and not one of us perish you can't imagine our conditions we had a sister who was pregnant
35:05 -  giving birth so we thought we had better plug the car in overnight or the crankcase will freeze
35:19 -  the oil we have electroplasts so that the oil does not freeze
35:28 -  I know you can't imagine it for us that's normal and sure enough
35:38 -  she had birth difficulties and was hemorrhaging and we wanted to get her to the hospital
35:47 -  well the engine started but the gearbox was frozen stiff but she survived
36:01 -  the just shall live by their faith whether in Africa or America God is going to have a people in the earth
36:10 -  who know him, love him, serve him and say with Job yea though he slay me
36:19 -  when will I trust him that's why the Lord opened doors for us Egypt
36:28 -  and other parts of the third world countries many times in Africa but we did not come to them as Americans
36:37 -  yes that's my passport but the truth of my identity is in heaven
36:46 -  amen so I'm not speaking to you abstractly we have paid the price
36:55 -  for this message that you might believe it for Africa
37:04 -  but there's no other answer for Africa it's not going to come through technology or natural resources
37:13 -  don't hope for that it's going to come from God the just shall live by their faith
37:25 -  so Africa is called the dark continent but God intends that it will be the brightest spot in the earth
37:37 -  when the church of Africa rises to assert its moral presence
37:46 -  the leaven of the kingdom and the authority given it by the risen Lord
37:55 -  who said all authority has been given me both in heaven and on earth go ye therefore
38:04 -  into all the world preach this gospel not just a formula for salvation
38:13 -  but a formula for righteousness for keeping the lifestyle for reality
38:22 -  and keeping with God's image but go with the authority
38:31 -  that is already mine go with the authority which is already mine
38:41 -  I'm not sending you out as orphans I have made every provision for Godliness and for life
38:56 -  but it will take your faith to appropriate and to believe for it to insist upon it
39:05 -  to insist upon it realize it, show it forth you don't have to go to a university
39:16 -  you have only to be serious about your own Bible start reading the book of Proverbs every day
39:30 -  today's the 16th, read chapter 16 you'll always come away with some rich truth of a practical kind
39:39 -  that God tells you how to walk what to do with your feet and with your eyes this remarkable instruction
39:48 -  to live a moral, righteous life if we don't ignore it part of the provision
39:57 -  for Godliness and life in chapter 14 of Proverbs God says in verse 31
40:09 -  those who oppress the poor insult their maker and those who are kind to them
40:18 -  honor him being poor in the world is not an accident
40:27 -  it's a sovereign design to test nations and governments
40:39 -  and men on how they treat the weak and the needing
40:48 -  and the helpless and dependent God says to honor them is to honor me now listen to this
41:01 -  if you have the spirit to hear it you see that flag that nation
41:10 -  which you hope to succeed is going to fail is going to be brought down
41:19 -  there's a judgment coming that's necessary to chase in Israel
41:28 -  and to fit it to be a nation of priests and light up to the world Jews are going to be uprooted
41:37 -  all the world over and we read in the prophet Amos I will sift you through all nations
41:49 -  so prepare for the day when it's not just one Jew who comes in here but a number of them
41:59 -  struggling, weak, bruised beat up, despised, hated unclean
42:08 -  wearing filthy rags no opportunity to wash stinking
42:17 -  and Jesus calls them they will be stripped overnight
42:26 -  no matter what their possession they will be made very poor and the attitude of men toward them
42:35 -  will determine their eternal destiny we need now to have a regard
42:44 -  for the poor as being identified with their Maker
42:53 -  and to oppress the poor to exploit them to take advantage of their ignorance
43:02 -  is to insult their Maker that's what the scripture says and we ought to live by it
43:11 -  change our own attitude and not to be contentious of Africans in our midst who are poorer than we
43:23 -  look how ironic this is that those in power in Cameroon today are more contentious
43:35 -  of the poor of their own nation who are Africans, Black than the white colonial powers had ever been
43:47 -  that's a shame for the nation they are more indifferent to their condition unaware and unconcerned
44:00 -  than even the white colonists had been Black does not save you but faith does
44:14 -  so you need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling but not only your own salvation
44:23 -  but Africa's for if the church will not take this to itself
44:32 -  from where shall we expect it the church is the leaven of the kingdom now
44:44 -  it's already the first installment the first expression of a kingdom to come
44:53 -  that is different from the kingdoms of this world because it exalts righteousness because it loves truth
45:02 -  because it's based on humility because it will not yield to violence or to bribery or to corruption
45:11 -  it will believe God rather than to take advantage by paying under the table
45:21 -  God loves those who hate bribery you need to go into the older world to save and restore Cameroon
45:36 -  and what is made in God's image that he might be glorified Africa has a destiny
45:53 -  that it hasn't even begun to understand to glorify God in a way that no other continent
46:03 -  has the possibility the world is not expecting anything from you and you yourself are not expecting
46:16 -  which is a lack of faith to rise to God's intention and to avail yourself
46:26 -  of his every provision his word, his blood, his spirit his fellowship of the believers themselves
46:36 -  and to express a reality of another kind that will affect the nation
46:45 -  and the continent and make it very bright can you believe for that?
46:55 -  that's why God's going to bring Jews through here they would never have come if they had not been uprooted
47:06 -  but Africa will be a highway of holiness for the Lord Chief of the House of Israel where they shall see in black faces
47:18 -  the light that lightens the Gentiles and the glory of the people of Israel they'll be astonished
47:27 -  that you have mercy toward them that you're full of kindness and grace that you're not really guarded private lives
47:37 -  you're an extract of people and you show forth God in a way that Jews would never have expected to find it
47:47 -  not just in the faces of Gentiles the way that I was saved in Europe but in the faces of black Gentiles
47:59 -  up to the demonstration of God's glory where Jews least expect to find it
48:09 -  they'll go from Africa to Zion the redeemed of the Lord will return to Zion with everlasting joy on their heads
48:21 -  and mourning and sighing fleeing away because from the time that they're uprooting and through their typical to the nations
48:32 -  they have seen a demonstration a reality of a moral kind which for them is their very survival
48:46 -  and their salvation and people who are tested and prepared
48:55 -  for a country maturing as sons and daughters who live by faith
49:04 -  and could give their last cup of meal and flour without worrying what will they have left for themselves but because they will give to them first
49:14 -  God will seek to it your oil will not fail it'll be your salvation
49:24 -  you just shall live by this it needs to be getting out I want to pray
49:33 -  for such a church such an example such a model
49:42 -  not just for the nation it will make requirement of you the scriptures will become
49:51 -  much more earnest and sincere you will now need to study to show yourself approved
50:00 -  the work may not be to be ashamed you will not make excuses for yourself you will extend yourself
50:09 -  by faith to grow and increase as the sons and daughters of God and he will honor you
50:18 -  and bless you because you're honoring him who has called you
50:27 -  to more than a succession of services to a kingdom of righteousness
50:36 -  in the earth even now Lord, bless these children
50:45 -  thank you for the word because faith comes by hearing by the word of God
50:54 -  break the power of depression break the power of inferiority of those who have a low self-esteem
51:03 -  we're not capable we can't hope to be like you we're black
51:12 -  Lord, we condemn that we rebuke that demonic spirit we lose your people
51:21 -  to see themselves as accepted in the beloved and esteemed in God's sight
51:30 -  and very precious and called for example, in the world bless this people
51:39 -  and bless this nation for them and bless the continent that darkest Africa
51:48 -  will no more be called darkest but brightest because God is in its midst
51:57 -  as the people of faith who live by him who trust him
52:06 -  who receive their calling and rise to fulfill it in the power of his resurrection
52:15 -  from this night forth seal the word and bring it to our remembrance show us the issues that are moral
52:24 -  that we might attend to them rightly and pleasantly
52:33 -  in your sight even when it's inconvenient we will choose what is right
52:42 -  and not what is easy for we are the church of Jesus Christ in this nation
52:51 -  and this continent Amen
