New Pattern for Living

00:00 -  I don't know if you realize all that's involved. There's a great deal of trembling and rumbling bowels and other things that can't be now enumerated.
00:10 -  It's too much to ask single men to bear that alone. There's fatigue, both physical and spiritual. They're seeking God for His word for this hour, for this people.
00:24 -  It's an enormous responsibility of being an agent of life or death for many. That's too much for single men to bear. And so I hope that you'll be weaned from the practice of three-second afterthoughts for
00:37 -  the ministers that come to your community and that you'll give yourself more fully the supplication and prayer and fasting for the ministers and feel that they're not virtuosos who have some kind of special talent and that somehow, unlike you, they don't tremble before lights and
00:54 -  before cameras and before people. And that you're in it with them and not just called to be a passive spectator and that somehow your responsibility is to undergird them, not just financially but in your prayer
01:09 -  and in the support by the Spirit. I'm just going to ask you to participate in that now. Maybe it will only take three seconds, but let it be an intense three seconds that we're
01:20 -  all in this together. We want to hear from God. We don't want a virtuoso performance.
01:26 -  We want to hear from God. So precious holy God, Lord, speak to us out of your heart. Mighty God, give us to understand the things that please you for this hour.
01:40 -  Open your word to us. Might it be a living, pulsating thing? And mighty God, may we hear also the silences between the words.
01:50 -  May the things that have been left out that have not been articulated or punctuated that pertain to our lives personally, where we are, where no man knows us but you alone. May we hear your voice speaking to that.
02:04 -  Lord, deal with us in the nitty gritty of our lives. Shape us, mold us by what you're going to speak tonight. May it be nothing whatever to do with ceremony or Christian entertainment, but vital things
02:19 -  that pertain to life. And we'll thank you and praise you because you're hearing us now and that you're going to do it and receive all the glory for it in the wonderful name of Jesus.
02:31 -  Amen. Well, chapter 3 of Joshua, and Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from Shittim and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before
02:43 -  they passed over. And they came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host, and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God
02:53 -  and the priests, the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure.
03:04 -  Come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way here to fall. I believe with all my heart that the body of Christ in this moment is encamped along
03:18 -  the banks of the Jordan. And we've been there long enough, and there's a spirit that's speaking to us, commanding us that when we see the ark of God being lifted by the priests and the Levites, that we should
03:33 -  remove from our places and go after it. I know that everything that's instinctive in our nature shrinks from moving. Frau Inge has just one woeful lament of moving time after time in her sojourn with her husband,
03:51 -  from Denmark to California, from California to New York, from New York to Kansas City, from Kansas City back to New York, from New York to Denmark, from Denmark to Israel, from Israel back to New Jersey, and we're afraid that it's not over yet.
04:05 -  It's not an easy thing to move. And I know especially for women, there's just a wonderful, natural thing that desires to be settled.
04:15 -  But this is an unusual hour. I'll tell you that at the end of one of my speaking trips, in the kind of condition of exhaustion both physically and spiritually that I mentioned before, to which you're brought,
04:27 -  I came to a meeting just before my return to Denmark, I'd been three months in the States, and my spirit was really exercised. And some of you know me, that I'm the kind of guy made of God to come on hard, but you
04:40 -  can believe that there's been a lot of tempering process since you've seen me last. And many times I'm given to pause and wonder, is it me or is it God? My face is so flinty and my word is so sharp and uncompromising.
04:55 -  And I was sitting in that kind of tired dejection in body and spirit at this last meeting before I returned to my home in Denmark, and I was so tired I couldn't even participate in the service.
05:06 -  Praise God I wasn't the speaker. I was sitting in the back of the room, and when it was over, the man and wife in whose home that took place came over to me and laid hands on me and prayed for me, and God spoke
05:15 -  a prophecy out of the mouth of this woman. And it said something like this, don't you think that I know how to speak more softly through you when I want?
05:26 -  And I went, whew, thank you, Lord, that it was not me after all, that it was you. Then he went on to say, I'm going to speak even more fierce words than these in your mouth in these end times, and I'm going to beckon men through you to loose their stakes
05:48 -  and pull up their stakes in their tents and to follow on after me. And many there shall be who shall refuse. By the eye of the Spirit, God is asking us tonight to see that there are priests and
06:02 -  Levites who have lifted the ark of God, and it's about to be moved. But I'll tell you that we've been so long on this side of the Jordan that it's become a very familiar and groovy place, has many advantages.
06:16 -  In fact, it was so much so that for two and a half of the tribes of Israel, they never could quite get it all together and cross over to the other side. They were lost forever to the purposes of God and to the people Israel, Gad, Manasseh,
06:32 -  and Reuben, and stayed on the wrong side of the Jordan. Maybe there's a clue in this, in that I understand that they were great men with cattle, and that side of the Jordan had such lush verbiage and growth, and it was so well situated for
06:51 -  grazing that they just couldn't quite bring themselves to cross over. Maybe there's something about the crossing over of rivers that speaks especially to me, a Jew, because the whole history of my people has been nothing but a history of beckonings
07:05 -  to cross over. I understand that the very word Hebrew, the root word aver, has got to do with the meaning of crossing over.
07:15 -  And except that Abraham crossed over, that River Euphrates then left, that Mesopotamian religious civilization and followed God for a wilderness to a land of promise, there would not be a Jew today.
07:29 -  There's always a radical invitation to the people of God to cross a river along which they've camped perhaps far too long and have become too comfortable and too well settled. There shall be a space between you and it, about 2,000 cubits by measure, and some wise
07:47 -  commentator on the scriptures suggests that that might even mean 2,000 years since the advent of the Lord. You have not passed this way heretofore.
08:00 -  This is uncharted territory. This is something scary, something frightening, and if I should just survey my almost 10 years in the Lord, it's been nothing but crossing after crossing after crossing in ways that
08:14 -  I have not been heretofore, and how the Lord has led me with great patience and kindness from the security of the teaching profession, to the lesser security of a missionary organization, to the lesser security of being removed from that organization but still on salary, to
08:31 -  the lesser security of being removed altogether from any connection and being entirely thrust upon him and God's people, which is my condition in this day, to places where we've not been heretofore.
08:44 -  Joshua said to the people, sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you. I want to suggest what it is that lies before us on the other side of the Jordan where we've
08:55 -  not been heretofore. There are so many things that can be spoken, but the thing which the Lord has moved me to put down on this paper this morning has to do with new patterns of living.
09:07 -  I've always been a man of very intense perception. I've always seen things through a kind of peculiar view. I've always been rather simplistic in the way that I see things, and sort of so many
09:21 -  moderating things are eclipsed, and I see things starkly in black and white. And I'll tell you that I have a very intense view of the way that we've been living up till this time.
09:30 -  And the way I see it is this, that our living pattern has been absolutely bizarre, grotesquely distorted, and we've not even suspected it. We've succumbed and submitted ourselves so well without flinching to the pattern of this
09:48 -  world that we thought that this was altogether normal. But I'll tell you that our natures have recoiled against this pattern of private enterprise existence.
10:00 -  A little separate domiciles with little families strangling in their separation and living only unto their own selfishness, glued before TV sets, pouring over Sears Roebuck catalogues, and just living wholly unto themselves, broken only by an hour or two on a Sunday morning
10:20 -  or midweek service, with that occasional travesty called a potluck supper and other such forms of fellowship. This is not the pattern of God.
10:33 -  God has called us to community, and I've never been so conscious of it as I am in this hour. And I speak as a man who temperamentally is constituted to be a loner.
10:45 -  And I flinch and shrink by everything in me which is natural to coming into real relationships with other people. I like to be the kind of guy that comes in like the knight on shining armor into a community
10:59 -  and does his thing and rides out again. But the Lord is not allowing me such luxury. And I'll tell you people, I'm in a very Shakespearean mood, conscience does make cowards of us all.
11:14 -  And if we have to face the root reason why we've shrunk from true community, the answer is simple and not far to be found. We're chickens.
11:22 -  I'm afraid that if you saw me in anything more than my posture behind the pulpit and saw our cat so to speak in his underwear with his knobbly knees sticking out or his mask dislodged or barking at his kids or irritated with his wife, you would be deeply disillusioned.
11:42 -  And indeed, that's exactly what's required. A brilliant man by the spirit by the name of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in a book that's now occupying me called Living Together, isn't that a beautiful title?
11:55 -  Written in the 1930s, well in advance of his time, but written for us now, he says in this book that we must pass through a necessary crisis of disillusionment. Oh people, how we shrink from that.
12:09 -  We don't want to be seen. We don't want our masks jostled. We want to continue our kind of religious posture and somehow we can get by for an hour
12:20 -  with a back slap and a bear hug and all of the other accoutrements of so-called full gospel fellowship. But I'll tell you that something radically changes when we're under each other's roof
12:30 -  in nitty gritty living situations. I wonder why it was that the Lord gave us a 17 room house when we came back from Israel broke.
12:42 -  There's hardly a time that that house has been empty. And I don't mean that men who came to supper staying just for a day or two. I mean we've had one guest, a Danish minister, with us now almost four to five months.
12:56 -  And that man has seen me in every aspect of my life bar none. Couldn't be helped. Talk about being given to hospitality.
13:12 -  There's a continual flow of hospitality at our home. We had a conference on messianic discipleship at our own local congregation and the Jewish kids that came from different parts of the country were taken into the families of the
13:23 -  congregation. And it was one of the greatest blessings of the entire conference face to face with Gentile people.
13:30 -  Beautiful. The things that the Lord transacted through those days under those roofs. We ourselves had over 30 people sleeping in our house and even made dinner on Sunday for
13:40 -  over 60 people. And the conference began Friday night at this little congregation with a matzah ball and traditional Shabbat meal made by Inger and some of the church ladies for over 150 people.
13:52 -  We're being compelled even against our own reluctance to be given to hospitality. And I tell you that I have a sneaky suspicion that if we'll not come to this free willingly, there's a God who is going to use acute shortages to prompt it.
14:15 -  I think that we've been living in a criminal way, in our misuse of resources, in a living as we have with affluence and comfort that would have boggled the mind of the richest potentate in times past, heated to such degrees that you are stuffy and uncomfortable in winter
14:33 -  months and cool to such degrees that you froze and chilled in the summer. We're spoiled, we're soft. We've grown fat and I praise God for the crippling shortages and the severity of the times that
14:51 -  shall soon be upon us. And unlike those clever theologians who feel that somehow when a going really is going to get tough, that somehow we're going to be prickly lifted out, I reject it as nonsense.
15:04 -  And everything in my heart and my spirit and the conduct to which God has brought me in establishing conferences on discipleship for believers who are going to be on the front lines and facing guff and opposition contradicts that happy theory that somehow we're going
15:20 -  to be lifted out and be spared any real trial and affliction. I believe with all my heart, I don't know to what degree and to what length, but we shall face a great time of severity and trial and it's going to do wonders for us.
15:38 -  People we need each other and I'll tell you that among the things that are going to be upon this earth, when men shall be beside themselves with frenzy, when their painful necessity to preserve their own lives, when their naked self-interest is touched as it
15:57 -  has not been touched in comfortable America in our memory, we're going to see masks turned away and teeth bared and ugliness and a kind of conduct that we would not believe possible in the streets of our cities.
16:12 -  Men's hearts shall fail them for fear and we're not going to see human conduct prompted by want of that kind, but we're going to see satanic and demonic spirits attending the frenzy of men.
16:25 -  There's already a pouring out that you cannot believe because God has done such a superb work in this city to shield you and insulate you from some of the fiercer things that are taking place elsewhere.
16:36 -  But I tell you that degrees of temptation so uncanny, so fiendish are going to be poured out on the civilized world and even penetrate the people of God where their defenses are down as you will not believe.
16:49 -  There simply is not going to be any way that we can stand and survive in our own aloneness except that we cleave to each other. We're going to pass through a necessary crisis of disillusionment and face our lives as they
17:04 -  really are however threadbare and begin from there before God in honesty and in truth. We're going to learn what it means to confess our sins, our faults one to another that we might pray one for another that we might be healed and I've always been a kind of a naive
17:21 -  character and from the first time that I ever opened the scriptures I believed and I remember that I came across those scriptures in James confess your fault one to another that you might pray for once another that you might be healed and I never saw an occasion in my
17:35 -  young life as a believer where that was practiced in a church and maybe some of you have heard me give an account of this but it's worth repeating and some of you know the history of my relationship with my son David.
17:48 -  I've got three kids he's the first one and he's the most vexing. I'll tell you what it is about him that bugs me he's just too much like the old man. The spitting image of art cats before he was saved arrogant hot shot little egotist
18:07 -  always got to be in the middle of everything and show off his his little cleverness and it just makes me gnash my teeth in irritation and he just has the most wonderful way to know how to spill the beans at the worst possible moment and make me mad just before I'm going to a service
18:26 -  and going to present myself as God's minister. Well I remember one such occasion it was time to go to the midweek service and David pulled one of his boo-boos I mean it was a monster and I just flipped my lid and I let that kid have it
18:46 -  and I cracked him one and then I had it out with anger who is very defensive about her son. See I'm the I'm the discipline man and she's the one who believes in going easy and this is a source of continual friction and contention
19:03 -  and these are the kinds of things that we're going to have to be resolved before God because these are very real issues. Oh we'd love to discuss esoteric things. Say is the temple going to be rebuilt in Jerusalem? I hear the stones are already cut and locked.
19:16 -  How we thrill to such rumors as that speaking about rumors but when it comes to reconciling our differences with our wives we're not quite as anxious to tackle that. I've had a studied disinterest in prophecy and I've been a disappointment to many. What you're a Jew you
19:36 -  have no interest in prophecy exactly because it's a cop-out for far too many of God's people who love to occupy themselves with very distant things full of excitement and won't pay attention to the things which are at hand. Well anyhow there I went to the service that night and the
19:54 -  last thing I heard from Inge as the door slammed behind me with a loud thought, go tell him what a great man of God you are. I'll tell you that the eye of God rose to and forth over the face of this earth
20:18 -  and he wasn't satisfied until he found Inge in that little town in Denmark and said that's the one for him. Oh you thought your marriage was an accident not made in heaven? You couldn't be more wrong. You thought something was amiss because it's full of abrasive conditions and temperamental
20:38 -  difficulties? Exactly. Isn't the Lord perfect in his wisdom? She is so suited. I may make others cower and others may give me grand introductions and and acknowledgments but to Inge who's seen me in my underwear. So I remember driving to that service that night my heart was like lead. I was
21:07 -  so sick sick sick of these repeated episodes over David how I couldn't control my temper over this kid how he bugged me he was my Achilles heel and it always eventuated and resulted in an argument with Inge and I was just driving like a like a dead man to that church and I came in late
21:25 -  and the service was already in progress they were taking testimonies you know the way we do. Yes sister Jones well I just want to praise the Lord this week he's such a wonderful savior to me and you know I don't mean to disparage testimonies but you know what I'm talking about
21:48 -  there's so much in our life that's anxious ceremonial nonsensical far better we had stopped our mouths and had us had a service in complete silence before God then we should go through such motions as that as a matter of fact we had a minister come from Argentina to whom God gave a
22:05 -  revelation of what the Church of God ought to be he was a very successful pastor and here's how he acted on his revelation he called the moratorium on all services for three months that is that the congregation still continued to meet but they stopped singing hymns they stopped going through
22:22 -  their anxious prayers they stopped hearing pretty sermons and they waited on the Lord now I'll tell you there's nothing more excruciating than silence he wouldn't allow his congregation to use the word Lord because every time a speaker came to town and they had a shop around for a place
22:37 -  to put them up people kind of wrinkled up their noses and they complained that Aunt Suzy was in town at the same time or their kid had a cough or the plumbing wasn't working or something like that they called Jesus Lord but the fact of the matter was that they were the Lord over their own homes
22:54 -  their own substance their own cars their own leisure their own privacy their own lives he forbade them to use the word Lord until Jesus became Lord indeed there's been an explosion in that church since there's been a revolution there are people who will die for each other
23:12 -  who readily will lay down their lives there's no such thing as a man believing that his home is his own or the things which he has are his own they have they hold all things in common and there's such a manifestation of the power of God upon this people and God is adding to their number daily such
23:28 -  as should be saved our life pattern is a bizarre distortion of God's original intention I can't tell you as a visiting man going from town to town how many homes I've stayed and can't even find a place to hang up my suit in the closet it's so jammed full of goodies in plastic bags
23:48 -  people there's a new pattern you've not been this way before and it's going to require expanded families it's going to require liberal hospitality it's going to require not looking upon the things which we have as being our own and be willing to give men the coats of our back and
24:06 -  the money out of our savings account I'll tell you there's been such a flow of money through me in this past year I can't believe it but it's not stopped there it's just flowed and a young couple of my acquaintance a Jewish wife and an Irish husband
24:24 -  spiritually believes wanted to buy a house poor kid struggling didn't have the money for the closing costs a thousand dollars like nothing our cats writing out a check for a thousand dollars can you believe depression baby who used to pinch pennies and watch carefully to see that
24:42 -  not too much toilet paper is taking I'll tell you that's kid stuff it's only the beginning of things except that there's a flow of substance from God from whom every good and perfect gift comes through us we're going to be a source of grief to him and impede the working of God in the
25:04 -  end times I think we're going to see our living patterns radically altered we're going to be thrust upon each other in ways we could never have anticipated many of us may be losing our homes when the economy is going to suffer a great contraction maybe there'll be a loss of employment
25:18 -  maybe we'll have to take whole families into our homes maybe we'll have to share with them and feed them and share our clothing and cars and all that we have I'll tell you that at a recent conference at the conclusion we wanted to have a Lord's Supper in my hotel room it was a hot summer's
25:33 -  day and the air conditioning had gone out and to my what's the word consternation more than the people who were invited came and they came with their little snotty kids and I was irritated and the air conditioning was out and they were sitting on my bed on the floor by the doorway
25:49 -  in the bathroom and it was rather uncomfortably crowded and I thought well let's get get over with this but I'll tell you the Spirit of God began to move and we went on and on in singing the hymns of the church and praying to our God and blessing one another in speaking out of the
26:08 -  words in breaking bread and passing the cup that we didn't want the hour to end and when it was over you know what I thought to myself I was irritated at first because of the crowd it wasn't something that I would have designed but once it happened I came not only to enjoy it but to love
26:27 -  it and I was reluctant when it ended God is going to radically change our living patterns and we've not been that way here too far so I came to church that I was sitting in church they're taking these testimonies and in my heart I heard a still small voice saying confess your faults one to another
26:41 -  confess your faults one to another and I try to put that voice down and finally I found my hand going up and I was getting hot spells and cold spells and my knees were knocking and the pastor told me oh brother cat the Jewish believer oh he's going to bless us yes brother cat
27:01 -  I got up I went purple green red I've I said since I came to the service tonight I've been hearing one voice over and over repeating confess your fault one to another confess your faults one to another I have to admit that I'm a simple believer and I've never seen this done in any
27:18 -  congregation and I don't know when the propitious time is for such obedience but I just feel that I have to confess a fault right now you could have cut the silence with a knife that poor pastor was dumbstruck and then I went on to tell him the unhappy incident with David and I was really
27:40 -  truthful I told him it wasn't an isolated event it was a repeated occurrence and it was bugging me to death and I was unable to do anything about it I said it was conduct unbecoming a father and beyond that it was conduct unbecoming a child of God and beyond that it was conduct
27:57 -  unbecoming a servant of God would they pray for me and I sat down I would have hoped that the floor would have opened and swallowed me there was such a silence the first time I ever saw the pastor not knowing what to say and in that silence finally a woman got up on the other side of the
28:16 -  congregation and she confessed the fault and I don't exactly remember what happened after that we were all kind of born up by the spirit but we all found ourselves on our feet praying one for another and it was pure undistilled glory oh precious people let's not be speakers of the word
28:36 -  only but doers and there's a God who's calling us in this hour to the nitty gritty application of the word to our lives just where we live it we've not been that way here too far and we're going to be loathed to pull up the stakes and follow after but I tell you that the ark of God
28:55 -  is being lifted by the priests and by the Levites are you seeing it by the eye of the spirit and will you be willing to lengthen your cords and follow after please don't be among the two and a half tribes who just quite couldn't make it and were lost forever to the purposes of God
29:15 -  and you know what kind of God we have when does he tell us to cross we're supposed to cross at flood stage in the 15th verse reading as they bear the ark they that bear the ark will come into Jordan
29:33 -  and the feet of the priest that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for the Jordan overflow us all his banks all the time of the harvest so what is it with this God can he invite us to cross when it's just that little muddy stream which it is just about almost every month
29:51 -  out of the year but harvest time those of you who've been to Israel have seen the Jordan have been profoundly disappointed it really is a muddy stream and most times of the year you just roll up your cuffs and your tippy toe your way through but there's something about God if you understand
30:05 -  his way that always requires the crossing of rivers of separation not when it can be done tippy toe but when it's a foreboding torrent and we're incapable of crossing in our own strength and will therefore he's got to go before and part the waters and make what is a river of death
30:27 -  a pathway unto life if we will follow after and I believe that the Jordan to which God shall call us in this hour is going to be a river of seeming death in extremity and vexation and wrath that is going to be increasingly built up in a world which is an enmity with God in a period when the
30:48 -  mask is going to be off in this age of radical extremity and we're going to see unveiled the ages-old enmity of a world that hates God it's been concealed far too long in this hanky panky game of the so-called three great faiths but we're going to see men vicious against the children of
31:07 -  God because they're no longer just a mild thing of indifference to contemplate who go for potluck suppers and attend services on a Sunday but they stand as as what they shall construe to be as obstacles in the path of civilization in an hour when it's struggling for its very existence
31:25 -  are you understanding what I'm saying we're coming into an age of extremity and crisis not only for the want of energy but basic commodities for civilization for order that there's going to be turmoil and and breakdowns at every hand economic political social confusion
31:43 -  and strife and every kind of vexation and paradoxically it's going to come as a very time when we need leadership the most and it's not to be found when our leaders themselves are suspect and there's been a decline a declension in authority to whom they shall return
31:59 -  and here is the here are these foolish little people that are going to stand in the midst of this roaring tyrant and say christ is the answer I'll tell you men shall mash upon us with their teeth and the attitude which now prevails in the soviet union shall prevail here we're going to be
32:14 -  looked upon as dangerous enemies of society given to superstition and fanaticism men whose reason has deserted them and who don't realize that this age requires solemn solutions that have to do with economics and politics and IBM computers and talk about calling upon the Lord and seeking
32:38 -  his face it's a river a very fearful river that God is going to ask us to cross it's the river that was referred to when he said that we shall be hated of all nations for his namesake and I'll tell you that as a Jew I have a suspicion that a lot of the terror that has to do with this river
32:59 -  of death will be brought about by issues pertaining to the Jewish people in a recent trip I came to a town and a woman told me after the meeting Archie said I want to share something with you I had a nightmare not long ago I said what was it she said I dreamt that there was a furious pounding on my
33:16 -  door at something like four in the morning a furious insistent pounding and and the sound that she said terrified me and she said we hurriedly the whole family came down in their night clothes to see what this disturbance was and we opened the door and men just brushed past us and
33:31 -  and knocked that door open and they were masked hooded men and they demanded that we get dressed and we leave immediately with them we couldn't take a single possession and then they bundled us and tied us up and threw us in the back of the car and we drove off in the in the midst of the
33:44 -  night and she said I was I was paralyzed with fear and I cried out to these men why are you doing this she cried and the answer was you are among those who love the Jewish people I believe that one of the phenomena of the end times is going to be a furious state of anti-semitism
34:04 -  and we can see the delineations already the thing is beginning to form crippling energy crisis many countries already forbidding people the use of their cars on Sundays imagine should it come to river city where we've long habituated ourselves to taking our car out
34:22 -  any cotton picking time we want to this is a free country and all of a sudden to be told you cannot it's against the law and having a mumbling under our breath and being very churlish and what are we going to say damned Arabs no we're going to hear damned Jews
34:42 -  Israel is going to become a bone in the throat of the nations of the world and I believe that this is going to be one among several factors of irritation in the world emanating from this difficulty in the Middle East and other factors when this economic crisis how do people's minds
34:58 -  begin to gravitate how shall they look on prosperous Jewish merchants and there's going to be a Satan who is going to work this to death for all its potential where shall you stand on that day who are kindly affectioned toward Israel now I'll tell you to stand with the Jewish people
35:18 -  then is to mock you as a hated person as much as they and a lot of you are going to cop up it's okay now to palpitate in a schmaltzy way toward Israel but how will you do it when it's going to cost you I'll tell you in the Nazi time children betrayed their own parents out of fear
35:37 -  for the authorities and didn't so much as bat an eyelash when brown shirted Hitler youth came and pulled the beards of elderly Jews and broke still windows and painted swastikas on apartment houses and beat up Jewish kids they pulled their shade and looked the other way self-preservation
35:55 -  there's a river that God is going to ask us to cross a fearful foreboding river and is going to be at red stage because it's harvest time and if we are trying to follow out the scriptures you would find in Jeremiah 12 5 and 49 19 that there's a reference that at the time of the
36:13 -  overflowing of the Jordan that the lions are out roaring there they were in the thickets but when the waters begin to overspill the banks and these lions become rested and they begin to roar it's a fearful thing and many shall be intimidated and turned back from the crossing of this Jordan
36:34 -  oh there are so many things that I could speak about what the Jew is going to mean in this end time we've seen it already with t73 and the great outcries from rabbinical sources and not rabbinical sources only but liberal churchmen uprating us who call ourselves Christians and
36:49 -  saying you call this Christian love trying to persuade a Jew to become a Christian and forsake his Jewishness say haven't they suffered enough in the Holocaust and aren't they struggling to retain their Jewish identity in Russia are you two going to deny them their right to be Jews
37:03 -  and make Christians out of them anti-semite boy I can see the Adam's apples bubbling all over Christendom as the crescendo of fury and anger rises of the issue of bringing the gospel to the Jews in the last times there's a fearful river of crossing to which God is bringing us but I'll
37:24 -  tell you that it will follow after our Joshua our Yeshua we shall go over as on dry ground it's interesting the last verse of this third chapter and the priest that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan and all the Israelites
37:39 -  passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan how are you doing there priests say aren't you just salivating and waiting for your moment when the Lord's going to bring you into ministry I want to tell you something about being a priest of God you are
37:56 -  the first one into the Jordan and you're the last one out oh you think it's an idle thing to stand there with two banks of water threatening at any moment to inundate you in a crush to life out of you oh it's one thing to read it in the scriptures it's another thing to stand there in the midst
38:13 -  and watch this these pulsating banks of water threatening any moment to let go and you're waiting while Israel crosses over two and a half million it's a long wait you're the first one in and you're the last one out and there are men sitting in this audience
38:31 -  tonight who are among those in Kansas City who are the first ones in it was a frightening prospect to contemplate a baptism in the Holy Spirit and you suffered all kinds of ridicule and reproach from those of your denomination some of you may even have suffered being cast out of your
38:48 -  denominations and losing your privilege and your place you were the first ones in and I'll tell you something else you'll be the last ones out just a little afterthought before we leave that third chapter less you should like me one day pray oh God I cried out make me as Paul and before
39:07 -  the words were out of my mouth I was clutching desperately to shove them back in and swallow hot because the words were no sooner out of my mouth than I remembered what kind of a life Paul lives how many times was he beaten stone shipwreck left the dead fast things off
39:27 -  bearing the burden of the whole church shame persecution reproach motted them oh I'd love the glory of his ministry but I wasn't quite prepared for the price of it you want to be a priest of God you'll be the first one in and the last one out
39:44 -  and I'll tell you when we cross the Jordan people I know a lot of us have been waiting to cross the Jordan hallelujah the promised land we've been in this wilderness long enough praise God milk and honey we've arrived but say have you heard tell about the enemies that are in the lands
40:01 -  the canaanites the hittites the hivites the parasites the gegeshites the amorites and the jebusites ancestral enemies of the people of God fierce contenders against things which are holy taunters and jeers seducers tempters oh we thought the struggle was over but I tell you when we'll
40:20 -  cross the other side of Jordan it'll be a struggle against those fleshly enemies in such ferocity and intensity as we've never known it and the first thing that stands in the way is this imposing city Jericho why man the ramparts are 35 feet thick and these dilutes stand they
40:38 -  look to be like 12 feet tall with armor and breastplate and helmets and what are we but a skinny bunch of runts weaned in the wilderness and we're going to take that city walking seven times around with a shot talk about absolute foolishness and absurdity but i'll tell you
40:56 -  that there's something that awaits us before we take the cities that stand in the way in the possessing of the land for God and it's called circumcision and praise God you've got an authority before you because it says in the fifth chapter of joshua at the second verse at
41:16 -  that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel to hill of the fourskins and then he goes on to explain why that they were never circumcised
41:30 -  in the wilderness and in the seventh verse they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass that when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the lord said unto joshua this day
41:44 -  have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you i want to say a little word about circumcision maybe some of you have heard me speak on this subject before but i'll tell you that as a jewish man i never get two thoughts about it why it's so customary aspect of our life that that you don't
42:01 -  have to contemplate it isn't that characteristic also of so much that pertains to our spiritual life we don't have to contemplate it it becomes almost habitual we can recite it standing sideways we go through services and and give assent to catechisms and and doctrines without batting in
42:19 -  my lash but i tell you this is a season when God is calling us to examine the root the foundations of our faith and to look again at the things which have been customary and glib well God gave me such an occasion with circumcision because david was born in denmark and however progressive a country
42:36 -  that is they don't practice circumcision isn't that strange the whole world has adopted it as a universal hygienic practice and here's this progressive country and they don't do it so i had to make a special request to have my son circumcised and i did it and i went and i told
42:49 -  linda i said the sweetie i've seen the doctor and the day is going to be circumcised tomorrow and and she said what's that you know there's something about gentiles that just constitutionally doesn't quite dig on circumcision you remember moses his wife zepora who flung the fourskins at his feet
43:08 -  and said oh is our bloody husband she was offended in her gentile soul because there's something about the nature of cutting and the shedding of blood which is offensive to the carnal nature and then he said what's that i said oh it's nothing sweet and they just go you know just a
43:24 -  little cut and and that's it she said cut i said you know the foreskin and i tried to explain and i watched ingras face change talk about a stricken woman she went absolutely pale and her eyes became wider sources and she looked at me as if she had married a dracula
43:46 -  had she known the scripture she would have cried oh our bloody husbands you want to know something david has never been circumcised because the tears rolled down her cheeks and bounced off the floor and i simply didn't have the heart to do it but i'll tell you
44:02 -  as a result of that episode i began to wonder why it is that she reacted so severely what is it that moved to the tears like that and and and smote her soul well the strange thing was that uh we finally came to america and my mother had the great pleasure and the knock is the satisfaction
44:19 -  of seeing her grandson she never thought anything good could come out of me and so i remember one day my mother was changing david's diaper the first time when she opened the diaper and she looked down oh
44:31 -  and i saw the same stricken face the same eyes as large as a saucer the same half-eyed expression but for exactly the opposite reason for her it was absolutely natural and necessary i'm thinking for a child not to be circumcised and i began to look at the reactions of the two women
44:53 -  and pondered the question of circumcision in my soul and i recognized instinctively flesh shrinks against cutting and yet God has earth ended a lot of you are wondering say what happened to you after you left kansas city we saw you off and you were born up on angels wings and
45:11 -  we heard some reports in new york and then all of a sudden we found out that you left new york and you left this organization and you went to denmark and what were you doing there and then after someone's day you went to Israel what happened there i'll tell you what happened people i was
45:25 -  having my flesh cut away and i just have to impose a discreet silence and i can't tell you the painful ways that God made a sharp knife and cut away at my flesh this morning i shared with the fellows and one of the last messages i had given at a full gospel convention had such a fantastic response
45:47 -  that there were two lines of people waiting to greet me when i got off the platform one waiting with 30 arms around my neck that they had passed from death to the life and hearing and responding to it and the others ready to string me up and and slay the flesh from my bones for showing
46:01 -  confusion in the body of christ what a torment and the accusations and i was such an innocent i didn't realize that my words were that well attended and and the special delivery letters that i got with the accusations and the photo status scriptures to show me my error
46:17 -  and the harassing long distant phone calls by a jewish brother on jewish holidays to show me that how i had sinned against God and God was absolutely silent cutting cutting cutting or is a great thing to be a young jewish believer and give my testimony and bring blessings but the lord
46:35 -  made me to understand i had passed a certain line and it was not just the blessing of testimony but the word of God being proclaimed and there was a heavy responsibility to be his messenger it costs and many other things can i tell you what it means to live in a country like denmark where
46:52 -  you can't speak the language and have the more defined experience sitting like a lump of lead like a dummy and hearing the conversation flow over you and there's no way for you to participate in your wife's family who are all unsaved or having to speak to a translator and not being
47:09 -  able to really express your burden through him the frustration of the of the word being choked up and impeded in in your heart and in your spirit many such modifications and what shall i say about what God did in my marriage and in my relationships with my wife and with my kids
47:24 -  the cuttings the painful surgery the things that were excruciating but needful i gotta give it to you straight if you're going to lose your stakes and follow after the priest to a bear in the ark the first thing that shall await you when you shall cross through that river of death which
47:41 -  itself is a fearful proposition is the cutting away of flesh with a sharp knife that you might be made whole and find your place in the camp there's not a soul in this room that is not marked for God for a concrete and specific place in his body but you'll never come to it until you first
48:01 -  submit yourself to a separation from the wilderness and to a necessary cutting of flesh that you might be made whole and find your place in the camp and march with the army of God to take the jericho's that stand in our path i'll tell you what happened just a month or two ago
48:17 -  at a meeting like this one when it was over a man came to me heaving a sigh of relief he said already said this morning i cried out to God he said lord how long i said what are you saying brother he said you can't believe what my torment i've been suffering for two years i said how so he said i'm
48:34 -  an engineer and in the area of my own competence i don't understand what's happening i've become like that like a like an idiot like an uncompensated i can't perform the most simple and elementary tasks i've been demoted and cruelly humiliated before my colleagues and doing the kind of work
48:49 -  that a high school dropout could do i said how long have you been suffering this he says it's been about two years now ever since i got up at that full gospel convention at your message and rose to your invitation and the moment he said that the spirit of God came upon me and the lord
49:03 -  said tell the man tell the brother i saw him when he rose and all that he's been experiencing these two years has been a response to his commitment the poor man thought that the lord had forsaken him he didn't realize that this was the most exquisite expression of God's love in paring
49:20 -  away the flesh that he might be brought to a place that he should have no confidence in the flesh and trust only in him i could have told him out of my own experience wasn't i a hot shot high school teacher did i have the kids eating out of my hand as an atheist wasn't i one of the most
49:39 -  popular men on faculty what a mouthpiece i had and what a winsome personality until i got saved then i came back from jerusalem and resume my teaching profession and it was the strangest thing in the areas of my greatest sense and competence i was tongue-tied well before i
49:55 -  used to be articulate all of a sudden i was gasping and choking and sputtering i couldn't put two words together i used to have a winsome personality before i now i turn the kids off like nobody's business i was icky in the areas where i used to shine all of a sudden i'd grown dull
50:09 -  and it was nothing but torment and God wasn't quick to alleviate my pain but some months later he brought a servant who understands the way of God and i just poured my heart out i don't know what's the matter i received the lord he's forsaken me he said what's the matter i told him just like
50:25 -  this engineer he said ah don't you understand that in the area of your own competence and self-assurance God has had to strip you people if you're impressed in any way with what you're hearing tonight and attribute it to me or any talent or skill that i have you could not be more
50:42 -  wrong i tell you that at any given moment should God lift this anointing i'll be the most tongue-tied fool that you ever heard you'll rise in your seat with discomfort and irritation and look at you watch waiting to get out of this mess for me to live is christ i am crucified
51:03 -  with christ cut in the areas of my own competence and self-assurance painfully cut nevertheless i live yet not i but christ lives in me you know the man said to me the other day eating dinner at his home the general manager of a christian television network he said art when you talk about the end
51:23 -  times and all of these severe things that are going to come upon us he says how should we survive always said no i know what you're going to tell me spiritually but practically speaking God how are we going to survive i said brother thank you for that question thank you for confirming
51:39 -  what i've all along suspected you are so representative of the whole body of christ we have hypothetical spiritual solutions and we're quick to quote watchman knee and talk about the cross and about submission but it's all theoretical it's all verbal and phraseological but not actual
51:59 -  and when it comes to the actual substance of our lives we're not one with different from those in the world but i'll tell you here's what i said to the brother and i say to you God is bringing us to such an age of extremity that i accept the spiritual solution be our real solution we shall
52:17 -  perish it's not going to be enough to cluck our tongues wistfully in the reading of the accounts of elijah of how he was fed by ravens we ourselves shall be so led by such a spirit and be fed supernaturally or we shall perish and the learning to walk by the spirit and to discern the voice of
52:36 -  God begins not in crisis it begins now just in the same way that i had to come up tonight believing that what i jotted on this page at six o'clock this morning needs to be spoken and ready to suffer embarrassment and mortification and death of disappointment to many in this room
52:56 -  who are kind toward me and love me and respect me and think that i'm some kind of spokesman and ready to that they might if we be suffer a crisis of disillusionment i took my frail life in my hands and believe God and i'm speaking it so too shall you uh someone said something tonight
53:16 -  about introducing a layman introducing the clergy well this is not clergy speaking people this is layman speaking this is just old art this is just the high school dropout the brooklyn boy made good this is just the guy who's been following after the same God you're following after
53:32 -  and try to complain lord i'm not qualified and i've not been to a school of theology or a bible school and i don't know how i can stand and talk to my jewish people and to rabbis and to contend against them but God said come and so says he unto you there's an oath being lifted by the priest
53:51 -  of God and you've not been that way here too far and when you follow the first thing shall await you when you cross over the other side is a fearful cutting away of the flesh i believe that the cutting away of the flesh people in a word is going to mean intense personal dealings of God
54:09 -  and i've already alluded to some of these dealings that pertain to our marriages and i want to tell you this take a deep breath because if your marriage is built upon the rock of happy accidental temperamental compatibility you've had it sorry the lord is not going to allow that house to stand
54:31 -  neither can it stand in an age of great distress and extremity or you've been getting a little groovy up till now but what have you had to suffer start suffering some crippling things and that sweet little docile wife that you thought was still just uh submitted is going to snarl like
54:47 -  a tiger when her security is jeopardized and you never suspected what you had on your hands she was so sweet so long as she had full sway to buy this and to go there and her lifestyle was not one width impeded and what shall we say of you fellows who could put your feet up on the
55:04 -  hassock and watch the football game on sunday in color and have the oil this in heaven too when you're going to start getting pinched i tell you that it's going to be a revelation there are great winds that are going to blow with increasing ferocity and God is not going to allow
55:21 -  us to survive because of happy accidents there's only one rock upon which the house of our marriages and our life can be founded and that rock is christ Jesus i would to God that this were not on film and i pray that no one's going to call anger writer about the personal confessions that i'm making
55:39 -  but a lot of you remember inga and to every outward appearance what a sweet girl how quiet and meek and submitted to her kind of a glorious husband and when you read the book ben Israel you know just willing to follow me to the ends of the earth et cetera et cetera where did you read
55:58 -  the sequel i'll tell you something that's happened in the course of recent years and we're beginning to recognize that that wasn't really the true inga and there's a lot of things that were me that were not the true art either there's a God who's pulling back the veil and a lot of
56:16 -  what can i say ugly maybe too strong a word a lot of real but unhappy things are being evidenced but there's a God who's dealing with them and every dealing is painful i would regard that the process could be avoided i would regard that we could wave a magic wand over our marriage
56:32 -  and live happily ever after and somehow all of these deep differences and things going back to childhood and all these complex strands that make up our psyche and and emotions in life somehow could be glossed over but they can't there's a God who's bringing us to an hour of intense
56:50 -  personal dealings i want you to know that that's one way to interpret the circumcision which we shall have to face and i'll tell you another maybe i'm a frontiersman and i tell you this with a certain sense of embarrassment and shame there's a God who's calling us to holiness isn't
57:08 -  it interesting that as the world shall grow more dark our lights shall be required to shine all the more brightly where's an isaiah word says a thick gloom in the darkness shall cover the earth but arise and let your light shine and i'll tell you there's been already great penetration of the
57:27 -  spirit of the world in the body of christ great areas of compromise of concession of deceit and it shows in our appearance and our styles and our speech i remember the recent meeting like this i came to a point in my message where we needed to cry out to God for revival and just when i
57:43 -  came to the revival my eye inadvertently fell on a young girl sitting in the front row whose legs were crossed she wasn't just wearing a mini skirt it was a micro skirt right up to the crotch and somehow my words just kind of gag right in my throat and i just felt like closing my bible and
57:59 -  walking off the platform talking to God and crying out for revival with our dresses up to our crotch and i'll tell you that's only a symbolic expression of conditions that apply to both sexes in the body of christ there's a God who's going to call us to a high standard of personal
58:17 -  high standard of personal holiness in the end terms and those things to which we've become habituated that have to do with concession compromise deceit personal gratification areas that are private intimate that we sort of glossed over and thought that the sanction of marriage
58:36 -  covered God is going to put his finger upon and cut away do i have to become more explicit i'll tell you something that if wherever we're vulnerable and susceptible to lust wherever we palpitate for the gratification of our own flesh we're going to experience such intense pressures
58:56 -  from the enemy as you will not believe i'll tell you i think basically speaking i'm as healthy and as masculine as just about any man who walks but God has given me occasion to see in recent weeks and months months that except for the grace of God i could be almost instantly plunged into
59:17 -  such a character of sin of the most low kind so uncanny and intense are the satanic pressures that are coming against the priests of God who the first one's in and the last one's out i speak to you as a frontiersman to those who are being beckoned tonight to pull up your stakes and
59:38 -  follow after if you're vulnerable and your flesh is exposed satan is going to mercilessly attack it and therefore God has got to cut away all flesh there's going to be a personal holiness in small things because the reproach of egypt has got to be rolled away off of God's people
01:00:01 -  well it's interesting as we come to the conclusion and there's so much in there i'm just trusting that lord knows what he's doing and speaking those things that he wants and leaving other things out we've talked about faith a great deal and i'll tell you we've made
01:00:14 -  cheap goods out of it and in the same way that we've demeaned and deprecated other aspects of the walk with God we hardly know what it means anymore like a titillation or we think it's got to do with sensation or feeling faith faith faith we talk liberally and nonsensically but i'll tell
01:00:30 -  me end times in the taking of the land faith is going to be a very real thing it's going to be so real a thing as walking every day around the jericho's that stand in our path in burning sun in heat in thirst trudging really around this jericho and then only to repeat it the next day
01:00:50 -  and every day what are we treated to men jeering at us from the ramparts you think you're going to take this city by faith foolish men whoever heard of walls falling by walking and then you know they go on like that you're going to get disillusioned you're going to get sick in your spirit in your
01:01:07 -  soul you're going to get exhausted and tired you're going to be tempted to throw the whole thing over but God is calling us to that perfect number seven times around and seven times on that last day and the priests of God when they blow that trump there's going to be one shout
01:01:23 -  and i'll tell you it had better be a shout or instead of the walls falling down those fierce monsters are going to come down and crush the very life out of us we had better be in one spirit and one accord in that day and whatever there is that divides us now which we've glossed over which we
01:01:40 -  tolerate and which we avoid God is not going to allow we're going to find ourselves bedfellows with those who roll in seardust and we never could have had fellowship with them before they're extremists and emotional or those of us who looked on our noses as pentacostals
01:01:58 -  at those that come out of the denominations and they're too staid and circumspect or whatever our objection was or we didn't care for jewish believers they seemed to be too arrogant and heady and high-minded or we didn't we couldn't quite make it with black people and we thought
01:02:12 -  maybe a good idea if they had their congregations we have ours in that day people the shout that shall go off in the body of christ has got to be one shout seven times around and when the trump trumpet blows there's going to be a shout and the walls are come down and it's interesting that it
01:02:28 -  says in that sixth chapter the 20th verse of the people's shadow when the priest blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the
01:02:43 -  city every man straight before him and they took the city every man straight before him you don't have a sneaky suspicion intuition that when that wall of spiritual difficulty falls in that last day in that great shout and every man goes in straight before him he's going to take the city
01:03:02 -  in that place that was the sourest vexation of his spiritual life difficulty in your marriage a difficulty in your relationship a habit a problem whatever it is when the world falls will go straight into that area that has long stood in the way and will take the city and i'll
01:03:18 -  tell you when we'll take it God's judgment is merciless and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both men and women young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword oh you say odd is a typographical error our God cannot be that cruel i tell you that God's judgment
01:03:34 -  is upon all flesh and they that live in the flesh cannot please God the judgment is complete and the jericho's must be destroyed in the way and then we go on to the next and the next until we've taken the land you say art man you've exhausted me tonight i came encouraged and
01:03:53 -  looking for blessing and then i'm just worn out contemplating what lies ahead and therefore i want you to turn with me in conclusion to that precious book keep your hand in joshua go back for a moment but hebrews the 12th chapter isn't that the the chapter that precedes it is so glorious
01:04:12 -  all the great heroes of faith who sweated who bled who sacrificed who died in the building of the kingdom of God choosing to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season a stimulating approach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt
01:04:31 -  for they had respect under the recompense of the reward by faith moses and those like him forsook egypt and all that egypt connotes not fearing the wrath of the king just like elijah who stood without trembling before ahab for they endured as seeing him who is invisible 12 chapters hebrews
01:04:51 -  wherefore seeing we also encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses do you realize it this very night invisible to our sight this sanctuary is compassed about by a great cloud of witnesses abraham isaac jacob Paul peter john every unknown unnamed saint of God who has sweated
01:05:18 -  bled suffered died to build the kingdom of God are looking upon us that generation that shall complete the race that was set before us that generation that at long last is called to leave the wilderness of denominational nonsense and christian play acting and full gospel entertainment
01:05:39 -  and all the rest of that jazz and take the land for christ's sake and before there's the enjoyment of the milk and honey there are going to be some fierce battles fought in the possessing of the land and the whole object was not as we thought to gratify us but that in the taking of the land
01:05:57 -  there's a certain mount called zion and on that mount God is going to build a temple and this temple the stones are already cut high stones you're being chipped and shaped even now and when the land is possessed and mount zion is available the lord is going to put it all together
01:06:19 -  a sanctuary for the enriches your kind of glory shall dwell made up of jews and gentiles and black and white and fat and skinny and people of every nation and tongue and climb and the law shall go forth again out of zion praise God an end at last to anarchy
01:06:40 -  and chaos and filth and nation against nation and greed and poverty and disease and every kind of crippling contamination that has rendered this earth and full of blood the law shall go forth out of zion alike the chicano glory of God shall break forth from the holy of holies when the land
01:07:03 -  is possessed we're circled about tonight with a great cloud of witnesses so let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith before the joy that
01:07:22 -  was set before him endured the cross with stising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him i just want to say in conclusion tonight as i ask you to turn to the to joshua the fifth chapter consider him people i don't know whether it's because
01:07:47 -  i'm an erinite or a levite or i'm a catz a koansaric a righteous priest is what that means in hebrew but i've had a regard from the moment that i was saved for the sanctuary of God for the holiness of God i always grimaced and winced at the easy kind of language that christians use
01:08:09 -  about Jesus as if they're talking about their buddy he's the holy one of Israel and i think one of the greatest priorities for us as believers in this end time that will enable us to endure is to see him who is invisible and i'm sick to the teeth of that spate of portraits of what they call
01:08:29 -  the masculine christ or the effeminate christ or the christ with wispy blonde hair much imitated now in our generation long strands very appealing and all the other kinds of affectations that got that have to do with a visible christ that misses the mark by a million miles worn on t-shirts
