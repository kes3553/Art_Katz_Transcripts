The Scandal of Specificity

00:00 -  It's the word that Paul used because it's not evidently disclosed to our understanding and there needs to be something from God the Revealer to apprehend this which is at the heart of his faith. So I make two disclaimers from the beginning.
00:16 -  Unless you think that I'm choosing a subject because I'm Jewish, I have a special affinity, that's not so. I often say if the Lord had chosen another people, I would be celebrating his choice. But the fact of the matter is, I should not deny that choice, lest you think that I'm partial to it because I am Jewish.
00:35 -  It's a strange ambivalence, intention, contradiction, but God is a God who chooses. Remember, there are two trees in the garden and gave us the issue of choice, and that was the pregnant issue that would determine rebellion or fellowship.
00:53 -  And when he calls Israel his chosen people, his chosen nation, we need to pay a special attention to what God chooses, because in his choosing he reveals himself as God. And some have called this the scandal of specificity, because they don't like when God gets that particular.
01:14 -  They like when we can generalize, when he doesn't mean this, he doesn't mean Zion as a particular point or physical place in the geography of Israel. Zion is a more general term that describes the people of God in every generation, et cetera, et cetera.
01:28 -  There is a sense, and a significant and valid sense, in which the word Zion can stand for the people of God. But there is also a literal and geographic intention of God that must not be displaced by the secondary and spiritual consideration. I'm giving you a principle of hermeneutics or interpretation, because the issue of interpretation is critical.
01:52 -  And Israel has essentially the ethnic specific choice of God. This particular people with a particular history, a particular location, and a particular destiny has been shunted by the Church historically, right through to this present Allah,
02:08 -  and because of the scandal of the specificity of God's choice. And if I can sense the wisdom of the heart of God in making such a choice, he said, I didn't choose you because you were the greatest, I chose you because you were the least.
02:25 -  Because in choosing you as the least, in choosing Zion as the place of my sanctuary and dwelling and the locus of my eternal millennial and eternal theocratic kingdom, I chose Zion for the same reason I chose you, because you're the least and because Zion is a hill.
02:41 -  But it's a holy hill. In terms of the great mountains that God might have chosen that we would think in our humanity of eating off the wrong tree, that would be the logic of God's choice. Mount Olympus or the Geneva or United Nations in New York, no, God chooses a dung hill.
03:00 -  He chooses a cave to begin the whole Davidic kingdom. He chooses a stable to make his own point of entry into time and into history. Because this is God. He's revealed in his choices.
03:13 -  He has a preference for the least, for the weak, for the foolish, to confound the things that are supposedly or ostensibly wise and great. What you need to understand, and I wish that I had all kinds of time to develop it,
03:31 -  is that at the heart of the whole genius of the faith is a moral struggle between two opposing moral views, two wisdoms, two kingdoms, darkness and light, two intentions of prevailing over creation itself,
03:50 -  is the underlying struggle in the whole primeval history of creation to this present time. And Israel somehow is the pivot and the point of this struggle, particularly in the last days, because if the powers of darkness can destroy this people and destroy this entity
04:11 -  as one that can be located in time and place as ethnic and visible, it will have removed the ground for the realization of a kingdom that must be established through them and with them in the place and locus of God's choosing as I am.
04:24 -  You understand? That's why you're going to see the most vehement, bitter, ruthless, merciless, anti-Semitic crushing of this people in the last days, of which the Hitler time was almost just a kind of preview.
04:39 -  It was the powers of darkness who are really the ruling powers. The prince of this world comes, Jesus said. He acknowledges that he still has a kind of, though he's been defeated at the cross,
04:51 -  there's still a prevailing usurpation of it in a governmental way that affects nations and their conduct. And they don't want to give that up. They are usurping powers and love to jerk and to manipulate and every present day genocide,
05:07 -  whether it's Rwanda in Africa, whether it's Indonesia, wherever you look, cannot be explained except in terms of the underlying and invisible powers of darkness that prevail and want to establish their rule. Their ultimate end is chaos.
05:24 -  Their wisdom is destruction. They play upon force. And so God of necessity has to prevail and succeed by the very antithesis of another wisdom different than their own. That's why it says in the Psalms that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, God has perfected praise.
05:45 -  In order to stop the mouth of the enemy or the adversary, God has got not only to obtain a moral defeat that will be eternal, but he's got to obtain it on the moral ground of his own righteousness.
05:59 -  And therefore he avoids the use of force, violence, intimidation, threat, and plays upon weakness, humiliation, and the things that are the reflections of his own character and being. So Lord, send us on an excursion to understand that the issue of Israel
06:21 -  is not some affinity for that political state that presently exists and which is doomed, that must necessarily go into a destruction, into an expulsion, into a devastation, into a scattering, into an exile, and then also from the survivors and the remnant, the restoration and the return,
06:40 -  that will reveal both the judgment and the mercy of God. Lord, this is awesome. How do we approach it? It's a mystery where we come, my God, with hat and hands on tiptoe.
06:54 -  We don't want to be brash. And I'm just asking that you would select from the multitude of scriptures and prophetic things that which will give this people tonight a sense of this great drama,
07:07 -  which is the context of the church itself. There's no way that the church can understand itself, its activity, its call, except it sees itself in the context of this restoration that concludes history,
07:20 -  that brings in this long-standing historic stiff-necked and apostate people back again to their God and to their place in the garden, in the land that he has chosen, where they will then eat from the right tree and be to the nations all that he intends.
07:39 -  So this is a great drama, Lord, and the church is no accidental split off or some Johnny-come-lately phenomenon. It is birthed out of and called to and for the consummation of this mystery in the last days.
07:52 -  And who can begin to speak this? So grant us grace, Lord, by your Spirit, and single those things out now that would give us a precious framework of understanding
08:03 -  that will affect all our categories as it ought. And we thank you and give you praise. In Jesus' name, Amen. Well, I just quickly opened my Bible and was looking for something else,
08:17 -  and somehow I had a bookmark in Deuteronomy. Maybe you want to turn there. In the last statement of Moses before his own passing away,
08:34 -  it's called in chapter 32, the Song of Moses. And I don't know if it was literally sung, but I believe it was meant to be memorized. And maybe there was melody that went with it so that it could be sung from father to son
08:49 -  and through the generations, because it contains a warning of such an explicit kind of what would befall Israel's descendants in the latter days. And I can say as a Jew who grew up in a normative Jewish environment and culture,
09:04 -  which is to say non-religious, non-spiritual, though I was bar mitzvahed, I went to Hebrew school, knew nothing of this. The word God was not so much as mentioned.
09:13 -  We had no knowledge of Scripture as being divinely inspired. The prophets were some kind of strange thing that you chanted on the day of your bar mitzvah only to get the right intonation but without a knowledge of the content.
09:25 -  You can't believe how dark we are in our darkness. So don't be in any way intimidated by Jews that they have a supreme knowledge of Scripture and they'll make you look like the fool.
09:34 -  The fact of the matter is that any Sunday school kid that has the most elementary understanding of even the basic stories can far outwit the most celebrated and intellectual Jew. So had we known this, had my father sung this to me,
09:50 -  had I had a father who could sing, the fact that we can't sing and the fact that we don't have fathers, that we have a matriarchal mother, woman-dominated society,
09:59 -  is all of the perversion that comes to a people who have forfeited the Great Father. In the loss of him, we have lost everything, and it's amazing that despite all of that,
10:09 -  and not from pillar to post, and the Holocaust, which is not just the Nazi phenomenon, but the one that went down behind drawn shades and closed doors
10:18 -  in apartments in Brooklyn, New York, and Manhattan, and all of the places where Jews have been dispersed, it's been a Holocaust and attrition of broken lives and bodies
10:26 -  and varicose veins and nervous breakdowns and suicides, more than you can know for the want of the relationship with God that was his normative intention for us as a people.
10:38 -  So just to leap in, well, I think it's interesting to take a look at verse 8. I have not, in 36 years as a believer,
10:48 -  ever heard anyone ever make a comment or preach this publicly. But look at this, verse 8 of chapter 32. When the Most High apportioned donations,
10:58 -  when he divided humankind, mankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
11:07 -  Now, you may have something else in your margin. There are some optional readings. Some say the sons of God, some say the sons of Israel,
11:16 -  but more than I'm able to say, there's an angelic correlation in the heavenlies with the physical and visible manifestation in the earth.
11:27 -  There are sons of Israel, and there are also an angelic counsel in God that are relative to those sons.
11:35 -  But the point of the matter is this, that when God established the nations, he did so in recognition of Israel,
11:44 -  that from the very beginning in the concept of God, that Israel was to be the pivot and the center of his relationship with all nations.
11:53 -  And when you read the Psalms, you'll see how frequently the cry of the psalmist is against the nations.
11:59 -  Lord, how long are you going to suffer them? Show them that they're just men. How long are you going to tolerate their intransigence
12:05 -  and their arrogance, who will not bow to you as the God of all the earth and the God of all the creation, the maker of the nations?
12:11 -  The psalmist knew that their God was not some little ethnic and tribal deity. Their God was the creator and the God of all nations.
12:19 -  And the whole issue and struggle is bringing those nations under the dominion of God through the governmental structure that he has in his mind
12:30 -  whose center is Zion and whose people is Israel. If you can picture the twelve tribes of Israel, one tribe had the exclusive function
12:40 -  of being the priest to all the rest. That ratio of one tribe out of twelve had only a priestly function.
12:48 -  And so can you imagine that a nation in total would have a priestly function to all nations? That's God's design, and we had better recognize it,
12:59 -  because when the smoke clears and the last ravages are over and the millennial conditions prevail, that's what we're going to see.
13:06 -  The nations will come up to Jerusalem, literally. They will bring their goods and their blessings. They will bow before the feet of those
13:15 -  whom they formerly oppressed. It says the Gentiles of ten nations will clutch the skirt of a Jew and say,
13:21 -  take us to your God, for you know him. Really know him, because you have been through the mill. You have been sifted.
13:28 -  You have been refined at his hand in the most severe dealings that any people have ever received,
13:34 -  and yet also you have experienced his mercy and his restoration out of his own power. You know him supernaturally.
13:41 -  You know him in his judgment. You know him in his severity. You know him in his grace.
13:44 -  You know him in his mercy. You know him. It's not a Talmudic knowledge.
13:47 -  It's not a head knowledge. You know him in the most authentic way that the people can know him,
13:52 -  because in fact you are the first and only nation that has ever been raised from the dead. Dun, dun, dun, dun.
14:04 -  No kidding. The issue of God is the God who makes those things to be which are not.
14:10 -  It's the God who creates ex nihilo out of nothing. It's the God who raises the dead. And I want to say point blank,
14:19 -  there will never be a fulfillment of what God spoke to Abraham. And remember that God, as God,
14:24 -  his reputation, his name, and his honor depends on the fulfillment of his word, his promises, his covenants.
14:30 -  The issue of Israel is the issue of a God who can pay off and fulfill what he has long ago spoken,
14:38 -  despite every adverse condition to the contrary. Even Israel's unwillingness to be the chosen people, to be a nation that preaches the letter to the world.
14:46 -  When you talk to modern Israelis today, you know what they say? We want to be like every other nation.
14:51 -  We want to be the Hong Kong of the Middle East, and they're fast becoming that. And when they try to entice their Palestinian neighbors
14:59 -  to join in the prosperity that would be theirs if they laid aside their aggressive and violent intentions, they're not kidding.
15:06 -  They are going to be a center of Babylonian prosperity. And I mentioned already the class separations that are taking place and the mistreatment
15:14 -  and exploitation of foreign workers as well as Israelis themselves. So why did I bring that up?
15:23 -  Oh, I forgot what I was saying. This is a nation that in order to fulfill the promise of God to Abraham
15:33 -  that from your loins will come a people who will bless all the families out there. Not impress them, bless them.
15:39 -  See, we're very impressive in what we can do coming out of concentration camps with nothing but a tattooed number and a tatted shirt.
15:46 -  Give us ten years and we'll have a garage filled with cars and kids going to private schools while you're still struggling at minimum wages.
15:54 -  No wonder you're resentful and envious. But in that kind of success and the arrogance that it breeds, how can we bless anyone?
16:05 -  We're contemptuous, we're disdainful of the goyim. If you ever heard my mother spit that word out, you would shudder, the goyim.
16:12 -  She was as polite as she could be to that German visitor. Tell the story, you haven't told that to everybody. Oh, you haven't heard this?
16:19 -  I had one guest the other day and was seated at the dining table and I'm introducing them.
16:26 -  He's married to an American woman and I said, this is a brother who's from Germany, the living alcove.
16:32 -  Oh, my mother said, well, he can't help it. He was born there. The poor guy choked and spluttered.
16:40 -  If my mother wasn't 95, I think you would have punched her in the nose. She can't understand why I go to Germany.
16:46 -  She won't set her foot in a Volkswagen. Of course, she comes into my Mercedes Benz and says, I understand.
16:52 -  And that's where you learned your social skills, right? That's the end of the story. My mother tutored me.
16:58 -  So we're joking, but we need to understand God's design. That even the nations,
17:04 -  the number of the nations is relative to the sons of Israel. Not sons by mere ethnic
17:10 -  or genealogical birth, but sons also in the spiritual sense that we too are being called to sonship,
17:16 -  to rule, to authority, to dominion over God's creation, to sharing with him
17:22 -  the precious privilege of co-rulership because a son
17:28 -  has only one intent and passion is the glory of the Father. He never has an agenda for himself.
17:34 -  Can you imagine Israel coming to that place where it has no intention for itself per se as a people,
17:40 -  but to celebrate and to glorify its God and its Maker? That will be a historical fact when the smoke clears
17:46 -  at the end of the age, but it will take death and resurrection. And so Israel is on, of course,
17:54 -  with death now. We can see the state set. The enemies are glowering and in its frantic
18:00 -  defenselessness having to negotiate and having things continually blow up in its face,
18:06 -  and God has brought a predicament to Jews and to Israel of a kind that even Jewish intelligence
18:12 -  cannot solve. And we have had to come to that place. How did I come to that place?
18:18 -  I had to come to a place where my confidence in mind and wisdom and human goodness
18:24 -  was shown to be threadbare, vacuous without substance so that when I was apprehended by the Lord
18:30 -  in the first reading of the New Testament of the woman taken in the act of adultery, I'd never read that before, and my new Jewish hero
18:36 -  who was inspiring my heart that was better than Karl Marx and Freud and other Jewish heroes who have collapsed
18:42 -  was faced with the issue of this woman taken as, what do you say, Hatshot? You said you've come to fulfill the law not to destroy it.
18:48 -  This woman was taken right in the act. I said, what can he say? Judgment. There's no other alternative.
18:54 -  And my heart was pounding because I was an adulterer myself justifying it in the modern contemporary Jewish manner.
19:00 -  It was love. It was poetry. I don't know how we do it. But now I knew it was sin and that it deserved judgment.
19:06 -  And I was in the predicament with that woman. I was, you know, when you read the scriptures like that, it becomes another book.
19:12 -  And I'll tell you what, guys, the scriptures are going to become, like that for us, another book, where we have
19:18 -  only been reading as Bible study. That will be a nuts and bolts provision of God
19:24 -  for people living in extremity in the last days under persecution. And these letters will be written to us
19:30 -  with instruction and guidance. The issue of the Church of Eldership and government and the role of the Holy Spirit
19:36 -  will no longer be an idle matter of a Bible study. Then we go to what we were doing before. It will be our very sustenance.
19:42 -  It's what I've long waited for. That the conditions of our life will begin again to approximate
19:48 -  those to whom the scriptures were first given. And so we'll come full circle and the Church will
19:54 -  again be an oppressed island of sanity in a sea of hostility and
20:00 -  worldliness. So Israel is en route to its death
20:06 -  and it cannot extricate itself. So one of the provisions of the Oslo agreement
20:12 -  was a minimal police force for the Palestinians to maintain their own order. I believe that the number was
20:18 -  9,000. What they have in fact now is more like 50 to 75,000 of an army armed to the
20:24 -  teeth. These are not local policemen to maintain local order. This is a hostile army pointed at Israel's
20:30 -  throat and waiting its first opportunity. I can show you in scriptures that we could not have understood
20:36 -  until this present predicament historically was unfolded. That shows Israel not only as a defeated
20:42 -  nation but a humiliated nation. You can read it at your own leisure. Isaiah 50, 51
20:48 -  with a drink to the dregs, the cup of God's wrath. It's not some arbitrary thing that has befallen
20:54 -  them. It's not even just the malice of the nations that surround them. It's God's own judgment employing
21:00 -  those nations to bring Israel to a place of defeat and humiliation because there's
21:06 -  no going up without first going down. And we will resent God and have a
21:12 -  controversy with him over the severity of these dealings unless we understand what the end of them is.
21:18 -  A transformed nation brought back out of humiliation and death to a place of
21:24 -  honor and distinction before all nations throughout the millennial period and eternally. If we know
21:30 -  God's intention for this people because they are chosen. Not because they have a merit. It's not
21:36 -  because they're qualified in any way. In fact their lack of qualification has been our historic embarrassment.
21:42 -  God says, I'm not doing this for your sake because you have blasphemed my name
21:48 -  in every nation where I've driven you. I'm doing this for my sake. That my name which you have blasphemed
21:54 -  shall be honored. When the world and the nations will see my mercy. Because what is mercy if there's any
22:00 -  way in which it's deserved? Mercy is not mercy except that's undeserved. And what nation
22:06 -  is more qualified in this undeservingness than my own? See what I mean? And all of us when we think of it.
22:12 -  When we think of it and God's dealing with Israel will make us think of it. Because if you begin to
22:18 -  if you start to get irritated at God's singular selection
22:24 -  of Israel and something rises up in you almost inadvertently without, unconsciously, they don't deserve
22:30 -  it. Then what it's revealing is that though you have subscribed to the doctrine of grace, in effect
22:36 -  you have been living an Old Testament works and merit based
22:42 -  religion. And your response to Israel and God's mercy and grace and totally undeserved will bring
22:48 -  up from your deeps the truth of where in fact you are. Now this is part of the mystery.
22:54 -  That's why you can't understand the church independent of Israel. That Israel even in her apostasy and
23:00 -  backsliddenness and vileness performs a function for the church that is critical and
23:06 -  without which the church itself cannot come to its maturity, its sonship, its bridal character. There's a reciprocal
23:12 -  dealing and relationship. Oh I can show you scriptures. I wish I had all kinds of time. And I thought
23:18 -  in fact that the three speakings would be that time but the Lord had another thing though it's related.
23:24 -  For example in Psalm 102 God says the set time to favor
23:30 -  Zion has come. The deliverer will come out of Zion. And Paul quotes this in Romans 11
23:36 -  that when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, so all Israel shall be saved as it is written.
23:42 -  Can you see that if you negate Israel as a visible and ethnic entity, how then is there fulfillment?
23:48 -  See what I mean? There's got to be a people that are recognized that recognize themselves as being that
23:54 -  and that the world recognizes. Because it's God's dealing with that ethnic body that is the revelation of
24:00 -  himself both in judgment and in mercy. When the deliverer come, I will take transgression from Jacob.
24:08 -  Israel will be acted upon. They will be so inept, so incapable of anything in their own behalf
24:14 -  and must be reduced to that, that God might become all in all. They'll not know him as deliverer
24:20 -  and as savior and as redeemer and as healer unless they experience these powers
24:26 -  of God vested upon them in their total and inept hopelessness.
24:32 -  So we're going to see a nation so thoroughly reduced it will be incapable of affecting
24:38 -  anything that pertains to its own salvation. And when that salvation and deliverance comes, can you imagine the praise?
24:44 -  Well, you can read it in the Psalms. Some of the Psalms are eschatological as if they are written
24:50 -  after the event and they're celebrating the triumph of God's restoration and giving him eternal praise in the restored
24:56 -  Zion. It had to be written then, but it's for future use. And so
25:02 -  picture Israel celebrating this God that has brought it back out of dungeons and out of desperate places in darkness
25:08 -  because they will be cast to the farthest corners of the earth. The powers of darkness want to
25:14 -  either destroy them or to keep them as far from Zion as they can be kept because their restoration
25:20 -  will be the end of the false, usurping powers of the air. Because the
25:26 -  Lord himself is, says in Acts 321, is contained in the heavens. He has imposed upon
25:32 -  himself a restraint out of his own wisdom and faith until all
25:38 -  that has been spoken by the prophets of restoration will be fulfilled. Read Acts 321.
25:44 -  And the church in its typical usurping misappropriating
25:50 -  arrogance has taken a literal statement about Israel and turned to take it to itself.
25:58 -  The prophet spoke nothing about a restoration of the church, for God knows one is needed and will not come
26:04 -  until the church will humble itself and receive the centrality of Israel in the plan of God
26:10 -  and bless the Lord for it and agree with it out of their hearts.
26:16 -  Israel represents the last bastions of want
26:22 -  of surrender on the part of the church. It measures that, though it doesn't know it.
26:28 -  When it says they don't deserve it, it's really saying something about a lack of an appropriation of the grace of God for
26:34 -  itself. It's not unlike the prodigal son and the older brother. Remember that the father
26:40 -  ran to greet the son so grateful for his return and he did not withhold from him letting him go and
26:46 -  being reduced by his own misuse of his freedom until the time he was eating the
26:52 -  scruff with the pigs. And he says my father's servants do better than this. I'll go back if he'll have me. Well the father
26:58 -  had him. He ran to greet him with a robe, with a ring, with a kiss and with a feast. But the older brother was
27:04 -  what's the word? Outside and refused to come in. Look at the depth of this obstinacy
27:10 -  and powdered and you never did this for me and you're doing it for him. And he squandered his substance
27:16 -  and the father said but don't you know that all that I have has always been yours?
27:22 -  Evidently he didn't know and we don't know it either because if we knew it we would have a
27:28 -  largesse of soul and a magnanimity full of grace to welcome back this prodigal son without any thought
27:34 -  that it would mean for us a loss of our privileged place with the father. Excuse me? Listen, I'm a
27:40 -  Jewish believer. Can you understand I resented and resisted this revelation? I was so centered in the
27:46 -  church that I looked upon the restoration of Israel as somehow threatening the church and its glory
27:52 -  because unto him be glory in the church. So who are these upstarts coming back out of a history of apostasy
27:58 -  to become central? But the Lord showed me, hey, cool it. There's plenty of glory both for
28:04 -  my church and for my nation. The fact of the matter is that they have reciprocal and similar
28:10 -  but uniquely different rewards. The restored Israel does not receive a glorified body. It receives an extension
28:18 -  of natural life where if a child dies at an infant at the age of a hundred it's considered an abnormality
28:24 -  and much blessing on the land that it's increased but the church is glorified.
28:30 -  Literally glorified. We are raised up. We are given bodies of a kind that fit us for our
28:36 -  millennial and eternal destiny which is to ascend and descend upon the son of man. Remember what Jesus said
28:42 -  to Nathaniel? I saw you standing under the tree. I saw you mourning and lamenting
28:48 -  the loss of Israel's dignity and call and the seeming hopelessness of the situation the way some of us often
28:54 -  feel about the church. Oh, thou art the Christ, thou art the son of God. You are the king. You saw that?
29:00 -  You must be the holy one, the awaited one. And I'll show you something greater. He should have said I'll show you
29:06 -  the greatest angels ascending and descending upon the son of man. He was making an illusion
29:12 -  to the same thing that Jacob saw in his dream. That is the consummation of the age.
29:18 -  A people who are in a transcendent condition where they can move through the dimensions that are both earthly
29:24 -  and heavenly in their governmental function. Remember how aggravated Paul was
29:30 -  when he saw two Corinthians going to the court of law to settle a dispute between them? Going to a civil court? He said, what are you guys
29:36 -  up to? What are you doing? You're going to the court of law to resolve a difference between you? Let the least
29:42 -  of those in the church handle that dispute. Don't you know, he said, you're going to rule over angels? Don't you know you're going
29:48 -  to rule over nations? They didn't know. And we don't know. So we have a millennial and eternal
29:54 -  destiny in keeping with the theocratic rule of God established with Israel's restoration and the Lord's
30:00 -  return, which is the fulfillment of all that the prophets have spoken. We need not be jealous. In fact, it'll be
30:06 -  in compliance with and in accord with Israel's earthly place and we in our heavenly
30:12 -  place. Everyone says, when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, so all Israel shall be saved. What is the
30:18 -  fullness of the Gentiles? A people for his name from among all nations and evidently a certain number
30:24 -  that can be fulfilled. And I don't say this as thus sayeth the Lord, but as an opinion
30:30 -  that the number is specific and relates to the vacancies
30:36 -  in the heavenly places where the usurping and fallen angels had continued in their gifting call,
30:42 -  which is irrevocable, but had misused it to become the Gods of this present world and to turn
30:48 -  the allegiance of men away from God into themselves. You can't understand Nazism or
30:54 -  mass tribal genocide in Africa or any of the other things without understanding the
31:00 -  place of these powers as they affect nations. But they are going to be cast out of the heavens. Who then replaces
31:06 -  them? Who's qualified to rule? That's why Paul said some rule over five cities
31:12 -  and some over ten. On what basis? On the basis of your overcoming life
31:18 -  in this world and in the context of last days persecution
31:24 -  where our reward is not just a cloud with a harp. I mean maybe you like that.
31:34 -  But actual participation in the government of God from the heavenly place while Israel is operating from the earthly
31:40 -  place. And for the first time at the end of history and at the commencement, what makes the millennium the millennium?
31:46 -  An agreement between heaven and earth from the earth to restore Israel in concert with God and
31:52 -  his purposes as sons who have no purpose for themselves but to glorify the father and to bring the benevolent rule of
31:58 -  God to the nations and the wisdom of God. When we talk about government in the biblical sense, we're not talking about bureaucracy,
32:04 -  shuffling papers or self-aggrandizement. We're talking about making known the essential wisdom of God on
32:10 -  how to live, how to be merciful, how to be wise in the depths and intricacies
32:16 -  of relationships and conflict. We can bring that to nations. How? Because we've learned those lessons in the
32:22 -  church. Our church was not just a succession of Sunday services. It was meeting real issues head on, face to
32:28 -  face and looking eyeball to eyeball and dealing and learning through those experiences. We didn't shun it.
32:34 -  It's our school. And we'll graduate and have rulership with him in proportion to the expertise,
32:40 -  the knowledge and the humility that has been gained in this life because we cannot rule except we rule
32:46 -  in the spirit of the lamb himself. You see what I mean? And that's why Israel itself as a nation has got to be
32:52 -  broken because now it is so arrogant. But it's brokenness that has to do with servanthood.
32:58 -  And that's why Israel itself must walk the road to Calvary of its servant lord before them.
33:04 -  The same kind of thing. They'll pass to the nations. There'll be no beauty that any will desire and there'll be more than
33:10 -  any man. When you read Isaiah 53, you come to a place in the chapter where the text shifts
33:16 -  and it's no more the prophet narrative describing someone broken but it's the nation itself speaking.
33:22 -  Oh, he was wounded for our transgressions. Oh, with his stripes we are healed.
33:28 -  Oh, now we understand that he was stricken by God and spitten and we thought that what makes them
33:34 -  change, what makes them see what they had not seen till now and must see, to understand their Messiah and his
33:40 -  suffering in relationship to his servanthood. It's their own suffering. It's their own road to Calvary.
33:46 -  It's their own rejection. It's their own being despised. And that ties in with Matthew 25
33:52 -  where the issue of judgment for the nations is one thing only that separates the sheep from the goats.
34:02 -  What did you do for the least of these, my brethren? So I know that I know that I know
34:10 -  that there's a coming time where a nation shall be brought into humiliation and death
34:16 -  first in Israel itself which we could not possess because the possession of the
34:22 -  land is relative to the relationship with the Lord and our ability to keep his covenant. We'll not
34:28 -  have the land except as gift, except as inheritance, except on the basis of a covenant-keeping
34:34 -  ability that God will give us when he makes for us a new covenant of an everlasting kind which you
34:40 -  as believers have already received. And that covenant will never be broken. It's everlasting. How come?
34:46 -  Because it has nothing to do with our Jewish ability of covenant-keeping. Here's what makes it new. Not its content
34:52 -  but its fulfillment. I will write my law in your hearts. I will
34:58 -  be your God. You will know me. It will no longer be one teaching another. You will all know me from the least to the greatest.
35:04 -  And so that's the desired conclusion when Israel is brought first through
35:10 -  terrible devastation and sifting that is appropriate to its call and destiny.
35:16 -  You can't be a servant. What does it mean a servant? It's not some officious
35:22 -  guy throwing his weight around who has the credentials and you better heed me or else because I'm Jewish, I'm Israel.
35:28 -  It's someone broken, grateful even to be able to breathe who by every reckoning deserves
35:34 -  eternal obliteration and somehow has not only been saved and delivered and whose national identity is still preserved
35:40 -  but is called to the honorific place of serving the Most High God as priest
35:46 -  with him that can come under the people that they're going to serve. So can you imagine
35:52 -  Jews bringing the Gospel to Jordan, to to Iran, Iraq, to their present
35:58 -  enemies, to Palestinians, to those now where a good Arab is a dead Arab and bringing it
36:04 -  with compassion, with mercy, with love. That will take the profoundest brokenness that any nation has ever experienced
36:10 -  and in fact the repentance that comes to Israel in
36:16 -  Zechariah 12 when we shall see him whom we have pierced. Picture an expulsion of a nation, some residue remaining behind
36:22 -  which has always been the case in every expulsion but then a return of some residue of those that have been
36:28 -  cast out for the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion implying that they were there before but not as
36:34 -  the redeemed and they come having passed through an experience of brokenness and the revelation of the Lord and the
36:40 -  mercy given through the Church who recognize them as the least of these, his brethren. The Lord speaks of them as
36:46 -  his brethren before they're even saved before sees the relationship
36:52 -  and he's identified with them even in their pre-conversion condition, even in their judgment
36:58 -  he's one with them. And when the Church will be identified with them in the same way as he, we
37:04 -  will have arrived. And that's why in Psalm 1 or 2, when does the set time to favor Zion come?
37:10 -  He says, when my servants he's speaking about us now, not Israel when my servants shall have pity
37:16 -  on her dust and compassion on her stones. Imagine
37:22 -  how shall I say this? I want to be sweet-spirited and nice
37:28 -  but I have to say that in all my experience in traveling the world and bearing this message I was sharing with someone today
37:34 -  nowhere have I been more rudely treated and rejected scornfully than in Great Britain.
37:40 -  I don't know what it is. There's something about Anglo-Saxons, the British or I pick it up in New Zealand
37:46 -  or Australia and places like that, but Great Britain itself. The severest resistance to this word about Israel. I can't tell you
37:52 -  how rudely I've been treated. So can you imagine a Church of this national
37:58 -  and ethnic background that sees itself in vying with and competition with and even superior to
38:04 -  and even has taken for itself Israel's destiny having to acknowledge no, that there is
38:10 -  a place that God has designated for this ethnic people that I must not usurp but come
38:16 -  alongside and participate in their recovery and in their restoration and even have compassion on their stones
38:22 -  and pity on their dust. That doesn't mean a new affinity for Israel's archeology. It means
38:28 -  a sympathy and a compassion for Israel's judgment for the stones in the dust of which Psalm 102
38:34 -  speaks is Haifa, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and every modern city of
38:40 -  Israel because the prophets tell us consistently their cities will be left as ruins and in rubbles. The land
38:46 -  will be made desolate. It will be without an inhabitant and even Israel cries out the land has become
38:52 -  our destruction. It's going to be reduced to rubble and most of the world will gloat over this and rub their
38:58 -  hands in glee. I don't know what it is. This gentile satisfaction at Israel's humiliation.
39:04 -  They had it coming. Look at them. They did this. They did that.
39:10 -  That will be the prevailing attitude of the unregenerate in the world. But my servants
39:16 -  will have pity on her dust and compassion on her stones. It's more than even a sentimental. It's an identification
39:22 -  of being standing with Israel in the shame of its judgment because they're for the grace of God go
39:28 -  we. We are essentially of the same stuff. We ourselves have failed and what have we but what
39:34 -  God has given and what is our salvation but his grace. They don't merit it. They don't merit it.
39:40 -  But we can identify with them and says when I see that
39:46 -  the set time to favor Zion has come. Then I will come out of Zion and be her deliverer. It's
39:52 -  as if the issue is not Israel but the church. God is waiting for something in the church
39:58 -  that by instinct, by tradition, by history, being essentially gentile has usurped
40:04 -  or overridden the literal statements of Israel's restoration
40:10 -  and its nationality and its whole gentilic makeup. There's an enmity and animosity
40:16 -  against the Jew. I can't tell you I'm like a man between two worlds. I've been in
40:22 -  the Lubavitcher Hasidic communities. I see them with their beards. I've been in their synagogues and I know that everything
40:28 -  about them is calculated to irritate and rub raw those who come from another
40:34 -  kind of culture. I'm seeing this acted out in my own home. I have a wife who is the gentile of the gentiles,
40:40 -  Danish. And I believe that from her pagan
40:46 -  Gods going all the way back, it's a covenant rejecting Israel, Hebrew despising
40:54 -  people. And so she has to feed my mother every day. And her
41:00 -  Danish dishes are full of cream with meat, with sauces, with gravy, where my mother would puke.
41:06 -  So now she has to rigidly separate meat from milk.
41:12 -  And it's irritating her to death. And how many dishes can she think of the way she has to cook for my mother in a special way? Why does she need
41:18 -  a special, why can't she eat like everybody else? She's 95 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I'm seeing this friction.
41:24 -  What my mother is in and of herself by her nature so rubs raw what my wife
41:30 -  is by her nature. And that's the underlying tension of the ages. And that's the mystery
41:36 -  of God. That he can take the Jew and the gentile that had been historically separated and had
41:42 -  enmity one with the other and make of them one new man, one people.
41:48 -  It's the everlasting praise of his glory. And the church is the place
41:54 -  where it has its first fulfillment. See what a struggle it is for us.
42:02 -  So when we will have compassion on her stones and pity on her dust is the thing that God waits for,
42:08 -  then he turns and delivers Israel himself.
42:14 -  So the issue is the church. And we're going to face that test.
42:20 -  And even our eternal destiny will be affected because those who did not recognize in the least of these
42:26 -  his people the brethren of the Lord and did not extend mercy that they might have obtained it and survived by it
42:32 -  will find themselves cast into the lake of fire prepared for the devil and for his angels. I mean it's, I myself
42:38 -  gasp. I want to cry out and say Lord, in my human mind, disputing with the judge, isn't that too
42:44 -  severe an eternal judgment for the failure of one thing? But the issue is that the failure
42:50 -  of that one thing is the failure of everything. More than you can understand. The issue of the Jew,
42:56 -  the issue of Israel for the church, is the issue of everything. It's your attitude toward God. It's your relationship with God.
43:02 -  It's the knowledge of God, his heart and his spirit, and with yourselves and in so many things, if there's something residual,
43:08 -  something unresolved, something that is still based on merit and human
43:14 -  ability that is rather than the surrender to God's grace, this issue
43:20 -  of the Jew will reveal it. So I say to the church, don't measure your relationship by the
43:26 -  euphoric feeling that you can yourself engender by your own worship. I was telling Bob
43:32 -  in the car the other day, I'll tell you how foolish Ben Israel is as a community, we covenanted with God, Lord,
43:38 -  don't let our worship exceed the truth of our relationships. Don't give us
43:44 -  a false sense of reality that somehow we have it all together, and look how spiritual we are because we're experiencing the euphoric effects
43:50 -  of our own worship, but keep it related to where we in fact are with each other and with you.
43:56 -  I said if you walked in, you'd put your fingers in both ears. It was discordant, it was out of... Concerned in Romans 11,
44:04 -  I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery, brethren, lest you become wise in your own conceit.
44:10 -  I can't tell you how fateful a warning that was, and how much it has been in fact described
44:16 -  to church of our own generation that has become conceited, inflated, pompous, presuming,
44:22 -  self-aggrandizing in all of its programs, and the kingdom now, and so on,
44:28 -  is all to be traced back to the absence of this mystery. There's something salutary,
44:34 -  there's something efficacious in the understanding of the mystery that brings to the church
44:40 -  a temper and a balance that makes the church the church. If this is omitted from our consideration,
44:46 -  and I'm not talking about technically, and certainly not sentimentally, I'm not talking about running to Israel
44:52 -  to plant a tree, or however blessed that might be, I'm talking about a spiritual appropriation of the mystery
44:58 -  of the kind that I'm trying to set forth tonight is God's intention for our sanity, for our balance,
45:04 -  lest we would, in our usurping posture, take to ourselves what God never intended. What was the problem
45:10 -  with Adam and Eve? They took to themselves what God never intended. They exceeded the parameters of God's wisdom
45:16 -  for them, and in that they brought their own destruction and expulsion, and we're in danger of the same thing
45:22 -  by not allowing ourselves to be restricted to what God has intended for us, but when we
45:28 -  take on Israel's destiny as being our own and have no place for it, we are exceeding what God has
45:34 -  chosen and what God has prescribed. It defeats us as a church and is an obstruction to the fulfillment
45:40 -  of what can come to them only through the church. God is going to reduce Israel in such a way
45:46 -  that unless something comes to it from outside itself, it will not survive, and that something must
45:52 -  come from us, and that's why I can go in every nation. My brother asked me, what are you doing in Zimbabwe,
45:58 -  his own place of birth and upbringing? I bring the message there that I bring to Singapore
46:04 -  and Japan and wherever I am. Even Egypt, I'm telling them
46:10 -  with a complete confidence, you're not exempt from the obligation to be to Israel what God will require
46:16 -  from all nations and the church of all nations, because I'm telling you that the day will come when
46:22 -  you will find expelled again into your nation Israelis. Because God said, I will
46:32 -  scatter you to the farthest corners of the Earth and beyond the river Cush. And I can tell
46:38 -  South Africans, be prepared for the sudden devastation that will come to Jews worldwide
46:44 -  in the time of Jacob's trouble, that will uproot them out of Cape Town and Pretoria and Johannesburg
46:50 -  and find themselves flushed out suddenly with nothing more than they can take on their own backs and cast
46:56 -  out onto the roads and byways. And they'll not survive unless there's a church that anticipates this
47:02 -  and has already set in motion a way to receive them and to move them on in a clandestine manner that they would
47:08 -  not be detected of the kind that we saw in embryo through saints in World War II, like
47:14 -  the hiding place in Holland where I have been, actually in the wall in Cory Ten Boom's bedroom
47:20 -  of a false wall that they opened up where you can come in and it's a suffocating thing and
47:26 -  there were seven adult Jews in that wall while the Nazis were outside pulling up the floorboards and trying
47:32 -  to find the hiding place because someone had ratted on her on that family and they could not find them and these Jews had to hold
47:38 -  their breath. Imagine the humiliation of having to pass around a little can for the urine
47:44 -  and to do it quietly you can't sneeze, choke or splutter but it'll be your death. A Dutch brother
47:50 -  in one of my messages in the States living there now, he said I lived through that time, you know that many
47:56 -  of my Dutch people died because they took Jews in but Jews were not used to the confinement
48:02 -  they couldn't stand the tension and they broke loose and ran for it and of course were caught and under interrogation
48:08 -  they revealed where it was that they were being hidden and so those who had taken them in perished.
48:14 -  That's going to be the challenge before us, the prospect of an almost inevitable
48:20 -  martyrdom, of the giving up of our life more than our convenience because if they're going to be in flight worldwide, if they have
48:26 -  to leave South Africa, if they have to find a place of refuge in North America, if we ourselves have
48:32 -  been in Northern Minnesota for 25 years having received a supernatural call to establish a place of refuge
48:38 -  in Minnesota to receive Jews coming out of Canada, where then can they and will they be safe?
48:44 -  The time of Jacob's trouble is global and I was going to take you into the book of Amos where it says in chapter 9
48:50 -  I will sift you through all nations and as one sifts corn in a
48:56 -  sieve and not so much as a kernel will fall to the ground. Those that transgress against me, the rebels
49:02 -  will say, this shall not come upon me. I'll bring them out of the lands where they have sojourned but I'll not bring them into the land.
49:08 -  This is the two thirds that I estimate of Jews that will not survive this process but the redeemed
49:14 -  of the Lord, the remnant will survive it and return to Zion
49:20 -  with everlasting joy upon their heads. Why everlasting? Because this is the last time
49:26 -  of their national affliction. There's not going to be another Holocaust. This is the final one.
49:32 -  And they survive it because of the mercy that has been extended by Gentiles, believers, who have
49:38 -  obtained mercy, that they may extend mercy. And so I say to the Church, are you able to extend
49:44 -  mercy? Or do you only know it technically and phraseologically
49:50 -  rather than authentically and existentially? Listen, we're middle class saints. We live
49:56 -  comfortably and well. We're enjoying much benefit. Where, in fact, do we know the mercy of God? Where have
50:02 -  we had to know the mercy of God that we can extend mercy? But if we have not had to know it until now,
50:08 -  the commitment to God's program of Israel's last days attrition will
50:14 -  require that knowledge. How do I know mercy? Because I'm experiencing it right now. As I have experienced it this morning
50:20 -  and Friday. Why? Because I'm always thrust into life and death situations. You guys
50:26 -  may have thought it was a meeting or a message that could afford to fail. For me, it was a life and death thing of eternal
50:32 -  moment. And so I experience the mercy of the deliverance of the Word.
50:40 -  Like tonight. There's not one of us that can estimate what tonight means. I keep looking
50:46 -  at my brother here. I get a Holy Ghost chill even as I'm saying that. That there's a significance
50:52 -  in your participation in this mystery. Maybe because of your African origins or your place of
50:58 -  eminence in the business world or Ellison himself who is a Jew who is the head of your organization. I don't know what it is.
51:04 -  That maybe even your basement will one day not house believers but Jews who
51:10 -  have to be abruptly taken in and then move quickly from this place to another. I don't know why. But we've come to a place
51:16 -  and you have to believe, as I'm not speaking these things because I'm Jewish, but I'm speaking
51:22 -  them because of an office and a call that that we're coming to a place
51:32 -  of such an urgency that I even shrink from the melodramatic character of
51:38 -  it. I want to flee from it myself. But how can I flee when I'm living in the place in northern Minnesota
51:44 -  eight miles from the closest town in the boondocks where I left a 17-room house in New Jersey
51:50 -  with nine bedrooms and five baths and two volvos and gave up that whole lifestyle because there's a God who rescued me
51:56 -  when I was a speaker in northern Minnesota and they said there's a property for sale. Would you care to see it? I said why not?
52:02 -  It's nice to look at the countryside. They drove me up to this bankrupt boys camp with a chain across the road
52:08 -  and I got out of the car and I stepped over the chain. When my foot came down on the property the Lord said dominion,
52:14 -  the name that the camp is born now for it was sent free. End time teaching center, community,
52:20 -  refuge. I never knew what the refuge part meant. I put it up on the shelf until
52:26 -  as I mentioned this morning the Lord ended our community and sent me out in that
52:32 -  season of death to go to a Lutheran seminary and if I could take all times to show how God confirmed that
52:38 -  and then began to reveal in that season of death this mystery that it took a 14-month sabbatical silence
52:44 -  before the Lord would ever allow me a first speaking on a subject so sacred. If it's that holy, that sacred,
52:50 -  requiring that kind of revelation of a mystery out of death, what will it require for the Church for its
52:56 -  fulfillment? And that every time that I speak this there are no two times the same as you can compare
53:02 -  the first time that we met and I shared. I'm not in control of this. This is not out of my mind.
53:08 -  I gasp, how will you take us in what direction? So, somehow the issue
53:14 -  of death and resurrection is central to the whole economy
53:20 -  of God and I'm being opposed by Jewish believers, by Messianic congregations, I'm persona non grata
53:26 -  in Israel, I'm an offense and a stink in many places because of the Holocaust book and in
53:32 -  defense of myself in the newsletter there's an article on true and false prophets in which I say I'm
53:38 -  being brought now to a place where I have to raise the issue for those that are hearing me, are they merely listening
53:44 -  to a human opinion? If so, they can discard it. Are they merely listening to a man who's
53:50 -  had some kind of revelation of a subjective kind? Well, then that can be discarded. But are
53:56 -  they listening to a man who is speaking out of an office given of God as prophet to interpret the prophetic
54:02 -  scriptures itself and to unveil the pattern of God in the last days that requires a devastating judgment
54:08 -  before a glorious return? Mourning and sighing will flee away and everlasting joy
54:14 -  shall be upon their heads. So in the co-joining of mourning and sighing is the statement of everlasting
54:20 -  joy. But the mourning and sighing cannot be understood except as I prophetically interpreted
54:26 -  on the basis of an office given as being the mourning that is not explicable except
54:32 -  that you see it as the loss of the nation state. You can't understand what Israel,
54:38 -  present Israel, has meant for Jews, their own homeland at last. We don't have to be at the mercy
54:44 -  of the Goyim. We have our own nation. We have a place of safety. And ironically what has become has become our greatest
54:50 -  threat. And that's why I'm opposed now to Jews going to Israel. To go there now is to run into the vortex
54:56 -  of violence and make your death almost inevitable. Later on it will be millennially a place of abounding
55:02 -  peace and blessing. Now it's going to be a crucible of devastation, judgment, and violence.
55:10 -  So I'm raising the question what's your obligation to what I'm sharing? Can you dismiss it as a man's opinion?
55:16 -  And because there are other matters saying, no, present Israel is the prophetic fulfillment. Yes, they're going through a hard
55:22 -  time now, but they'll adjust and they'll overcome. There may be a time of Jacob's trouble, but not like you, what you say, Art, that there's
55:28 -  going to be an expulsion and exile be cast into the nations. They've done that already. This is permanent because God
55:34 -  said in Jeremiah 26 that you'll always remain before me as a nation because I made my covenant with the moon and with the
55:40 -  stars. It's rooted in creation itself. So how can you say that this nation is going
55:46 -  to be destroyed and the people be cast out again? Because God is not under obligation to preserve a state,
55:52 -  especially a state that has been birthed out of human, Zionist, socialistic,
55:58 -  and atheistic endeavor. He's allowed it in order for them to see the
56:04 -  difference between the Jacob grasping of something and that which will be subsequently given to them
56:10 -  as an inheritance when they receive a new heart and a new spirit and an everlasting covenant
56:16 -  and are planted in the land. They have to see the one in order to eternally appreciate the other.
56:22 -  But our mistake as eager Christians operating out of our own minds, oh no, this is it.
56:28 -  You're talking, no, it can't happen. Don't tell me what can't happen and what God will not
56:34 -  do. Do you feel that the coming together of the natural state of Israel as it is right now
56:40 -  is a fulfillment of prophecy and preparation for the nations to gather against it? Yeah, absolutely.
56:46 -  Because in the time of Jacob's trouble is spoken by Jesus himself in Matthew 24 and
56:52 -  Luke 21. And my opponents say the time of Jacob's trouble is past.
56:58 -  It's the Nazi time. Well, then how do you explain that Jesus said there's a time coming of a trouble
57:04 -  greater than any that this nation has ever known in its history or will ever again know, and if that time
57:10 -  were not cut short, no flesh would survive. But for the elect's sake, the remnant, it will be cut short.
57:16 -  How can you say that that was the Nazi Holocaust when Jesus says, when you see these signs, you who are in Jerusalem
57:22 -  flee to the mountains of Judea. I pray that it doesn't come on the winter. It doesn't come on the Shabbat. Why?
57:28 -  Because on the Shabbat, everything ceases. You can't get a bus, probably no movement. So it's clear that the origin
57:34 -  of this time that will affect Jews worldwide has its inception in the nation itself and in
57:40 -  Jerusalem. So of necessity, there had to be a preliminary of return. But that preliminary
57:46 -  is not the fulfillment. It only provides the platform in which the drama is further enacted to the point
57:52 -  where there's an abomination of desolation spoken in Daniel. That is the sign when you see this
57:58 -  flee, because that's the beginning of this inveterate hatred that's going to be poured out upon all Jews beginning at
58:04 -  Jerusalem. So to misinterpret that as being the fulfillment, God's
58:10 -  not under obligation to preserve the state, but the nation will never expire before him. His word says so.
58:16 -  He's rooted it in creation itself. And we need to distinguish between the political entity of a state, largely the result
58:22 -  of human attention and ability, prowess, Jewish ability and finance, as against
58:28 -  the everlasting entity that will distinguish this people and glorify God, which is the redeemed
58:34 -  nation, both on the same land. Okay.
58:44 -  Do you see the miraculous, though, even in the coming together of a nation that's been
58:50 -  dispelled for 2,000 years? God's providence is undoubtedly in it, and that he's preserved
58:56 -  them in their past wars because the time was not yet for their destruction and the whole issue
59:02 -  of the tension now between Palestinians and Arab nations had to be brought to its final pitch that only an
59:08 -  Antichrist figure of world renown and recognition could solve. We're waiting for the appearance of
59:14 -  that figure. We don't know when this treaty is concluded. It's a secret. It may not even be revealed publicly,
59:20 -  but we'll know that the time has come, the seventh week in the middle of it, when this
59:26 -  covenant that has been made will be broken. It's a covenant with death when the one who has authenticated
59:32 -  it by his own anointing and world recognition seeks now to obtain from Jews
59:38 -  the recognition of himself as God. And Jews will recognize, my God, that we've fallen this far.
59:46 -  We rejected the son of God, and Jesus said, you reject me, but others will come, and then
59:52 -  you'll receive. My covenant, my new covenant you have refused, their covenant you'll make. You'll make it with
59:58 -  the devil himself, because your back is to the wall and the issue of your own survival, the preservation of your own state
01:00:04 -  compels you to negotiate because the technology of our age is such that there is no
01:00:10 -  defense. You cannot defend against vessels that take only moments or minutes to come from any neighboring nation
01:00:16 -  full of germs, gas, and that stuff. Only negotiation.
01:00:22 -  But who's going to validate these negotiations? What figure? Is it a pope or someone of that kind of eminence? History
01:00:28 -  will soon enough reveal, and when we see that then we can expect this explosion when Jews
01:00:34 -  refuse the acknowledgement of this figure in his claim for deity and realize the error
01:00:40 -  of their ways, and then will suffer the fury of his retaliation, and it will affect
01:00:46 -  Jews worldwide. So then, how are the redeemed of the Lord to return to
01:00:54 -  Zion when they are sifted through the nations? And why is the sifting
01:01:00 -  required? Because in Ezekiel 20 it says, I will sift you through the wilderness of the nations, and I will meet
01:01:06 -  with you face to face in the wilderness of the nations. There's something about wilderness.
01:01:12 -  There's something about stripping. Maybe even the film The Gladiator, a man of eminent rank as general,
01:01:18 -  had himself to be so reduced in the nations where he was cast out. I'm just thinking of the application
01:01:24 -  and made a slave and comes back to the principal capital
01:01:30 -  in the guise of gladiator. It's something of playing upon the same theme.
01:01:36 -  That's right. Could you give us the reference for the Jews meeting in the wilderness
01:01:42 -  of the Lord? Ezekiel 20 from verse 33
01:01:48 -  on, we can take a look at it. There's a clear pattern in the prophetic scriptures
01:01:56 -  of a last days expulsion and a sifting through all nations. And it's the basis,
01:02:02 -  as I've already said, of the judgment of Lord Jesus now seated with Israel's restoration. And what is his first judgment?
01:02:08 -  To separate the sheep from the goats one by one, one question only. What did you do for the least of these,
01:02:14 -  my brethren? And they say, when did we see you, Lord? The Lord terminology indicates a certain
01:02:20 -  kind of Christian identification but not sufficiently spiritual to have recognized that
01:02:26 -  in this despised and rejected people who had no comeliness that we should desire them
01:02:32 -  are the people of God. And not enough of an identification for their stones and for their dust
01:02:38 -  or for themselves that we should extend to them mercy to take them in because when did we see you naked,
01:02:44 -  thirsty, hungry, sick and in prison? They're going to be in all of those conditions
01:02:50 -  including Steven Spielberg, the biggest hot shots, Gerald Levin of Time Warner Corporation
01:02:56 -  and all of the men that are riding high in the multi-billion dollar astronomical realm of success
01:03:02 -  will be utterly reduced and stripped and thrust into environments
01:03:08 -  with which they are totally unfamiliar in the fearful panic and terror of being in some place
01:03:14 -  in which you have no control over your destiny or fate or your survival. You're cast upon others and ultimately
01:03:20 -  the Lord Himself. Isaiah 35 is another beautiful text. The wilderness will be glad for them.
01:03:26 -  Can you imagine? Dumb and insane nature will rejoice when it sees Jews tramping through
01:03:32 -  in their broken and despicable condition because they know better than we that this is already a sign at the end
01:03:38 -  that the torment in which creation itself is bound with a curse is soon to be
01:03:44 -  relieved with the restoration of this people. What about Messianic Jews? Who are they?
01:03:52 -  More than that. Well, they'll have a special obligation
01:03:58 -  with their own people, particularly those in Israel. It's interesting. I go off on so many tangents
01:04:04 -  that when I share there our last conference there wasn't the Messianic Fellowship
01:04:10 -  that would receive me. There was not a platform for the word. We had to have the conference in our own hotel
01:04:16 -  and every night be given a larger room because the title of the conference was The Coming Calamity of Israel.
01:04:22 -  I went to announce that it must be heard, it must be considered lest when it comes it would take them by surprise.
01:04:28 -  But you know what these men these friends tell me? They don't consider me a friend any longer.
01:04:34 -  Art, if what you're saying is true what about our ministry? How can it be true?
01:04:40 -  You know, devastation is coming. What about my ministry? And one ministry
01:04:46 -  in the most recent mailing made it quite clear they just bought an immense multi-million dollar facility in Tel Aviv
01:04:52 -  as a center of worship, praise and prayers and so on that gives every indication
01:04:58 -  that they don't think that a devastation is coming but rather that Israel's restoration is going to come through a one by one
01:05:04 -  salvation, largely the result of their own ministries. Because there are Jews being saved in Israel.
01:05:10 -  There are congregations growing up and they are Jewish believers in the church
01:05:16 -  but their destiny will not be with the nation but with the church. They will receive glorified bodies. My destiny is not with the nation.
01:05:22 -  My destiny is with the church. I'll rise with the church. So what they don't know is
01:05:28 -  that their real ministry has yet to be obtained, namely to anticipate the coming calamity
01:05:34 -  in Israel, the vortex of that violence and are ready to anticipate and prepare an outlet by which some Jews
01:05:40 -  will be totally panic stricken and overwhelmed might be brought to a place of safety and refuge. And that will be our challenge
01:05:46 -  in the places where we are in the world. At what time do you see the Pose of Selah, the promised land
01:05:52 -  to be belonging to the Jewish people?
01:05:58 -  It's at the climax of their consummation when they are returned, the redeemed
01:06:04 -  of the Lord are returned to Zion. And the first thing that we see in the prophets is the rebuilding
01:06:10 -  of the cities that have been laid waste left in ruins and made desolate. So it indicates that there's a
01:06:16 -  massive dislocation brought through the violence that has brought destruction to their cities and that the first
01:06:22 -  thing upon their return is the rebuilding of the cities that have been laid waste. So they return to the land.
01:06:28 -  God says in Amos chapter 9 I will plant you in the land and you'll no more be plucked up or removed.
01:06:34 -  That's future. But it's not too distant. Is that when
01:06:42 -  Messiah is back on the earth? He's contained in the heavens, waiting
01:06:48 -  for the restoration of all things spoken by the prophets since the world began. The Lord's coming
01:06:54 -  is relative to the whole unfolding and climax of this drama. When does He come? When do His feet sit on the Mount
01:07:00 -  of Olives? When Israel, it is in the final throes of the threat of extinction, two thirds have already perished
01:07:06 -  in the land. And He comes in Zechariah 12 to pour
01:07:12 -  out the spirit of grace and supplications upon the city of David and to battle against those
01:07:18 -  all nations that have come against Jerusalem to destroy it. He becomes the visible deliverer
01:07:24 -  and we shall see Him whom we have pierced and mourn for Him as one mourns for one's only son
01:07:30 -  and for one's firstborn. So what we're going to see is the most profound national repentance
01:07:36 -  that has ever taken place in the history of salvation. There is no known individual repentance
01:07:42 -  but a national repentance of this depth and magnitude is so intense because when they shall see Him
01:07:48 -  all the things that you have been saying all the things that you have shared in your witness and when you have taken them into your homes
01:07:54 -  and have helped them on the way and they've turned the deaf ear and they've opposed you and something of that lodges
01:08:00 -  and when they see Him it brings to life all of the things that they've tried to close out.
01:08:06 -  It's a staggering penetrating revelation. Can you imagine my mother? I'm wondering how God's going to save her without her dying
01:08:12 -  from flight in the moment of His revelation. How will He accomplish this? Because in that moment
01:08:18 -  she'll realize that everything that her son and others have been trying to save for 36 years have been true. And I've said to
01:08:24 -  my mother once, she said, shut up! I don't want to hear that! Arthur, don't talk like that! I can't get a...
01:08:30 -  Hey, I'm a communicator. I'm God's prophet but to my own mother, I'm shut up!
01:08:36 -  When I get a word of advice, I say the day will come in eternity when you will lament and moan
01:08:42 -  not that I have said too much but that I have not said enough. So it's a grace to see Him
01:08:48 -  whom we have pierced but it will only be a surviving remnant that will see Him and every
01:08:54 -  family repents apart. Now, on what basis do we repent? God is not
01:09:00 -  even going to allow us that ability out of ourselves. He pours out a spirit of supplication
01:09:06 -  and grace that we might repent because we cannot take credit for
01:09:12 -  anything. From beginning to end, even repentance is a gift of God who will be made
01:09:18 -  unable. There'll be nothing in which we can millennially or eternally boast. God has become all in all.
01:09:24 -  Is that before the cities are rebuilt? Or after? Well, we're not given all that detail.
01:09:30 -  Evidently not rebuilt because He comes in the midst of warfare and there's devastation. He's slugging
01:09:36 -  Jerusalem from all the nations coming against Him to destroy it. And some of them are actually going to go
01:09:42 -  into the Mount of Olives, right? It's either going to stand on the Mount of Olives or it's going to cleave and they're going to
01:09:48 -  physically run in there to hide, right? I think so. I know it's a moot point but it's...
01:09:54 -  There are going to be great geophysical disturbances, there are earthquakes, earth splitting and in fact Jerusalem itself
01:10:00 -  is going to have to be raised up to a higher altitude than it ever enjoyed and it will become the city of the Most High.
01:10:06 -  I think so. I'd just like you to comment on Ezekiel 20
01:10:12 -  what transpires in the wilderness in terms of God's healing to the children of Israel. And the other thing is
01:10:18 -  I remember in the early days of the Charismatic Renewal when Hal Lindsay came up with his kind of
01:10:24 -  Pentecostal sort of trees, Lake Green Planet Earth where he does say that there's
01:10:30 -  going to come a devastation and a final battle and Israel's going to be attacked and everything like that.
01:10:36 -  So I find it unusual that you are going around telling people that such a thing is going to come to pass
01:10:42 -  and all these people are worrying about their ministries and Israel, I don't get it. There's a little difference between he and I.
01:10:48 -  No, I appreciate it. You understand that? Because he's saying that the church will have been raptured.
01:10:54 -  Yes, they're going through a time of trouble. Poor souls, let's pray for them. We will enjoy
01:11:00 -  safety being out of it. They'll be in it. And that's why that kind of a Christian operates toward Israel
01:11:06 -  with a sense of guilt. Because they're going to be saved out of something that the poor Jew is going to pass through.
01:11:12 -  I'm saying no. The church is in the earth at that time. There's no pre-tribulation rapture. We pass
01:11:18 -  through it with them. Because in Isaiah 35, when Israel is passing through the wilderness that is made
01:11:24 -  for them, we read at a certain point where God is speaking not to Israel but to some unidentified
01:11:30 -  entity who is with them in the wilderness and says, say to them, your God will come.
01:11:36 -  He will bring his recompense. He will deliver you. And when that word comes to a people who are bedraggled,
01:11:42 -  defeated, broken, ready to die, because the issue of death is not so much physical as it is moral.
01:11:48 -  And these people are without hope. No, someone needs to speak to them a word of hope before the visible
01:11:54 -  advent of a deliverer coming or they'll not even be alive to wait for that deliverance. And who is there to speak it?
01:12:00 -  That knows God so well that when they say, your God will come, the eyes
01:12:06 -  of the blind are opened and the lame leap and water breaks out of the dry ground because that statement is not
01:12:12 -  a hopeful, human, sentimental wish, but a prophetic declaration of a creative
01:12:18 -  kind that can only come to a church that has itself come to prophetic fullness.
01:12:24 -  But I still don't see why. I still don't see why people would reject your assertion that
01:12:30 -  there's coming and coming devastation to Israel. Wasn't that commonly accepted
01:12:36 -  amongst Charismatics? Of course, I have people arguing with me. Yes, you're right
01:12:42 -  Arthur, there's clearly a time of Jacob's trouble. But where we differ from you is this. We don't think that it's going to go as far
01:12:48 -  as you say. In other words, yes, it's a time of trouble, but not trouble to the point of extinction
01:12:54 -  or threat of death, but God will bring them through. And my point
01:13:00 -  is that there's no resurrection without death. It's not amelioration or progressive improvement that Israel
01:13:06 -  needs, but transformation that can only come from a resurrection that issues out of the death. But don't they accept the fact that
01:13:12 -  the tombs are going to be built during this time? Somehow it doesn't register. Or why are they buying prayer centers in Tel Aviv
01:13:18 -  and building prayer towers on Mount Carmel if there's going to be that kind of widespread devastation?
01:13:24 -  There's something about not being able to think the unthinkable and to avoid and to
01:13:30 -  shun from our consideration a scenario of an apocalyptic kind and somehow to soften it
01:13:36 -  and to give it a kind of view that we can mentally accept.
01:13:42 -  It's false. It's a saying peace when there is no peace. It's false prophets giving false assurances and
01:13:48 -  false comforts from the severity to which God must bring that people. And so when I say I'm speaking not only
01:13:54 -  out of my prophetic office and my understanding of scripture given to men in that office, but I'm speaking also
01:14:00 -  out of my understanding of the centrality of the wisdom of God which is the cross
01:14:06 -  and the absolute necessity for a suffering and a death which precedes a glory.
01:14:12 -  The issue is not the success of a nation state and giving Israel a national homeland however much that's to be
01:14:18 -  desired. The issue is the glory of God forever and that's going to require. There's no glory that is not
01:14:24 -  first preceded by a suffering. So the issue is really an ideological theological
01:14:30 -  difference over the centrality of the cross itself. And those Christians who want a
01:14:36 -  happier scenario for Israel are those who are trying to shun the issue of the cross for their own rights.
01:14:42 -  How do we pray for the peace of Jerusalem? How do we pray for the peace of Jerusalem? I have a whole message on that.
01:14:48 -  To pray authentically for the peace of Jerusalem is not a moment's afterthought. Okay, we've prayed everything.
01:14:54 -  Now let's pray this. God says we should. To pray for the peace of Jerusalem authentically is to pray
01:15:00 -  with the knowledge that that peace cannot come without their first being. The greatest devastation and judgment
01:15:06 -  and then the restoration return, the knowledge of God, and the peace of the past is understanding. To pray for the peace is to pray for what precedes it.
01:15:12 -  And who can pray that way? In fact, I said the issue of Israel is the issue of everything
01:15:18 -  in the last analysis, including the issue of prayer. Because when I finished my presentations the most precious
01:15:24 -  intercessors who've been praying for Israel for the success of the state and down with Arafat and praying
01:15:30 -  they said, well, how then should we pray? Arafat and the Palestinians may well be God's rod of chastisement. We're praying
01:15:36 -  against even God's will. How do we pray without erring? I said, ah, you're on new ground now.
01:15:42 -  Now you cannot pray out of your knowledge. Now you can't pray out of your human mind. Out of your opinion
01:15:48 -  of what you think is good. Because what you think is good might actually be in opposition to
01:15:54 -  God's intention and plan. Well, how then should we pray, God? You've got to pray out of the tree of life. You've got to
01:16:00 -  pray out of the spirit. You've got to groan and travail in things you don't understand and don't need to understand
01:16:06 -  but that the spirit has so the possession of your life that he who knows the mind of the Lord can groan
01:16:12 -  and travail through you and beyond to open the heavens and to bring that peace through the travail through which Israel must pass.
01:16:18 -  That means that the church is brought into an existential dimension of a reality that is not
01:16:24 -  an issue of personal prayer but corporate travail, corporate intercession, which means that just as we
01:16:30 -  said with the Lord, don't let our worship exceed the truth of the reality of our relationship
01:16:36 -  neither can prayer exceed that. Our prayers cannot be any more effectual than
01:16:42 -  the truth of the statement of our life together. See what I mean? So the issue of an
01:16:48 -  effectual travail of groaning by which a nation is birthed is the issue of a
01:16:54 -  people who can perform that together because they are together and not just alongside each other
01:17:00 -  sitting in pews. The ability can you pray with your wife, your husband? Isn't it amazing that many of us can't
01:17:06 -  because we have not a relationship of an intimacy of a kind. There are too many barriers
01:17:12 -  and hurts and things like that we can better pray with one we know at a less intimate basis than to
01:17:18 -  pray with the one closest. So that means that there's going to be an authentic travail that
01:17:24 -  opens the heavens and brings God's answer for people who are at the mercy of everything and have no thing in themselves.
01:17:30 -  The issue is the church, its condition, its quality, its character, the truth of its own relationship
01:17:36 -  because its prayer cannot exceed that truth. So in a word the issue of Israel once understood
01:17:42 -  as mystery brings a dimension of urgency to the issue of our
01:17:48 -  church life that was not there before. Its transport all of a sudden from an issue of happy and successful services
01:17:54 -  and programs to an urgency to come into a prophetic entity that can speak to a people
01:18:00 -  a word of not mere comfort but creative transformation that at the hearing of which their eyes are opened.
01:18:06 -  And that's going to be a corporate speaking as much as Ezekiel 37 of the son of man speaking
01:18:12 -  to the dry bones. There's not a single prophet but a prophetic entity whom
01:18:18 -  God can command to prophesy to those bones. See what I mean?
01:18:24 -  So there's an agenda for us that calls us to uttermost maturity to prophetic
01:18:30 -  reality. So what's my value for the church? Hold put your hand down. My value for the church is
01:18:36 -  that in my own person and in my own call and in my own struggle and in my own life
01:18:42 -  and in my own reality which you can see and feel and touch and hear is your own call.
01:18:48 -  The church itself is called to be a prophetic entity. Yes I know that there are distinguished
01:18:54 -  and individual callings. I have one myself but that we mustn't misunderstand that
01:19:00 -  the church as a corporate entity has itself a prophetic designation and a call. And in fact unless it
01:19:06 -  finds that and is able to fulfill that in reality and truth, Israel has no chance.
01:19:12 -  Because when we're called in that moment of time and it will only come once to address those bones because we're commanded
01:19:18 -  what if we don't feel like it that day? What if it's not our best day? You know what I find? That the greatest
01:19:24 -  demands that come upon me where life and death hangs in the balance or I have to speak to four thousand people in a once in a while time,
01:19:30 -  I'm not at my best but at my worst. I'm not rested. I'm not inspired. I'm banged up, wiped out
01:19:36 -  like I was Friday night when I arrived with you guys. But I cannot withhold myself from an obedience
01:19:42 -  because I'm some kind of prima donna that requires optimum
01:19:48 -  and perfect conditions. Because the great things that will be required of us on the last days is when we're least in that
01:19:54 -  ability and least feel ourselves able and yet are people who will move with God's command
01:20:00 -  and will move together as one with one voice or the word will fall limply to the
01:20:06 -  ground. That means all of our subjective variations and opinions and I don't know about this and I don't know about
01:20:12 -  that will prevent us from speaking that one word in the fullness that comes when people have one mind one heart
01:20:18 -  and one will and can be commanded and have the faith to believe that the word out of their mouth
01:20:24 -  will raise the dead. We can believe God can do it but can we believe that we
01:20:30 -  can do it? Are we in that union with God that our word is his word? That we can command the elements
01:20:36 -  to cease and that we can raise the dead? It seems to us presumptuous. And the last thing that we're called to do having spoken
01:20:42 -  to the bones in their form is to now address the breath. Speak to the ruach.
01:20:48 -  Speak to the spirit of God because unless the spirit comes in they're still dead even with their bones in their flesh.
01:20:54 -  Oh Lord I could speak to the bones but you want me to command you? You are the ruach.
01:21:00 -  You're the Holy Spirit. I should command you? Whom I are? So in the last analysis even
01:21:06 -  our religious inhibitions and our sense of propriety being
01:21:12 -  violated. I should command you? God says unless you command me they'll perish. So you've
01:21:18 -  got to transcend even your own sense of propriety in what seems in every
01:21:24 -  way externally to be an arrogance is actually ultimate humility because humility
01:21:30 -  is obedience to God even in those things which offend our own sensibilities. That's what I've been speaking to you guys
01:21:36 -  in these days. Praise God for tonight. It's all coming together. But how you're going to come to that condition
01:21:42 -  is not by a magical wand it's going to be by a process of your own obedience as the
01:21:48 -  thrashing out of your own issues that come into these realities and that's the issue of Israel's deliverance.
01:21:56 -  So what's going to happen in the wilderness? Okay. Ezekiel chapter 20
01:22:04 -  from verse 33. You know what it says in italics over that break in the chapter
01:22:10 -  of my Bible? God will restore Israel. Chapter
01:22:16 -  20 of Ezekiel from verse 33 As I live says the Lord God
01:22:22 -  surely with a mighty hand with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out
01:22:28 -  I will be king over you. Remember Israel's last national statement? We will not have this
01:22:34 -  man to rule over us. Remember that? What that has cost us for two thousand years. We will not have this man.
01:22:40 -  Give us season. Give us Barabbas. We will not have this man. God says I will rule over you. Because if I
01:22:46 -  don't rule over you how shall I rule over the nations? You're first and foremost if I don't
01:22:52 -  rule over you. I have no credence, no credibility, no authority with nations. You're first. And if it's going to take a fury
01:22:58 -  and it's going to take a fury, why? Because we're opinionating self-willed. We want to do our own thing.
01:23:04 -  We're autonomous. We want to establish our own state. I will rule over you with a fury poured out. That fury
01:23:10 -  is the time of Jacob's trouble. I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of
01:23:16 -  the countries where you are scattered. And we are in every nation in the world. I have found Jews in Singapore,
01:23:22 -  in Yugoslavia, in Egypt. It doesn't matter. We're scattered. And if we're not presently there we will be there.
01:23:28 -  And that's part of the whole thing of expulsion that I can tell you about. The
01:23:34 -  Filipinos, hey, there'll be Jews trekking through your jungles. They may not be native
01:23:40 -  to the Philippines, but they'll be brought there. I can tell the nation of New Zealand that it'll not just be Jews passing through the wilderness
01:23:46 -  of the nation, your whole nation will be wilderness. So somehow there's something select in your whole nation.
01:23:52 -  Why? Because God is not only sifting Jews, he's sifting the nations themselves and the church within
01:23:58 -  the nations so that no one can be with excuse. When did I see you hungry thirsty? Everyone will have had
01:24:04 -  an opportunity to see them, for they will pass through all nations. This is the issue of interpretation.
01:24:10 -  When God says all, he means all. And in Amos chapter 9, I will sift you through all
01:24:16 -  nations, not only for your sake, but because I have a controversy with nations
01:24:22 -  and they're going to be tested over the issue I present to them through you. That's why this
01:24:28 -  can't be prayed away. People say, well, can't we pray that Israel will repent without having? No.
01:24:34 -  This is God's massive last day's testimony to the nations and it cannot be altered.
01:24:44 -  With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, in verse 34 it's mentioned a second time.
01:24:50 -  Any time God speaks twice. The same thing. Take note.
01:24:56 -  When he says wrath poured out, it has to repeat it. Well, what else would remove Jews from
01:25:02 -  Toronto? You know, the penthouse apartments or
01:25:08 -  Steven Spielberg's Long Island summer home or the places of prominence and affluence and comfort that
01:25:14 -  Jews enjoy. It will have to be a fury. Oh, you dear saints. I was in Berlin
01:25:20 -  living in the apartment of a Christian couple, attending a conference on prayer for Israel that made me
01:25:26 -  my guts not. And I was told that this was a
01:25:32 -  Jewish neighborhood and I knew somehow in my spirit intuitively that I was in the apartment of
01:25:38 -  Jews in the Nazi time. And I came back one night and I had a vivid sense
01:25:44 -  of the Jew, of that apartment hearing the stomping of the jackboots up the stairs, coming up
01:25:50 -  the stairs, knowing that the dreaded knock was coming upon his door. And within moments he was going to be apprehended
01:25:56 -  and he's in a fury, he's breaking out of a sweat. What do I take? What photographs? What memorabilia? What things of my
01:26:02 -  life, my books, my treasures, my music, my records? And whew, it's upon him and everything
01:26:08 -  is lost. They're uprooted and face the prospect of death because a fury
01:26:14 -  was poured out. And Jesus says that the one that is coming will exceed the one that was passed.
01:26:20 -  Not so much in its savage brutality, but in its magnitude. That was confined to Europe.
01:26:26 -  This one will be global. And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and there I will
01:26:34 -  enter into judgment with you face to face. Other Bibles express it another way. Do you have another?
01:26:40 -  I will plead my deeds with you face to face. Plead with you. So it's God entreating, a God
01:26:46 -  explaining, which means that you're not only going to be required to provide physical sustenance in your refuge,
01:26:52 -  but prophetic and biblical and spiritual explanations. God will plead with you. These Jews are going to
01:26:58 -  be totally deranged and beside themselves in the confusion and stupor of what is before them.
01:27:04 -  And you're going to have to sit them down, calm them. And they'll say, how did you know we were coming?
01:27:10 -  How is it you anticipated us and prepared for us? And because they're going to be moving from place to place in the whole
01:27:16 -  economy of places of refuge, God will have established by His Spirit. So my son Davis is dead.
01:27:22 -  You're central in all this. And you know this people to the north of you, to the south of you. You know them from Canada to Mexico, which is
01:27:28 -  the route by the way. Why don't you establish a circular letter? Why don't you organize? I say no.
01:27:34 -  There must be no human organization at all. This must be the patent revelation
01:27:40 -  of God and His majestic glory by His Spirit. And the whole thing is relational and trust face
01:27:46 -  to face in relationship that has been tested and to which we have passed.
01:27:52 -  We were solely tested over the gladiator.
