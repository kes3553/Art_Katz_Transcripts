Last Days Tumult

00:00 -  You know the way the Lord will quicken certain things right on the spot and use little inauspicious things, like a button that somebody is wearing on their lapel and the scriptures that the Spirit induces a man to read to move you in a certain direction?
00:15 -  How many people know what I'm talking about? It's called being led of the Spirit. As I came in here today, there was a young chap wearing a button.
00:24 -  It said, the great snatch, and it showed a pair of pants and pair of shoes just passing out of sight, being lifted up into sweet oblivion. Then our brother read certain scriptures and as he was reading them, my eye fell on passages,
00:40 -  which I suppose that I'd read before, but the Lord just chose this moment for me to see them in a little pointed way that I hadn't before noticed. So let's turn back to Mark the 13th chapter, 19th verse.
00:58 -  For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation, which God created unto this time, neither shall be. And except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved.
01:16 -  But for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. Does that sound to you as if we're going to be snatched out? It's as if we're, it's, I'm not a theologian, guys, so I won't presume to announce anything,
01:33 -  but I always have a rather queasy feeling about the great snatch. And my experience now, and the direction in which the Lord is leading me, seems to suggest everything to the contrary.
01:45 -  I mean, the Lord has given me visions also, the most recent of which was a vision to establish conferences on discipleship, and that young people especially, and those who are committed and really want to walk with God, might understand what it is that's going to be required from
02:05 -  them in this day, and to begin to shape themselves by the grace of God to be fitted for this day. That doesn't, that doesn't seem economical of a Jewish God to deal with people in that
02:19 -  way if we're just going to be, in those days shall be affliction. Well, how many of you precious young people have ever tasted of any affliction in your life at all?
02:33 -  Any affliction. Have you? At least my claim to fame was that I was a depression baby.
02:40 -  You actually knew real want, real privation, real struggle, just for physical existence. And some of the other greyheads and older people in the audience this morning can remember those days.
02:54 -  But you know that your generation is about the most spoiled, the most grossly indulged, softest, probably in the history of our civilization. I think it's rather ironic that Jesus says in the third verse, verily I sent you, this
03:12 -  generation shall not pass till all these things be done. The twenty-fourth verse, but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its light and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers
03:29 -  that are in the heavens shall be shaken and then they that shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost parts of the earth to the
03:47 -  uttermost part of heaven. Then after those days shall he send his angels to select, to gather up. I just have to say again that I'm not a theologian and I don't want to make, suggest any definitive
04:05 -  statement about what the character of those days is going to be, but I have just a pre-sentiment, a sense that if we're not going to pass through the whole of it, we're certainly going to pass through a portion of it and I believe it's going to have something to do with purifying
04:22 -  the body of Christ, with preparing that bride that will be without spot and without wrinkle How many of you young people are conscious this morning that the bride of Christ and the body of Christ is very far yet from that condition?
04:38 -  Many corruptions, right? Many fleshly carnal things, much that is passed in the name of Christianity is hardly better than mere entertainment, shallow, casual.
04:51 -  And perhaps it is because of the kind of ministry that the Lord has given us, university campuses and encounters with atheistic groups, with radicals, with Jewish people like myself, that we begin to get a sense of what the sharp response of men is going to be to the gospel
05:10 -  in the last days. I think the issue is becoming joined and heretofore the world has looked upon us with a kind of nonchalance.
05:18 -  We've fitted in quite well, we've condoned the establishment, we've sanctified establishment life, they could safely allow us to go about our little Christian business on Sunday because we didn't threaten a thing.
05:32 -  But I tell you that when the walk becomes more intense, when the issue will become more severely joined, when the centrifugal forces which are now at work in the earth polarizing and sucking people into one of two great centers, light or darkness, when these forces are more
05:53 -  revealed, when men will see that the neutral ground is fast disappearing and they're going to be required to make radical commitment to one or the other, I think we're going to see more and more men railing, gnashing their teeth.
06:07 -  We're going to experience what the scriptures describe, that those who live Godly lives in Christ will suffer persecution. And I just want to share with you some observations out of a text in the scriptures which the
06:21 -  Lord has really quickened to my heart in the 16th chapter of the book of Acts. Because I love to see in the scriptures the pattern of God, the way of God. And I realize that the things that are written here are not just mere historical descriptions
06:41 -  of episodes from the lives of Jewish men who served him, but a real framework, a pattern, an indication of things which must be and always are. And I can't begin to share with you my experience in the things which the Lord has pressed into
06:59 -  my own heart, but I can just say it with finality and you just wait on your own heart and spirit. Guys, not a cotton-picking thing has changed, nothing. Not a thing has changed.
07:11 -  The issues are exactly the same as it was in the days of Jesus. The forces that are in contention are just as severely in contention now. We've gone through a 19th century kind of samambulism and sleepwalk, but at the end
07:30 -  of the ages the cover is being lifted back and we're going to see the same kinds of things that punctuated and characterized the ministry of Jesus and the disciples which followed him. Interesting that every one of them suffered the fate of martyrs.
07:46 -  Interesting that the word for witness in Greek means martyr. And so I just want to strike a very somber note from the beginning. Will you excuse me?
07:56 -  I'm just not one of the rah rah rah guys and you might just be able to shake this off after an hour or two as the meetings go on, but I've got to speak the thing which is in my heart.
08:07 -  I'll tell you the kind of feeling I have, that there's a great corollary between, as we know, the natural and the spiritual worlds. We know that in the world of nature, there's a great process of attrition.
08:22 -  A fish can spawn many thousands of eggs and out of these perhaps only several hundred will survive the initial process of birth. And of those hundreds, many fewer will survive the first stages of life to become fingerlings.
08:41 -  And of these, most will be condemned or will condemn themselves to live out their little stunted lives around the periphery of great bodies of water, living in the shallows and the scum.
08:54 -  But one or two will forge out into the deep to take all of the attendant risks that come with launching out into the deep and also enable themselves to enjoy that process that leads to full growth and maturity.
09:10 -  But they have to survive the risks that come with predators and sportsmen. And maybe out of all the initial birth of thousands of eggs, one will survive to come to full maturity that it might reproduce itself.
09:25 -  And I got that same kind of sneaky suspicion that's exactly true of the things which are spiritual. Frankly, guys, I'm just a little bit wary of the enormous popularity that Jesus is enjoying
09:36 -  in our day. He's just so groovy that I can hardly recognize the Jesus who had not a place to lay his head, from whom hundreds turned when he said that you must eat of my flesh and drink of my blood.
09:51 -  When even his choicest disciples who walked with him for three and a half years fled from him in the time of his greatest crisis and affliction, would not even believe the accounts of his resurrection from the lips of first-hand witnesses, I got a feeling there's going to
10:11 -  be a great process of attrition take place. And many that are on the bandwagon today grooving with Jesus are not going to survive the enormous, what can I say, trial and testing that's going to come in our day.
10:27 -  So I'm speaking today to prepare you for an hour which is not yet struck, okay? And I'm choosing the 16th chapter of the book of Acts because I believe that it gives us a pattern that we're going to see duplicated.
10:41 -  And it's just an ordinary day in the lives of two Jews for Jesus doing their Jewish thing, serving their most high God. And they're about doing the thing which the Lord commanded them to preach the gospel.
10:56 -  Now we begin with the sixth verse. Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, after they would come to Mygia they attempted
11:06 -  to go into Bethania but the Spirit allowed them not. And day passing by Mygia came down to Troas and a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia beseeching him and saying, come over into Macedonia and
11:20 -  help us. I think we ought to pause there first to remind you that I'm doing gross injustice to the word of God by this kind of glib and casual reading, but I believe that this is the kind
11:33 -  of reading that characterizes the reading that most of us do. We don't give the word of God the extreme reverence and care that it deserves. We were instructed to live by every word which proceeds out of the mouth of God.
11:51 -  And I think that many of us are missing the deep things which God has inserted in this word by our very casualness in just breezing through it. I believe that my first year as a believer was wasted because I brought to the word of
12:04 -  God the same kind of slick and shallow habits that I had developed in the academic world and I even was self presumptuous as to think that I had to interpret the scripture as I interpreted Shakespeare and Milton and other writings.
12:19 -  It was a wasted year. I spun my wheels in vain until the Lord brought me up short and I realized that this is not just literature.
12:27 -  This is the word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. I began to take it with the seriousness and earnestness it deserves and to do it, my life started to become radically transformed.
12:41 -  You know that we just read of three manifestations of the Holy Spirit, three very vital manifestations that those of us who are in the dimension, the charismatic full gospel dimension, ought most of all to acknowledge, to respect, to celebrate.
13:00 -  See, being filled with the Holy Spirit is more than just elation, it's an enormous equipment for service. And I just began this morning by just describing the very modest way by which the Spirit of
13:16 -  God was already operating in me, to direct me to speak and to be a channel for him to address you in a given way. Just by allowing my eye to fall on a button, just by having my spirit quickened by the
13:28 -  reading of certain scriptures and by a certain weight subtle on my heart by the Holy Spirit. Now look at this first verse, guys. We talk about the Holy Spirit and we always think of the Spirit as one that leads us,
13:40 -  but here's the Spirit of God which checks us. It says they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, and you say aren't impossible.
13:50 -  The Spirit of God is not going to contradict the word of God, didn't we have commandment to go into all the world and preach this gospel to every creature? Well I want to tell you something about the Spirit of God, that we ought to be prepared
14:03 -  at any given moment for the Spirit of God so to lead us, even for God to set aside the things which we think and know are established in his word. The Spirit of God can do anything in and through that vessel yielded to him.
14:20 -  And what is in fact the great hindrance to the receiving of the baptism of the Holy Spirit among denominational people in our generation? They've got certain fixed principles which in a sense really are biblical, which prevent
14:34 -  them from understanding and entering into a dimension which God has for them. The Spirit of God is always in the last analysis. God's current choice voice to move, to direct, to check, to stop.
14:53 -  I was telling an Assemblies of God pastor last night how at a church of that denomination the Spirit of God bade me to mock a congregation, and you say all right now I know you've flipped. The Spirit of God is loving and he'll never mock his own people, and I tell you that whatever
15:11 -  breath in my body and anything I know about God, the Spirit of God passed through my mouth and mocked a congregation that had just sung a really rosy song full of clapping of hands and full of lifted up spirits, we need Jesus, you need Jesus, I need Jesus, and I tell you
15:31 -  I looked out on that congregation of seemingly healthy folk and the young choir was singing full of gusto and verve, and I thought man I have need to be minister to them, but when I opened my mouth it was God who mocked them, I need Jesus, you need Jesus, and following
15:49 -  that was I just say like a sword proceeding forth into the bosom of that people, one word, really, and people go catching their breath all over that audience because the Lord zapped them, and I went on to speak just like a fool, what do you need him for, take up an offering,
16:07 -  play a church, preach a pretty little sermon, do a little singing, we don't need him for that people, we need him in the extremity, we need him when we're utterly obedient to follow him in the places to which he shall lead us, we need him when we're utterly over our own heads, when our power
16:28 -  and our own human resources and intellect and heart and courage are wanting, but how many of us have ever been so led by the Spirit to places like that, it's no longer the groovy Christianity, it far more resembles the book of Acts, that's when we need him, and I'll tell you one of my
16:47 -  greatest disappointments as a young believer taking up my place in the Pentecostal congregation eight years ago, was the failure to see the correspondence in the life of that church and its place in the community and the book of Acts which I believe was the normative standard of
17:04 -  conduct and service for the locals, the God of the book of Acts has not changed one bit but we have, there's a spirit of God that's sovereign who could not only lead but check, my first such experiences that came at a college, actually a Pentecostal college where I always trembled
17:29 -  of what would happen if the Lord would have to use me to cast out a demon spirit, I wouldn't, I didn't mind laying on hands for healing because you can always safely walk away from that with your pride intact, you don't have to see the necessary evidence on the spot, it's an easy
17:43 -  and sometimes a cheap thing to do but one who's bound and needs to be set free is quite another thing, I thought that the spirits would turn and rend me and say Jesus I know and Paul I know but cat's food? God has given us a name which is above every name but do we actually have the
18:06 -  authority to exercise it? Are we so separated from the world? We've come out and we've touched not the unclean thing and he's been made a father unto us, we are his sons and his daughters and we speak and do with an authority that is something more than the mechanical citation of the name of
18:28 -  Jesus. So right in a college one night about one o'clock in the morning I've been up all through the day I was the chapel speaker, I was counseling kids and that night there was a devotional thing in the dormitory and I was coming back to my bunk just weary and would you believe it one
18:43 -  o'clock in the morning in that narrow hallway there's a student reading to both my board, I thought that's unusual and the hallway was so narrow I brushed shoulders with this guy and he said oh hi Mr. Cantor said hi fellow and I just had one or two pleasant words with him I said
18:59 -  click I was checked by the spirit I said say you want to talk to me about anything? Oh no he said I said are you sure? Well then good night good night I started to walk again check I said are you sure that you don't have something that you want to share with me? Well he said not something
19:20 -  that you'd probably really be interested in I said are you walking this way? He said yeah and I just walked with me we began to walk with me we hadn't walked 50 paces when this kid who was the son of a minister told me that he was on the verge of suicide that he was possessed by spirits
19:38 -  of murder and anger and bitterness which he could not control and he was at the end of his rope and something in my heart went I knew that the Lord had backed me into a corner you know people I'm just as chicken as most and I see that it's always been the Lord backing me into corners in
19:58 -  fact I was saved by being backed into a corner I was backed into a corner in Jerusalem by having gotten on a mistaken bus to find myself lost and walked into a bookstore for directions to find out that it was a bookstore selling New Testaments and Bibles operated by Jewish believers in the
20:14 -  Messiah a Pentecostal Jewish assembly and it was in that bookstore that the Lord spoke to me and told me that I was not to leave he backed me into a corner and every act of service and every kind of commitment is almost the same kind of thing God was behind me doing this well I prayed with that
20:32 -  boy I knew that there was only one remedy I laid hands upon him in the name of Jesus I took authority against the spirit of murder spirit of suicide and I don't know what else that the spirit of God inspired me to pray and I left him at that chapel and I walked across campus the next
20:48 -  morning and I saw a guy coming toward me and he looked familiar he was not familiar and sure enough it was the same guy but he bore a new face just joyous swimming with life it had worked so be prepared people as you walk on with God that there's a spirit that will not only beckon you go
21:08 -  there's a spirit that may likely beckon you stop be checked be redirected the spirit allowed them not and a vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man of Macedonia beseeching him and saying come over into Macedonia and help us and maybe you're saying gee I've never had a vision
21:25 -  like that let me give you a little clue there are a lot of us who have never had any of these manifestations of the Holy Spirit you say but art why well I've got a few things I'd like to suggest that such manifestations as these only come to a choice few those who are prepared
21:45 -  to obey because look at the next verse and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them brother that's what it means to be a Jew is to receive vision of God
22:06 -  and immediately endeavor to go no if ands but whys or hows how many of us will say to you I know about that vision maybe it was indigestion maybe it was too much pastrami and corned beef I better wait to see that this is confirmed and blah blah blah blah blah how come that they knew
22:25 -  instantly that this was of God I'll tell you how come because their walk was such that they were familiar with the still small voice walking in the spirit is not something that's accomplished in a day it's a walk and I tell you it begins right where you are now and if you're insensitive
22:47 -  to hearing that still small voice of God and run roughshod over it in things that pertain to your life now how then shall you hear when he speaks even more inaudibly and more dangerously summoning you to places of service that might require your life I spoke at a college campus outdoors in a
23:08 -  public meeting big crowd and noise and tumult and had been speaking about the still small voice of God and when it was over some of these kids came up to me and were really curious about this what do you mean by the still small voice are you putting us on I don't speak about the still small
23:25 -  voice lightly I heard it that day in Jerusalem and it turned my life around because it called me by name and commanded me not to leave I've heard that voice since on platforms waiting to be called upon to speak and various other times of ministry and service I know it's a very real
23:42 -  voice they said well how do you know it's God's voice and not Satan's good question isn't it and just as that question was asked there's a big shaggy mutt wending its way through that plaza that campus and it wasn't just aimlessly wandering it was on target it was going somewhere
24:01 -  I said to these guys look at that dog in all of this great crowd and all this tumult and noise and all of this distraction that dog is not one with distracted it's going exactly to where it knows it needs to go it has heard its master's voice out of all of that great tumult of voices
24:19 -  it's picked out its master's voice we have the kind of devotion that animals have with their tongues lolling out of their mouths palpitating and panting just to be in the presence of their master
24:36 -  savoring that presence knowing him in a way that is beyond words anticipating even the wishes of a master not just waiting for his direct commandments harkening to his voice desiring to be at his side always prepared to do his bidding
24:55 -  God help us to be as devoted to him as shaggy animals are to men who are not worthy of it how many of us have seen a vision of a man decking us to come over into Macedonia and help you know I think we don't see it how many of us are in a position to do it
25:15 -  how many can come to Macedonia and bring help how many of us far more need help ourselves how much of our own prayer life is occupied with the distress of our own personal lives and our fallings and stumblings and backslidings and indecision and weakness and all the rest of
25:31 -  these things children the vision of God comes and the spirit of God beckons those who will immediately endeavor to go and those whose lives are so ordered and disciplined in God that they can bring help and let's just follow on to see what the consequence of obedience
25:51 -  results in therefore losing and in the other 11th verse from trials we came with a straight course to Samothraecia in the next state of neapolis and from there to Philippi which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia see wherever the spirit of God leads us is where
26:06 -  the action is it's the chief city it may be to an audience of one or two it might be to some little hick town it might be to New York City it might be to Jerusalem but wherever God leads you you can be assured that's where the action is and there's a God who delights in those who set forth
26:25 -  with a straight course to reach it I was speaking last night about some guy that visited me in Kansas City I guess you would call him a Jesus freak or whatever hair down his shoulders barefoot his shirt unbuttoned down
26:40 -  to his navel Jesus plastered all over that shirt and real groovy and swinging and love the Lord quote unquote and told me that he wanted to work with me and he wanted to be a work with me and he wanted to be a missionary to the Jewish people he thought that that would be
27:00 -  just groovy I said well what background do you have you had what experience have you had well nothing what's your what's been your most recent work while I was a dishwasher how long did that last about a week well have you gone to college well I copped out or I quit in my freshman year
27:17 -  were you in the service yeah but I lasted a few months and I was discharged I said what have you ever done that systematic and disciplined and he said nothing I don't think that that man is prepared to enter a ministry that's very demanding
27:38 -  there's a God who wants us to set forth with a straight course and you young kids who are in school a lot of you when I speak with you in colleges and places like that you sort of suggest gee when I get out of school when life will begin what's the Lord's will for me and then
27:53 -  you ask questions like that and I'm always constantly amazed that you don't recognize that right where you are now right in school and right in your present situation and right in your present relationships with friends classmates teachers and parents you have every opportunity
28:12 -  to come to a place of discipline of a controlled life of maturity that when the vision of God beckons you you can bring help to men and so as we read on we read that they went to on the Sabbath in the 13th verse to a out of the city by the riverside where prayer was accustomed to be made
28:33 -  and we sat down and spoke unto the women who resorted there isn't it funny you know I never understood that why they would be led outside the city my natural instinct would have been to have gone to the greatest synagogue to see what opportunity they would have had there but
28:47 -  the spirit of God led them in a place where the natural mind does not dictate and those of us who call ourselves full gospel have got to understand that that this is what the spirit of God is all about to be filled with the spirit to be empowered by the spirit and to be led by the spirit even to
29:05 -  foolish places that contradict our own reason and understanding and a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Piatira who worshiped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul and when she was baptized
29:21 -  and her household she besought us saying if if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us I just can't help but take a moment before passing on from these beautiful verses just to remind you what kind of a woman
29:39 -  this is what a refreshing contrast the kinds of indecisive believers that we see in our own day wishy-washy lukewarm compromised this woman was decisive whose heart the Lord opened that she attended to the things which were spoken attending to the things which were spoken
29:58 -  you know I went to Hebrew school as a kid we all have to perform that chore to prepare us for our 13th year for our bar mitzvah it was a drag and I used to try to play hooky whenever I could and I used to sit in that class just like a zombie dead but I remember after being there for years one
30:14 -  day a new kid came into a class and he was just a few months short of his 13th birthday and he was going to make up in a few months what I had been laboring for six years to learn and I had a revelation of what it means to become a student this kid in a sense spiritually rolled up his
30:35 -  sleeves and unbuttoned his shirt and began to dig in and to learn the alphabet alif vet vet gimbal dollop eva and my eyes went pink I saw a guy who was diligently applying himself to learn he attended to the things which were spoken by an active assertion a conscious act of will
31:00 -  and in a moment I was made to realize that all my school years not only in the Hebrew school but even in secular school I've been sitting like like a lump and by osmosis I was just allowing a little kind of nonsense to infiltrate my consciousness I wonder how many of us are guilty
31:16 -  of that kind of thing even in churches even in our congregations and assemblies even when we hear the word of God are we consciously extending ourselves are we attending to the things which are spoken because look at the response and when she was baptized isn't that fantastic isn't the
31:37 -  bible as beautiful for what it leaves out as for what it says no if and but why she attends the things which are spoken she knew what the truth of God she was baptized immediately and her household I want to tell you guys that we Jews have some I think a deeper recognition of the
31:56 -  profundity of baptism than most Christians because the Jewish kid could come home from school and say to his mom mom I believe that Jesus is the Messiah and his mother will say that's nice Irving sit down and eat your lunch so they'll come home a few weeks later and say mom
32:11 -  I've been baptized into Jesus Christ she'll say you're no longer my son you're dead baptism is death it's going down into the deep waters of death they come up and cover you ahead you're going six feet under death to self to the world to the devil and coming up onto resurrection of
32:33 -  newness of life it's interesting that if you want to apply as a Jew for immigration to Israel they ask you what your religious identification is and you can say messianic Judaism or something like that but the real minute great question is have you been baptized because if you've been
32:51 -  baptized you've been sealed off from the world from Judaism from tradition from culture and you've been entered into another dimension which is hostile and at enmity with the world and at enmity with the world this woman who attended the things which were spoken
33:06 -  was baptized and her household what commitment and look at this she constrains these dangerous Jewish radicals to come into her house and to abide there well you know in a couple of days they're going to be leaving town but she's going to remain and bear the stigma and the public
33:25 -  reproach not only for her public baptism but for having taken these dangerous radicals into her own home I tell you guys that's a refreshing example it's a vision that God is holding up against our eyes that we might be reminded of what commitment means in an age that's so
33:43 -  wishy-washy and so indecisive that just about anything goes and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain maid possessed with a spirit of divination met us who brought her masses much gained by soup banks and the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants
33:59 -  of the most high God and shall unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour just an ordinary everyday episode in the life of a new
34:17 -  testament believer Paul being grieved turned it wasn't that Paul was irritated by this distraction he was grieved he was broken in his heart for a woman who was possessed of satanic spirits whose life was not her own now I tell you I believe that that's one of the conditions
34:36 -  for ministry of healing deliverance it's a faith which workers by love not that we're bugged or irritated but that we're grieved with a broken condition of men who need to be set free it's faith that operates by that love which will set the captives free and I just want to show you
34:56 -  what the consequence of this kind of new testament obedience and walk is because when her masses saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and drew them into the marketplace and under the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men beings used to
35:12 -  exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive needs to observe being romans and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them
35:26 -  they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks I tell you that we're not going to win the junior chamber of commerce award for being children of God but more likely
35:43 -  we're going to experience what these men experience when we walk in the power of the holy spirit with the same anointing that Jesus knew to set the captive free and bring the good news to give help to the lame we're going to find ourselves touching the world system right
36:02 -  at its core and there's going to be a howl and a shriek and a gnashing of teeth we're going to be dragged before rulers in high places in the marketplace in the establishment in the whole world system and the mob will be against us we're going to find ourselves humiliated to close
36:17 -  torn from our backs beaten cast in the dungeons to be bound hand and foot that's the reward of the obedience for following the holy spirit I believe that this is a pattern of God which we should realistically anticipate in our own work and you're wondering gee what did Paul and Silas
36:37 -  do after that to find themselves in this dungeon with their back back hanging in strips and pain I was in the dungeon which Paul lived his last days in Rome and I had a stoop over I couldn't stand direct and the black walls glistened with sweat and even centuries after his use as a prison
36:55 -  there was still the sickly smell of urine and and one can imagine the scurrying of rats with a little light flickering in that terrible overwhelming darkness that's where Paul wrote some of his greatest epistles a dungeon is not a pretty place let alone the sit there as men are doing right now
37:13 -  as we're sitting in this gorgeous place in dungeons today in ugly places of confinement behind the iron curtain suffering be humiliated strapped to crosses having other prisoners defecate over their faces being compelled to serve communion with human feces and urine
37:30 -  only a beginning of the kinds of affliction which God would say said would come in the last days I wonder if we're preparing ourselves for such eventualities as that it may be that we're never we may never be required to experience it but I think it's best to prepare ourselves
37:49 -  for the reality of what we we suspect might come upon us how did they how did Paul and Silas respond then did they say oh God what happened I thought I was being obedient to the holy spirit and look what's happened they've thrown us into this jail we've been beaten we're sitting in pain
38:03 -  where did we go wrong because a lot of us have suffered much less things than having our backs bloodied and being reproached and persecuted by the world we didn't get the grade we wanted on an examination or we were stood up by a boyfriend or our parents have misunderstood our motives or
38:19 -  intentions and we mope and we're forlorn and we're sad and with distress and our faces hang down and our faces hang down what then shall we do if we react that way now when we shall come to situations like this how do these men react I think one of the greatest verses in the whole
38:37 -  scripture comes in the 25th verse of the 16th chapter at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God wow well that's one thing to pray and to sing praises in full gospel conventions hallelujah what a wonderful spirit what a camaraderie all the wonderful bear hugs
38:57 -  and embraces and isn't it great but to be able to do it in a dungeon bound hand and foot with a back that's bloody and raw having been publicly humiliated if you can sing praises then you've got it all together now I'll tell you guys this is what the baptism of the holy spirit is about
39:20 -  it's not that we might just have it but that we might have joy and a basis for worship not just when things are going good but in the depths of our utmost crisis and severity and extremity one of the most brilliant testimonies that I ever read for speaking with other tongues
39:38 -  came from the wife of Richard Wombron that Jewish minister who was 13 years in a communist prison camp three and a half years in solitary confinement his wife herself was I believe seven years also in prisons and there came a time when she would not rat and and would not give the
39:56 -  information that these communist authorities wanted about the other believers in their Romanian community and they tortured that woman they put her through the mill and the last thing they did was the ultimate torture they put her in a box a box with spikes in it that you could neither
40:13 -  stand fully erect and nor could you sit nor could you slump because the moment you leaned against the side these things began to pierce into your flesh the box was dark barely enough air to breathe it was suffocating our hearts even begin to palpitating pounds just hearing
40:28 -  a description of this let alone to have experienced it the kind of thing that that made many prisoners go mad and they left them in that box for days and she said that she went out of her mind the fear gripped her in that terrible darkness and confinement she could no longer think she
40:45 -  couldn't remember scripture verses but in the depth of her extremity she heard something well up from the depths of her inmost being and she heard herself praising God in the language of praise and worship and that sustained her sanity God has given us an exquisite exquisite and precious
41:08 -  gift of the spirit and I know for myself and probably for many of you I sprained for a long time that I might have it and once I had it I kind of just languished back into the same kind of casual state as before I had it but the Lord showed me after a long time of disuse when I
41:29 -  sat one day on my couch four o'clock in the morning in Kansas City having been called to that city to establish a work for the Jews and to be filled with frustration and defeat we're still waiting to see the effects of my labors I said Lord is this speaking with tongues something worth having
41:44 -  has this got anything to do with service do I need the operation of this in my life if this is something more than just a kind of a flourish and more than just an it I ask you right now as I sit in this dark house on this couch in my gotgas and my underwear to loose my tongue and
42:01 -  I began right then having the spirit revived in me and began to worship the Lord with other tongues guys don't treat lightly the precious and exquisite thing which God has given you and understand truly what its purpose is an instrument of worship it's a gift by
42:22 -  which we can supplicate and groan in the spirit that the Lord might have transacted upon earth such things that we're describing today out of his word through ordinary vessels like ourselves because you know what that 25th verse ends with it says that they sang praises unto God
42:41 -  and prayed and the prisoners heard them hallelujah I tell you you can take all of the so-called witnessing in the world and all of the four spiritual laws and every evangelistic crusade and all of that hulkum and send it out down the river in a raft and it won't begin to provide the
42:59 -  results that will come when prisoners will hear our praise in the moment of adversity and crisis you want kids to be saved in your classes you let them see a face that's filled with joy not just when things are going well but when they know that you're suffering affliction and distress
43:20 -  how is your joy then how is your spirit then how are you abounding then have the prisoners hurt you or what are they hearing from you the same kind of gossip and glib things which they themselves speak or there's something being emitted from your heart and mouth that will turn the prisoners to
43:38 -  recognize that indeed there's a living God I tell you I have every confidence to meet every prisoner who shared those cells with Paul and Silas in eternity in heaven before God because the prisoners heard this
43:56 -  and it says suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed because God inhabits the praises of his people especially when that praise comes forth at the
44:12 -  time of greatest severity extremity and crisis and where God is there is liberty there's no place for anything being bound the prison doors burst open the shackles fell off the hands of Paul and immediately all the doors were open then everyone's bands were loosed
44:32 -  and the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep you want to hear what salvation is you want to hear the classic pattern of what of how a man genuinely should be saved and contrast this with our so-called evangelistic meetings where we're trying by every inducement
44:46 -  to get people to come up and accept the Lord there's Jesus waiting by the wings with his hat in his hand waiting to be graciously accepted that some guy might have a new buddy who can help him in the way that he wants to go here's the classic pattern of what true salvation means
45:03 -  it's not a cheap thing it's not tended cheaply and it's not received cheaply here was the keeper of the prison can you picture him what a picture of the world men trembling over their security wanting to get through school get by have you heard that expression
45:19 -  i think that we are hoist that up on our flag poles it's the national standards get by i just want to get by i just want to get my little split level home my little security my wife my kids my white picket fence get by have a little church or congregation get by the keeper of the prison
45:35 -  holding the keys trembling for his insecurity waiting to get his pension his retirement the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open see the world has got to see something from his people beside hear something drew out the sword and would have
45:52 -  killed himself supposing that the prisons had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harmful we're all here cool this guy take it easy we haven't beaten we're still here it doesn't matter to us whether we're inside the prison or out how come it doesn't matter Paul what
46:08 -  is this because to be free in christ is to be free indeed i tell you guys God means every word that he speaks and there's such a thing as being in christ that's a lot more than just spouting the conventional theology and church doctrines
46:30 -  it's a being in christ which makes you master over every circumstance i don't care what your situation is i don't care what your home life the condition of your parents the condition of your past the condition of your friends there's a triumph available to every believer over every
46:45 -  circumstance who lives the life truly in christ Paul says cool it guy we're not anxious to get out we're more free sitting in this dungeon than you are you keeper of the keys outside that's what it's all about and how is it that Paul saw this man ready to take his life
47:07 -  when he's in the dungeon and that guy's outside he sure didn't see it by the natural eye he saw it by the spirit by the gift of knowledge how many of you precious children who have had the baptism of the holy spirit have begun to operate in the gifts of the spirit i attended a pentecostal
47:25 -  church just a week or so ago and i was talking to the pastor in his office and i said pastor what do you see at the need of your church willard he said we're getting a lot of people in from the community who just like the church because they have no knowledge of the pentecostal dimension
47:37 -  and then we've got second generation young people who were born into pentecost who have never themselves really authentically experienced it and the older people sort of getting uh dim their vision is is dim we need he said the the gifts he said we need the exercise of the body gifts
47:52 -  and before i could catch myself no one heard leaked out of my mouth i said yeah i said we want the body gifts but we don't want the body life guys God hasn't given us gifts as little playthings that a little electric should be incorporated into our church services that would
48:09 -  say gee what a swinging church the gifts of God are given to set the captives free to bring sight to the blind to minister to a sick and to a dying world to minister to us when we're in a true body of believers with the masks off relating honestly to each other in the spirit i've seen the gift of
48:31 -  knowledge exercise over breakfast tables with spoons poised and ready to put the candle open your mouth and out comes a choice word of God by the gift of knowledge and wisdom to set someone a brother or a sister who's in a predicament to which human knowledge cannot answer
48:47 -  i tell you when we'll start to walk like that and believe God like that we're going to see the full dimension of the holy spirit which is something more than ra ra ra Paul told this man do yourself no harm we're all here and then he the prison keeper called for a
49:07 -  light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before all in silence and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved hallelujah what a glorious question you know i finally learned that as a teacher took me a long time to learn it i pounded my brains out i knocked myself out of
49:24 -  the history teacher i tried to do every cunning and clever thing i could think of to penetrate the indifference of my students and after some years of foolhardy activity like that i finally realized that no matter how good my answers were however clever my information and insight
49:40 -  if the students themselves did not ask the question it was all in vain what's the use of a good answer for someone who has not yet come to the question and i think our ministry in the world is to bring men to ask that one perfect question sir what must i do to be saved we're so good to
50:00 -  give them the answer that they can't possibly appreciate new understand not yet understanding their own condition and need when this prison keeper holding the keys saw two battered and bruised men inside more free and dungeons than he was outside them he came in trembling and fell
50:18 -  down before them and cried out whatever you guys got i want it what must i do to be saved and they said believe trust commit yourself to the lord Jesus christ now shall be saved in my house and they spoke unto him the word of lord then it's the time to speak with the lord
50:35 -  and to all that were in the house and he took them the same hour of the night and watched their stripes and was baptized he and all his immediately and when he had brought them into his house he said fool before them and rejoiced believing in God with all his house guys that was it that was
50:50 -  the beginning of the church of philipipe a woman saved by a riverside a prison keeper and that was the whole point of God by the operation of the spirit and by vision revelation bringing two jewish men to a greek city but you know because they were faithful a body of believers was born
51:11 -  by the blood which they shed by the suffering which they took upon themselves a church was born in a greek city antithetical to the spirit of God and later in the correspondence to the body of believers in those cities we have the precious letter to the philippians and there's a verse in
51:28 -  that letter that i want to end with today because you can see i'm a crackpot in the character already ask your prayer for me because one of the words that i'm not too fond about is christian i hope you understand that
51:44 -  because we jews that word has been so misused and so abused we think that the crusaders were christians who came to rape and loot and to victimize our communities in the middle ages we think that the that the inquisitor in the spanish inquisition when we were tortured on
52:00 -  iraq that those guys were christians we thought that hitler's germany was a christian country the word christian for us has fallen to low repute and when people say to me well what are you are you a hebrew christian you know i don't quite like that answer i like to say i'm a jewish believer
52:16 -  in the messiah Jesus and the God of Israel but there's a definition in philippians that i love most of all philippians three three it says we are the circumcision who rejoiced in christ Jesus who worshiped God in the spirit and have no confidence in the flesh
52:41 -  but who rejoices in christ peace and worship God in the spirit and is led by the spirit it's that company to whom God is speaking today and preparing us for a very heavy hour affliction that's going to come upon all this world purifying us and bringing jailers who are
53:01 -  sleeping everywhere and prisoners to the knowledge of Jesus christ that's my message i want you to bow your heads
