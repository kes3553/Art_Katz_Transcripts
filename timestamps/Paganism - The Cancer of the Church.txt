Paganism - The Cancer of the Church

00:00 -  My God in your heart and significant let it become that for us because of the power of your spirit and
00:09 -  Give us my God the ability to follow you to retain What you're speaking to assimilate to take it in to affect my God our conduct our walk our service We thank and give you praise for all of these days in this concluding day in Jesus. Holy name. Amen
00:25 -  Well, I was up to close midnight reading a number of things last night and reviewing and considering possibilities And then this morning my eye fell on the book by my chair And came a bit alive for me. I want to begin with that. It's the issue of paganism
00:43 -  not in other lands, but our own and Paganism not in other religions, but our own that is to say the growing threat of Paganism in contemporary Western Christendom
00:58 -  more in the liberal or mainline denominations than perhaps in the Wave that we represent but if it's not presently with us, it will be knocking an outdoor also Not announcing itself as paganism
01:16 -  But containing its essential elements that would contradict and bring the true faith down and
01:25 -  Lessen the reality of the church. So I just want to read a Book that contains Papers that were brought at a conference on the subject of church concern
01:41 -  Edited by Carl Broughton be our a double a ten who's a very well-known Lutheran theologian And in his introduction
01:55 -  He writes the so-called Christian nations of the West are in fact the new mission fields Which the churches cannot evangelize because they have not faced the renewed paganism that is the actual religion of those to whom the gospel Must dare be spoken but to whom the gospel has already been spoken
02:15 -  Or some form of the gospel has already been spoken are the people who at least suspect that That they are the candidates for paganism or that paganism is already insinuating itself and moving through Traditional
02:32 -  Christianity and threatening it. So there's a mission field right here about the purity of the faith For the authentic apostolic character of the faith He talks about a
02:47 -  conference of women in Minneapolis actually of witches Who prayed on this at their Sunday morning service to our maker Sophia?
02:58 -  We are women in your image with the hot blood of our wombs. We could form to new life and it goes on It sounds like pagan revelry and I'm very sensual. So the the element of sensuality
03:13 -  Sex is a predominant strand and theme in Pagan things and perhaps answers the question in part Why would people forsake or be indifferent or reject authentic faith in God to embrace something counterfeit?
03:27 -  Because it panders to the gratification of their more base lusts Which the true faith calls to be renounced or crucified those that have crucified the affections How does it say and the lusts?
03:42 -  Help me with this by the flesh and the flesh with the lust thereof. Those are the Lord's So the true faith calls for the crucifixion the false faiths provide gratification but they provide it in a way that's ostensibly seems religious and
03:58 -  God's celebrating and so that you have the best of all worlds you have a seeming spirituality while at the same time a justification for your lust and And
04:09 -  Broughton says whatever else is to be said of such quote worship unquote It is of course the opposite of biblical faith and amateurish But more
04:21 -  explicit reinvention of the fertility worship of ashteref and by and bail Against which the faith of Israel defined itself. So it sounds like it's an ages old battle and it's not over it's not just the curiosity of antiquity and
04:37 -  Canaanite religion that we can look on with a kind of disinterested interest. It's a vital Contemporary concern now and to the end of the age is the same vying for truth about God before men and the issue is life and death and the issues eternal salvation or eternal hell and
04:58 -  Time has not lessened the issue But in fact the end of the age will make it yet even more fierce and more difficult Because yet now more subtle
05:10 -  The ancient idolatries could be easily identified by the visible images of actual idols The contemporary paganism is more subtle. It doesn't have visible objects
05:24 -  Say it doesn't it may have and it has been released even among Christians when they have taken mementos or souvenirs off their walls masks that have come from Africa or other exotic looking objects that they think are quaint and
05:39 -  experience an actual Relief something lifts off and out when those things are taken away or destroyed because they contain the spirit valence of demonic powers culture is not neutral
05:53 -  There's a culture that has its origin from below and there's a divine culture and We need to be fearful and sensitive to the one and
06:04 -  willing and open for the other That's why Abraham had to come out of nation kindred and father's house lest he bring with him into the land of promise where the Lord would lead him any of the
06:20 -  valences and spirit dimensions of the Babylonian Thing from which he came out in order to call these it required a radical and surgical
06:33 -  Separation get the out You can't find the word as less uncompromising than the word out
06:42 -  Get the out what out of what those things that have the Greatest pull and soul bondedness that are familiar. Well, look what we're praying about with it with the
06:57 -  The hutterites these are things that are familiar and dear and hallowed by time and To let go of that. What did my mother say to virtually the day of her conversion?
07:09 -  I was born a Jew. I'll die. I'll die a Jew Was more important for her to retain the idolatry of Jewishness than to know God in truth, that's how powerful this these forces are
07:22 -  Because lest you missed the point or think that Abraham was made of better stuff than ourselves He never did get out right away When when Genesis 12 says so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken
07:35 -  You might think that God spoke Abraham acted But what happened between the initial speaking and Abraham acting is a long season of delay Where he leaves with his father?
07:46 -  he leaves with his mishpacha with his relative lot and his family and Instead of crossing the river goes alongside the river a little further south to another place called haram And there he remains and haram means delay and there he accumulated
08:05 -  Servants and possessions and evidently it was a delay of quite a lengthy time and what finally released him his father died So when his father died, he was released Maybe there's something of a companion piece to Isaiah 6 in the year that King
08:23 -  Died I saw also the Lord high and lifted up something had to go in order for that revelation Something had to die of soul-bondedness and attachment to release the prophet to it the more erstwhile and complete and total dedication for the purposes of God So the question for us is is there something waiting to die if we wait just for longevity to take its toll
08:43 -  Or can we bring something to a death that hinders a complete separation because we've not yet come out So the church would need needless to say is in a mixed bag condition He writes it was it was and his foolishness to the Greeks to believe that God would choose to embody himself in one
09:05 -  Individual human being it was and is an insult to human dignity and pride to teach that the word of salvation must come charismatically from the outside the proclamation of the body of truths that constitute salvation
09:21 -  So our salvation is predicated on a statement of God Of God rooted in history and event the birth of a single individual In an unusual way through divine
09:36 -  Conception and Called to be king and his very name means salvation is from God It wasn't an is an insult to human dignity part to teach that the word of salvation
09:50 -  Must come to us from the outside through a message that message the the foolishness of the gospel And that the objective saving history of God in Jesus Christ becomes gospel only through the apostolic proclamation the karygma This particularity
10:08 -  This insistence this message this man this name this birth this salvation is offensive to men They'd like to believe many paths to truth of course they never arrived there but it gives a certain aura of
10:24 -  spiritual concern and dignity but saves them from the actual discovery and communion with the God who is God and brings them into a relationship of Requirement according to his word. This is the way walking in it
10:41 -  so that's that's the Way the faithful always be at issue and why it's in contention still with
10:50 -  paganism and other alternatives So the issue of the faith is the issue of Christ the issue of Christ is called Christ ology
11:07 -  Any ology is the study of what the prefix is Biology is the study of life and you can think of other ologies theology is the study of God Christology is the study or the examination of Christ the centrality of Christ his person his office his history his proclamation his acts
11:28 -  The rejection of Christology is characteristic of the whole of present-day American theology. What a statement. What a sweeping statement Christianity basically amounts to religion and ethics in American theology This is he's quoting Dietrich Bonhoeffer who lived in America for a season of time
11:46 -  Studied or attended the Union Theological Seminary in New York And this is the observation of this keen German theologian about American Christianity The question is to what degree is it still true even 50 or years or more after that observation
12:02 -  That American Christianity is not insistent upon its dogma upon Christianity upon Christ ology upon its truths. It's more easy come easy go wishy-washy using right words and phrases, but not as
12:18 -  Insistent upon the dogmatic the content of the faith, which is the dogma D-O-G-M-A What's a definition for that? Because the insult that springs from that word is dogmatic
12:32 -  To be dogmatic. Well, you're narrow-minded. You're dogmatic. You're insisting on one statement. There are many ways of perceiving this Our faith is dogmatic and when we lose that connection We lose the faith even while we retain the words that pertain to it
12:48 -  we have lost its core and its reality and I before we leave this morning, I'm going to just read a few things of that
13:00 -  description in Germany The German faith was effectually lost and that and the first instances of that loss take place in the realm of theology And what takes place in the ivory tower and among?
13:13 -  Men who are at that level but it's not long before it filters down to the grassroots and affects the church itself So there's a flight away the search for the historical Christ
13:24 -  What are the then the new? Quest and the higher criticism where they were going to bring now to the Bible and a thorough Examination and not just by faith receive everything that said there
13:39 -  Incredulously, but see whether it passes the test of severe Scholarship and rigid examination of the kind that we would bring to other disciplines. Why not bring it to this? What is this so sacrosanct that it can't bear examination who says that it's all correct?
13:54 -  It might be scribal errors or worse and there were contradictions in Scripture it Sent it began a whole wave of things that led to the breakdown of the detriment of the most holy faith one rabbi
14:09 -  Said there are things that are not for us to examine. It's holy. Holy. Holy It's like man touching the ark to come to the things of God with the same irreverence by which he would come to Shakespeare or to
14:24 -  Theory of evolution You can't bring that kind of mentality to God he's not first of all he's not going to honor an investigation of himself in that spirit and he'll allow you to come to a
14:35 -  place of confusion and even of loss of faith and my thesis is that Nazism and the destruction of Western civilization think of if the Germans had won the war What what this world would be today?
14:50 -  even in their loss think of what was Devastated and destroyed not to speak of course of the six million Jews the whole eradication of European Jewry
15:04 -  because of the failure For Germany to maintain a viable Christian faith It had lost its apostolic if ever it knew it
15:15 -  Certainly by the time of the 20th century. It was so weak and so enfeebled. It had lost its dogmatic Character and The question is why?
15:27 -  Because the issue of Christology. What is Christ? What is the word? anointed King Jesus came preaching the gospel of the kingdom
15:38 -  Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand is it time now to restore the kingdom The whole issue of Christ as King Goes back to the first angelic pronouncement to Mary and you shall give birth to her son
15:51 -  His name shall be called Jesus and his father shall give to him the throne of David that he might rule over the house of Israel for ever You know that we have lost that connection
16:04 -  We ourselves the church even the charismatic or the New Testament forms have lost This root of the faith that Christ means anointed King that is a Kingdom at stake
16:19 -  Not just a religious alternative or the improvement of our life or salvation from eternal hell that the fundamental issue is King and One of the great scholarly breakthroughs in modern times is a book called Christ Christ Christus Victus
16:38 -  Christ the victor the triumph over the powers of the air came with with the crucifixion of this King Who defeated death by death and that this was the great thing that was apprehended and understood by the early church That they had obtained a victory over those things that had tyrannized mankind since time immemorial
16:58 -  The King had come and had broken into the powers of darkness in a way from which they would never recover and set in motion their ultimate defeat by the sacrifice of himself and that on the over his head in three languages Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews is not just an intended insult, but a more profound statement of this drama and the glory of it then
17:22 -  His malefact is new To lose this is to lose the faith now So why why has it been lost because it's the Kingdom of David because it's the Kingdom promised to Israel
17:34 -  Because it's has its inception in Israel because its rule in its law goes forth out of Zion and its word out of Jerusalem And the instinctive and intrinsic deep anti-jewish anti-semitic
17:48 -  Thing that is latent in Gentiles who are only thinly Christianized and not deeply converted shuns and dislikes and and wants to
18:00 -  Throw off these courts from us and have a kind of a Christianity amenable to our own culture our own Nationality and so on and that kind of Christianity must fail failed in Germany failed in Japan It will fail here unless we have resuscitated
18:16 -  The heart and the core of the matter the issue of Christ as King that's Christology King of what? the promise of God made to his father David of A kingdom to come to Israel, but not for its own enjoyment
18:30 -  But so as to bless all the families of the earth the issue of Israel's kingdom is the issue of the nations Coming under the sovereignty of God who established their number in terms of the sons of Israel There can be no real Christology he writes without the eschatological profit from Nazareth think of the stubborn
18:59 -  Specificity of God Not just a Christ you know why because these filthy pagan mongers and new-age characters use the word The Christ will come Christ has come Christ is Christ that
19:13 -  That everyone is Christ and the the gurus the men of wisdom are the Christ But the Jesus of Nazareth this Jewish kid Who was Bob Mitzvah not a thing he was?
19:26 -  Thoroughly Jewish son of David son of Abraham born in Nazareth Dwellton Nazareth born in Bethlehem Hebrew of the Hebrews or poor could make they claim what of Jesus this is the Messiah
19:39 -  to lose that that That stubborn and tenacious identification is to lose the ballgame is Jesus in Nazareth And what do we hear in white supremacist groups in America that call themselves Christians Jesus were not a Jew
19:52 -  They cannot bring themselves to that acknowledgement they they stumble over the stumbling stone in Zion I Want to frame a kind of Christianity with a Jesus who is not that Jew and not born in Nazareth Or somehow that's not the proof that did not come out of Nazareth
20:09 -  But what Jesus in fact them do they have? Though they use the word what Christ do they have Because if it's not the Christ who is king as the Jesus born in Nazareth
20:22 -  There's no salvation because that's what his name means yes you were Jehovah is the Savior and any other play on that name that points to another deity of our own composition and choosing though we use the name
20:38 -  leaves us without the benefit and the power of that salvation and When the false prophets of Baal were contending against Elijah and they made their own sacrifice and cut up their own ox They fully expected fire to fall
20:52 -  Because not only are they deceivers of men they are themselves deceived and deceived to believe that they somehow knew God they they called him Lord because the word was Baal and They danced and leaped and jumped and cut themselves and still there was no answer
21:06 -  Nor could there be an answer for there was no God that could conform to their expectation they were barking up the wrong tree It was a pagan Alternative to the God who was a lone God celebrated by the lonely
21:22 -  Prophet Elijah got the idea Men are going to be disappointed in the last days and that maybe they're disappointed now
21:31 -  Why doesn't God do this and how come he doesn't do that and I prayed it doesn't hear and that they're disappointed Look what's happening in Israel? The church is a mess
21:40 -  What's being disappointed is the human conception of a God of their own making who was an errand boy and Will play Kate and bring to them the kinds of things that they desired at their will as they pray But that God is not going to bring answer because he's not God at the very first miracle
21:57 -  At the gate beautiful was performed in the name of the child Jesus and Several times it comes up in the early apostolic Proclamation of the child Jesus that why are they celebrating the child?
22:10 -  He didn't die as a child But why did why do they keep making that reference maybe because the issue of child is the issue of birth as a son of David And that brings the vital linkage with the Christ who is Christ that God honors by the his presence and his power in the miracle
22:26 -  That's obtained so this needs to come back into our own consciousness Because to lose this is to lose everything as this writer says who is not himself Jewish There can be no real Christology or no real Christianity really without the eschatological
22:42 -  Prophet from Nazareth his own relationship to the Jewish people and to their God We can't get away from the stubborn thing of the Jewishness of the faith His teaching his miracles and his attitude to others cannot be understood except in this
22:57 -  Context that these things are embedded in the culture of ancient Greece and in their system of values Humanity is at the center man is the measure of all things What will we say the Christianity today?
23:09 -  Where the measure of all things is not the glory of God, but the benefit that accrues to man Don't don't Don't miss this
23:22 -  What would we say about Christianity today? I'll even go further of our best Christianity today of the most advanced and charismatic Christianity where man is the measure of all things rather than the glory of God and that the issue that underlies the whole
23:41 -  Premise of the church and its activity and function is what benefit accrues to men Has is that not the ultimate triumph of humanism that has come to the church? Is this not the deepest root of paganism that has effect affected the church and is its cancer and there's an only only one thing
24:00 -  That is powerful enough to count the man this incessant and intrinsic putting of ourselves at the center Which is the root of paganism and that is an abiding passion and jealousy for the glory of God and
24:15 -  What is Paul but the greatest exemplar of that glory as what the prophets before him? So that when Paul ends his great statement on the mystery of Israel in the church Romans 9 through 11 and with the great
24:28 -  blast of profuse Praise all the depth of the riches both at the wisdom and the knowledge of God who's been discounted For of him and through him through him are all things to whom be glory
24:40 -  forever the greater greatest issue for Paul was not Israel's restoration and It was not the church brought to its ultimate maturity and apostolic constituency that would affect it The greatest issue for Paul exceeded both Israel and the church. It was the glory of God for ever
24:59 -  and Paganism is a direct attack at that core and wanting to substitute for God's glory man's satisfaction religious satisfaction, but man's satisfaction
25:12 -  nevertheless And if we make that our conscious purpose We are already opening the door to these nefarious and paganistic influences
25:23 -  Is that to say that there's no benefit my God. I'm so benefit. I can't contain it, but we don't make the benefit The premise of the faith we don't make the benefit that accrues the first purpose We don't make the experience of what we enjoy the reason for our quest
25:40 -  That still is has man and his gratification at the center And it's a false center and opens the door the doors to that which brings down the faith as much as there is to love and admire in this vision of
25:55 -  Man at the center the concepts of beauty virtue truth justice Humanity and at an ideal levels it stands in polar opposition to the Hebrew Christian vision Rooted in the revelation of Israel's God
26:11 -  They're nice. They're humane. They're nice considerations And I want to Lord give me a grace to say this. Why am I an enemy of sentiment? Why do I blanch and cringe at people expressing sentiment for ostensibly nice things?
26:29 -  As I said to my dear wife last night Wanting to improve the plumbing in the house of someone in one of the villages in the West Bank is nice But there are considerations that are greater than nice, but they're but they're our
26:45 -  Warfare is not the evil Versus the perfect but the good versus the perfect the nice things the commendable things that the world and even the church Applauds and sanctions because it's shot through with human consideration and sentiment
27:04 -  The first thought that came to me when the Lord revealed himself in the first reading of the Gospel of John Abroad the deck of that tram steamer on my way to Athens Was what will your mother think about this?
27:16 -  How will this affect your mother the very first issue I had to face as a candidate for the faith was sentimental Loyalty or the truth of God and I shared with someone about the property here How we were gave up our interest in this camp. We were the founders
27:35 -  We're the first one the Lord spoke to me the vision for this place I then subsequently invited other brothers to participate not having the means myself And then there was a falling out over the issue of sin
27:46 -  And we had to make a decision has been Israel do we stand with the brother in? Loyalty and affection having a personal history with him over the years or do we stand with the issue of righteousness and those that are We're bringing judgment that this brother was seeking at that time
28:02 -  We thought to avoid we stood with what we thought was righteousness Cut ourselves off from the camp gave over our interest in the property stayed on our side of the road and lost everything In which we had invested finance money our life and our energy for another eight or ten years
28:17 -  We have this building now and this six acres only as a grace that has come back to us from God We gave it up for righteousness sake when we had to choose between sentiment and personal human loyalty and affection as over against an issue of
28:35 -  justice and righteousness for the church and for the kingdom so Watch the watch this deadly thing that continually sucks at us and nowhere more effectively than in the realm of our own children
28:49 -  Are you are you beating your children and knowing that it will not kill them? That's the word says beat them with rods It will not kill them
28:59 -  because if you hate their souls you'll abstain from bringing the kind of Discipline that they need that only you can perform and I'm persuaded that a lot of what we call Youth rebellion and
29:11 -  Turning away from parents and their culture what they represent is an unconscious expression and A cry for the failure of parents to show ultimate expression of love which can only be shown in chastisement
29:28 -  Because the word says so but what have we done we've put the word aside for sentiment and Tender feelings and humane things have taken higher priority a Book came to us some years ago in community on
29:44 -  Rearing children christianly and I gave it to a brother with a young child An erudite skilled brother in the word the book was perfectly biblical, and he gave it back to me to say it's too hard and
29:58 -  That's how the door is open Saints to the deterioration of the faith through Sentiments with deference to man and feelings not so much our children, but our own feelings Because we cannot bear the pain of inflicting pain and therefore we avoid it
30:13 -  But I'm very fond of quoting Shakespeare's Hamlet Where if you've not heard this before it's worth hearing and if you've not read the play I commend it one of the great
30:23 -  masterpieces of literature Where Hamlet learns that his father? Was murdered by his own brother and that his mother has married the murderer and
30:34 -  It breaks upon him through revelation. He cannot believe that he's astonished his father was a giant and this brother was a coarse vile philanderer and opportunist and got into the castle by marrying the wife of the man whom he killed and
30:49 -  So there's a scene in which Hamlet confronts his mother Gertrude And he grabs the locket from around her neck and opens it and in the locket is the picture of the deceased husband and of The present husband and he shoves it right into a face and he says something like you've chosen this bum
31:07 -  For the one who was a giant a man of stature and it breaks upon her soul She was deceived and seduced and it comes like a startling Realization of what she has done. He says you're lying betwixt incestuous sheets
31:23 -  And she cries out with a hot piercing cry that I'm sure everyone watching the play would just be muffling their tears Hamlet no more. I mean cool it back off. I can't take it the realization And Hamlet says this classic line sometimes one must be cruel in order to be kind
31:45 -  This is what what Paul was with Peter when Peter was compromising and doing one thing with the Jewish believers another thing with the Gentiles and Paul would not for an hour allow that the simulation for Bonavis was already being affected and the cancerous deception was already He had to stop it right now
32:02 -  Faith to his face not for an hour. Would he allow the thing to continue? It's going to take that kind of jealousy and that kind of insistence and this kind of even though your kids are howling or your mother Is howling you've got to stand for God?
32:17 -  Even if it's cruel and it will be considered cruel rather than humane But the kind of humanness that the world will celebrate and for which even Christians will applaud you is the opening of the door to the deception and to the loss of the faith which in the end affects entire nations and therefore in their wake is
32:39 -  Corruption and death Incalculable I don't have unless the Lord himself by his spirit underlines this in your heart Words will have to fail to communicate
32:49 -  What happens in the failure of the faith? And the lessening of the faith is not only the consequence to those who have allowed this erosion But what comes into the nation of which they are to be the statement and standard of God is so
33:06 -  Horrible that Well if we have not learned From a German in Japan we have not learned so in this last session that we have talked a little bit about Japan
33:17 -  I just want to say a few things about the collapse of the church and the world the faith in Germany And this is a classic study by a Jewish Historian at Columbia University
33:29 -  This was his PhD dissertation at Berkeley and I picked it up at the Cast Lake Library for five cents at a book sale Thank you Lord Providential day the politics of cultural despair a study in the rise of
33:44 -  Germanic ideology in which he shows that the greatest of the Ideologists those who shaped Nazi doctrine were almost invariably the dissolution the disappointed sons of Protestant ministers
33:57 -  Or out of pious Catholic families without exception They were all the victims of a failed Christianity questing and looking for some alternative to the God who had failed Very few historians secular historians ever take this perspective
34:13 -  They look at Nazism as the breakdown of the Weimar Republic and the failure of liberal institutions in a time of inflation the harsh requirement of the Versailles Treaty against Germany that made the nation a pauper nation et cetera and all those factors are true
34:28 -  But the sum total of them cannot give the deepest understanding of the rise of this demonic phenomenon The rise of this demonic phenomenon that led to the loss of European Jewry and almost to the collapse of Western civilization itself Let alone the cost and bringing that
34:44 -  demonic thing down At least the physical expression of it because as one has wisely said those spirits that came upon Germany Though that Germany was defeated in war the spirits remain and await their next opportunity
34:59 -  So if the conditions by which they had opportunity to come in and to penetrate and to pollute German Christianity and to leave an enormous void that even the sons of ministers were Disillusioned and without hope and without a deep engagement with God and looking for some kind of
35:19 -  Alternative and that what Hitler came upon the scene they they grabbed him as Messiah Fuhrer means leader and he was celebrated with as worshipful a Devotion as ever the church gave to Christ in the generations that preceded his
35:36 -  Hitler's coming So we need to gain just a few Insights out of that collapse and he talks that the book is about certain of the principal
35:47 -  Ideologists who fashioned the Nazi mindset Who cast their discontent into political visions which were as divorced from reality as their creators were from society And because of this learning they made the leap from cultural criticism to politics
36:05 -  Assuming that cultural evil could be dissolved by the establishment of the right kind of faith and community It's interesting that almost invariably they were looking for a kind of corporate life
36:17 -  There this there's a cry there's something in man that knows that To be isolated and to lack meaningful significant relationship is to become stultified and to die Germany has a much deeper sense of this than than we Americans were so individualistic
36:34 -  Because long before Hitler there were mature youth groups pioneers and
36:41 -  fireside singing and Looking back into German culture and even now closer to hit the time into pagan origins of Germany to find something that would bind
36:52 -  Them all together in the absence of God. They had to find an alternative That would be a basis for the kind of comradeship either word comrade was a fixed word in German vocabulary and even in Russian communist vocabulary
37:09 -  Seeking the same thing outside of God The failure of the church to be community and to meet the vital and organic need of men for authentic relationship as
37:22 -  comrades as brothers with shared destiny and significant purpose for being Was not provided by German Christianity and therefore the void was filled by its demonic alternative called Nazism The question is has that void been filled today?
37:37 -  Has that void been filled today? Our own Christianity is so totally individualistic Now again and again when I speak in Bible colleges and places like that
37:47 -  I say you guys who have the greatest prospect for community are not employing it You're just a bunch of individuals who of necessity are required to share the same facilities So that you can each be receive your your credential for your personal ministry, but you're not relating to each other's community
38:03 -  You're just using the same facility and what is a Sunday service, but they're coming together of isolated individualities for the purpose of a pain personal benefit listening to the man who's bringing it forth or the worship thing and
38:16 -  Leaving that to go back again into the privacy and isolation of their own homes We keep that up. Our kids are going to be looking for what is instinctively A need that God himself has created and they'll find it in ways that will more than embarrass us but bring us shame
38:33 -  It's interesting that the two guys that blew up that school in Colorado and those kids were neo-nazis They idolized Hitler. They wore trench coats. They had military gob. They fantasized They wanted something heroic even if it meant their own death let alone the death of others
38:49 -  And the parents were absolutely a star stunned and their children could be capable of this kind of bloodletting without conscience Right in an American normative court Christian home
39:00 -  Because the question is how Christian was the Christian if it is not vital in Meeting man and the deepest engagement that he has being made in God's image because God himself is a sweet company He's not a solo deity
39:17 -  He's a father and a son in the Holy Spirit and they are in a market remarkable relationship together One without the other is inconceivable to themselves One be first to the other they enjoy their fellowship
39:31 -  The Sun was a delight to the father long before he ever made his appearance on the earth And we're called to demonstrate the mystery of the Godhead that when we will be one as they are one the world will know that The father has sent him. There's a father who sends there's a Holy Spirit who testifies
39:49 -  The three this is not my phrase with the God I had coined that I would have retired God himself is a sweet company So what I'm saying is only that Christianity which is apostolic that Christianity Which is the dogmatic faith of a Christ born at Nazareth?
40:06 -  Called to be king and a kingdom that he is already advancing by his coming that will come to Israel and benefit all nations This is the faith and we don't apprehend the faith that way and lay hold of it because it has expectancy for a future There's a hope with that we have part in that kingdom
40:22 -  We shall rule and reign within in that kingdom this life whatever its difficulties is preparation and discipline for that rule If we lose that we lose the incentive for this life and we have no hope for the life to come And therefore we while were we yet Christians were copping up. We're fornicating. We're taking liberties. We're reading pornography
40:41 -  We're slipping a bottle Whatever form it takes. It's the evidence that we have not been fully engaged in God. We've lost the Jewish Kingdom route
40:56 -  So they sought to destroy the present in order to usher in a future Reich Reich you know this German word What does it mean?
41:04 -  third right the driven life like his kingdom They did not know or they rejected the kingdom of God Which is the kingdom of Israel because they were too damn proud to allow Jews to have such a promise for their future
41:21 -  And so they found their own German alternative a king a third life a kingdom, but it was a kingdom of death Praise God that the Lord did not allow it to succeed Or I cannot even speak of the misery that would have been projected over all mankind
41:38 -  We would be having Auschwitz's in Minneapolis We have death camps throughout America We would be systematically annihilating American Jews as they systematically annihilated them in Europe
41:50 -  And in fact, it's this very spirit that will seek again that annihilation At the end of the age and in the time of Jacob's trouble, and I think it was John Weren't we together in Auschwitz and Birkenau? Yeah as we're walking
42:03 -  Huh Was it Simon we were walking over these vast ruins of the barracks where these
42:11 -  Skeletons were contained and it's it's breathtaking in the wrong way to see German What's the word?
42:19 -  Efficiency and order set up as a process of annihilation only the Germans could have killed and annihilated six million in the short period of Anyone else would have made a mess of it just a logistical problem of killing and annihilating was itself staggering and
42:35 -  Simon said art of you believe that the time of Jacob's trouble correct me if I'm misstating this Is going to exceed the horror of the Nazi time and that it will be greater in its magnitude and there'll be more Life lives lost. How could that take place in the short three and a half year period that we expect it to be?
42:53 -  Except that there be camps of this kind set up elsewhere in the world wherever centers of Jewish population are Wow, I never thought of that Yes, I was expecting great attrition Jews not being knocked off here and there
43:08 -  But that's true if we're talking about the decimation of 10 million Jews that cannot be obtained in three and a half years except through some systematic system To autology
43:20 -  of annihilation and Not in Germany Lord and they will be there again but in our nation and in other nations that have allowed the same spirit that came into Germany that come to come into us and
43:34 -  For the same reason that we have not a formidable and apostolic reality in the church that could identify And resist it, but we have a lesser kind of self-seeking experience
43:46 -  Disoriented Christianity that does not fit us for the onrush of these last-day evils and we will collapse before it. I Have never taken the time when the Lord has never Called it that we should speak. So as we are now in these days
44:00 -  all has never Called it that we should speak. So as we are now in these days all of the subjects what that we
44:09 -  Pro that we could have had for this prophetic school. What was the Lord's insistence the nation's the powers Christ the powers? And the nation's this is the last day's drama and the the Nazi thing and the Japanese collapse was a preview That we must not miss for in it of all the lessons for ourselves
44:27 -  Somehow the union of this insistence on the authentic dogmas of the faith but in the Spirit and the apostolic and the prophetic spirit even in the Hebraic spirit would save it from becoming a kind of an arid and
44:41 -  offensive I know the truth and you don't kind of mentality. You don't say anyone's saying there's something about a fundamentalist that is icky and offensive but the truth of fundamentalism is
44:53 -  Critical but how to hold that truth and how to demonstrate that truth By the spirit and in community in the reality of that faith is the issue Maybe the problem with the fundamentalist of Germany took house wherever they were
45:06 -  Was that they lacked a corresponding reality to their life and was satisfied only with creedal correctness And had not the accompanying Existential reality well we're reading about these ideologues who were starved for a reality that was not to be made that was not available
45:22 -  To them even through fundamentalists he or let alone through the liberals that whatever was Christian had was failed so They could not realize on this earth some of the bliss that had once been promised for the hereafter
45:38 -  There was no sense of a future or an eternal reward Worth waiting for us for seeking they were artists without talents of creative expressions prophets without a God This is a Jewish historian writing this
45:53 -  Having a Jewish religious faith that is to having discounted and thrown it over they could not fall back on the promise of divine deliverance What why do men entrust their destiny to a Fuhrer a guy with a little mustache who's not even German but Austrian and a failed artist and just
46:11 -  Out of the punk elements of German society from the bottom that meet in beautiful basements How could a great nation of good or should affect the eagle and trust their destiny to a questionable character like that? Because they were desperate and because nothing else had been provided them as alternative and as model
46:29 -  They had nothing to fall back on in the promise of divine deliverance and therefore they had to seize a human or a demonic Alternative having abjured a given of a reason they could not expect the natural Human evolution toward the community they sought
46:44 -  The goal consequently was a mystique and the means to the means the left obscure Suggested violence and coercion This you're not going to get this just hearing this
46:56 -  The end of it is violence it's looking for something as God cannot provide it man cannot provide it and so they take the demonic alternative, but the but in the end it requires somehow the expression of the employment of violence God's way is peace, but the way that seems right into a man is death and
47:19 -  Description was so these men who have become a complex instance of the search for salvation Who has ever examined Nazism as somehow a failed search for salvation? That these men could not find salvation within the context of the nation of the Reformation
47:38 -  Has got to be one of the astounding Statements of modern times that has never ever fingered in examining the phenomenon of Nazism Hitler Germany the Holocaust That the root of it is spiritual
47:52 -  That the root of it is a failed salvation and a God that could not be experienced or a faith that would be Experienced as community and that these women deeply questing for something of this kind and therefore they found it in the place That Satan had prepared
48:14 -  The compromise of German Christianity the loss of its apostolic character The making of it a religion that was amenable to German national purposes and imperialism or business is exactly
48:28 -  What the Jews did with their Judaism in Germany reformed Judaism's the forfeiting of the supernatural content of the faith a domestication of
48:39 -  Jewish faith to make it amenable to Business and cultural pursuit that would make them a companion to their Christian Compatriots in Germany both the German and the Jew were guilty of the actual
48:56 -  Renunciation of God and the turning of the true faith toward their own personal Purposes, it's a paganism even in the name of God, which is the worst offense to God It's interesting that the the Jewish patrons of the arts and of intellect very much encouraged these directions in German Christianity
49:17 -  They were the first ones to recognize and to aid a German young theologian who subsequently became the father of German Theology whose name is Shlaya Macher. He was first discovered and helped by Jewish patrons Who recognized him as an innovative German thinker?
49:35 -  But what was his innovation away from the dogmatic? Faith and its insistence on a Jesus and a Christ and into a faith experience obtained as
49:47 -  Experience that did not require this narrow dogmatic insistence and therefore was amenable and available to middle-class Germans who wanted some spirituality without the loss of their lifestyles. It was a perfect Provision for Germans who wanted to accommodate the Christian faith to their lifestyles that could not have had
50:08 -  Lifestyles like that if Christ is Christ because the true faith requires discipleship The truth faith requires sacrifice the true faith requires the putting of the interest of God before oneself but this was a people who wanted success in business the world of commerce trade culture and
50:26 -  Imperious expansion colonialism and that they want a religion that would lend itself to that and not that would threaten that So isn't it ironic that the monster raised up by Jewish? Participation and encouragement came back in the end to bite them the Frankenstein that they created destroyed them
50:45 -  because the Germany that grew up in the loss of its dogmatic faith and Retained only the husk was able to put them through concentration camps and gas ovens without the blinking of an eyelash and without any recognition that what they were destroying were the
51:01 -  Descendants of the ancient faith of the God of Israel, which was their faith. You understand what I mean? So they they gave rise to that which subsequently killed them the loss of an authentic German Christianity was the undoing of the Jews as it was almost the undoing of the civilized world and
51:18 -  Jewish participation and encouraging that Christianity away from dogmatic insistence to a more naturalistic religion that would make it more amenable and not narrow and threatening to Jews actually became the death which is they did not recognize that a true
51:37 -  Christianity would have been their salvation Because they had not seen the true Christianity all they had seen was a stunted kind that was for them anti-semitic So it's a it's a deep tragedy
51:49 -  The greatest fear is the rise of Christian fundamentalism and the insistence on the narrowness of this gospel Which means that they themselves must subscribe to it to be saved Well, they don't want to be saved by it. They want to retain Jewish life Jewish institutions Jewish religion Jewish culture
52:05 -  They don't become Christians They don't be threatened that this is the only alternative a model way when there are many past pluralistic ways the truth So again, we have history repeating itself
52:15 -  They are in the forefront in their powerful places of influence to come against the very faith that needs to be established in its dogmatic Insistence that this is the way walking in it and there's no other name given in heaven and earth whereby men may be saved And not only are they involved in the ACLU in places like that
52:32 -  But in the places of TV movies culture books articles where without actually and expressly and explicitly Stating these things the whole tenor of it is to come against fundamentalist religious
52:46 -  Conviction and to hold it in division or bring it into question as being somehow narrow Well, what's happened in our culture? The worst thing you could be called is to be called dogmatic Well, if Jesus came full of grace and truth and we come full of truth with white doctrine and dogma
53:05 -  But without grace It's a painful contradiction Because it is the truth all the more does it require a grace amenable and comparable and equal to that truth
53:15 -  That means that our character and our life is as important as the body of convictions that we carry and Communicate if we just have the one without the other we're either empty bags or we have a right content But not a right person so they've we've got to become the thing in itself
53:31 -  That's what Jesus was in that way and that what we are called to be otherwise, we're just fundamentalists with the right Monarch of the right categories, but not the right life. You shall be a witness unto me Not just the correct purveyor of the dogma
53:45 -  That's a much greater requirement than just being correct and I'm saying we cannot obtain that and be that Independent of church as community we cannot come to that fullness in reality as isolated individuals However, well-meaning we need the grace the grace is perfected and
54:01 -  Inculcated in our life in the dealings and requirements that come in those that are living together sincerely So my God Steal the church
54:12 -  Where humanism has pervaded it where experience is more important than dogma and dogma is even an offense and the whole ecumenicism that is taking place now charismatically and
54:26 -  Institutionally is to put dogmatic Doctrinal differences aside in the name of unity and agreement Which a sentimental humanism pervading the church that will be its end and because they think that what they wrote that that represents progress
54:41 -  And the reconciliation of mankind at last that we who insist on our narrow dogma are more than a fly in the ointment We are a dangerous and dangerous impediment to the very progress of mankind Which is now within our grasp if you would not be so stubborn in your insistence on this dogma this faith this word
54:58 -  And we just put aside those petty Distinctions and go along that we might be have unity Build a tower higher than God
55:09 -  so my God Alert the church wake it up shake it out my God History is knocking at the door. It's haunting us. We can't sweep it under the carpet. Look what it has cost my God
55:20 -  Will Germany ever recover unless there are wholesale repentance of the failure of their Christianity before God? Which still exists and nothing has been altered even since the Holocaust still man-serving
55:34 -  Man pleasing So Lord Restore the faith that is the faith we pray for it's the only alternative to darkness and to death
55:44 -  Whatever it costs us to be the promulgators of that faith the oracles bearing the oracular message of God and that's some light equivalent That makes us fascinating that people should run after us whatever it requires look to bring your oracular voice to the church into the nation We welcome it. We thank you for the privilege of that call may we die my God in it whether we succeed or not
56:06 -  rather than lapsing my God into The alternatives we thank and give you praise in Yeshua's name
