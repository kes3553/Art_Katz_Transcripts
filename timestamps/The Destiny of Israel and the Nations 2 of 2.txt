The Destiny of Israel and the Nations 2 of 2

00:00 -  So, I'm even pleading with you to receive the literal intent of what Isaiah is saying and to believe for that despite every appearance to the contrary. Islam is running wild.
00:20 -  Iraq is a disaster. Israel is scheduled for collapse. The causes of evil and darkness seem to be overflowing the earth.
00:31 -  Thick darkness and gloom is pervading the earth. It looks like the cause of God is lost in the overwhelming flood of darkness and evil that prevails everywhere.
00:45 -  You should have seen the movies that I had to see on these Cafe Pacific flights. If I don't see it on my own screen, you can't help but see them. Every movie is vile, filthy, lewd, unabashed, sexual, open display.
01:08 -  It's evil. It's an evil world, saints. And it's going to get worse.
01:14 -  Evil will increase. How then shall God succeed? How then shall there be righteousness in the earth?
01:24 -  How shall his rule go forth to the nations who are still in an attitude of rebellion against him? So that in Acts 17, Paul says to the Athenian philosophers,
01:37 -  God has appointed a day in which he will judge the world by that man whom he has raised from the dead. Because by one blood, he has established all the nations
01:51 -  and given them their bounds and habitations that they might seek after God if happily they might be found of him. Not only for their salvation, but to find out what was the purpose of God
02:04 -  in establishing Malaysia. What was the purpose for Germany, for the United States, for England? Was it empire?
02:13 -  Rural power? Wealth? That has brought into our generation two world wars and threatens a third?
02:22 -  And the ambition of nations in their rivalry, one with another? God, Paul says, God has winked in times past, but he commands all men everywhere now to repent.
02:36 -  Because they have not considered that their nations are not a playground for their ambition nor lust, but that there's a divine design for the nations centering in their relationship with a restored Israel
02:51 -  by which peace and righteousness shall dwell in the earth. Lord, open our minds, our hearts. Give us a conceptual breadth of what the drama is in which the church is placed.
03:11 -  It's not just getting to heaven, being saved, enjoying services. There's a context of a remarkable kind that has to do with your glory and your kingdom, which is your rule over and through all the nations who are in a state of rebellion to this day
03:33 -  from the day they sought to build a tower higher than the heavens, Chapter 11 of Genesis. What happens in Chapter 12 of Genesis? And God said to Abram, get thee out of thy nation, thy kindred and thy father's house,
03:52 -  and follow me in the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation. And they that bless you will be blessed, and they that curse you will be cursed.
04:03 -  God's answer to the rebellion of the nations is Abraham and the nation that is to issue from him Israel in the place that God intended for its habitation,
04:16 -  which is not today the present state of Israel. But the day will come when they will be uprooted, sifted, and the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion
04:31 -  with mourning and sighing fleeing away, Isaiah 35, I think Isaiah 51 also, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads.
04:43 -  Now, you dear Chinese Malaysian saints, everlasting joy, because they will not again be rooted up or yanked out,
04:56 -  they will not again know terror and fear, for I will plant them, and the tabernacle of David,
05:06 -  which has been torn down, shall be restored, and all the nations that call upon my name will come under its authority, Amos chapter 9.
05:21 -  The tabernacle of David is the same as the holy hill of Zion. It's the rule of God over Edom and all nations. So is the Lord ruling over you?
05:36 -  Who told you to go into that business? The hope for profit? You calculated in your Chinese way?
05:44 -  The pluses and the minuses and came to a conclusion? Or did you seek the Lord? Did you find His will?
05:53 -  Who said you should go to university? Was that just the logic of middle class society? Maybe the Lord wanted you to be in garbage removal.
06:04 -  Maybe He had some other program for the preparation of your character and life, but you did not think to consult Him?
06:14 -  Your government was not upon His shoulder, and your lack of peace is the evidence, for of the increase of His peace,
06:24 -  there shall be no end. He's got to rule over His church, and He's got to rule over Israel
06:33 -  before He rules over the nations. So that they'll study war no more. Can you imagine what that will mean in terms of wealth
06:46 -  that is now expended on death and designs of the armaments industry and unbelievable billions
06:59 -  in which nations must arm themselves, must have the hardware, the airplanes, the technology that its neighbors have,
07:11 -  if not so much for their defense than for their pride, expending billions while great segments of mankind
07:21 -  face the problem of malnutrition and starvation. Do you guys know that one third of all Israel is living beneath the poverty level?
07:33 -  That two thirds of its children are inadequately nourished? That Israel, with the United States,
07:42 -  has the highest discrepancy between the very rich and the very poor? How is that a righteous nation?
07:52 -  Ruled by ambition, lust, and power. In today's Wall Street Journal that I picked up in Hong Kong,
08:01 -  the only English newspaper. My Chinese is very poor. I can hardly read the menu.
08:10 -  It said in an article on wealth in America that has recently been established by a comprehensive study that one percent of the top people of wealth in America
08:24 -  govern ten percent, one third of the entire nation's wealth. The second nine percent
08:36 -  govern the other third of the nation's wealth. That means that ten percent of the American population prevail over two thirds of the nation's total wealth.
08:50 -  And the same ratio exists in Israel itself. But when the righteous judge comes, he will bring equity and righteousness and peace
09:04 -  and settle the dispute between nations and the have and the have nots. We just got a mailing from a ministry in Asia.
09:15 -  And it showed a picture of a boy with a tumor hanging off of his face that he could barely open his mouth and open the eye.
09:25 -  The whole face that is enclosed in a growth by which he's virtually starving to death. And he's lived with it since youth.
09:34 -  And he's now in his teen years. And it requires an operation that his poverty can in no way provide.
09:45 -  Oh, you dear saints, there are inequities, injustices, unrighteousness, suffering, ignorance, disease.
09:57 -  While some are living in so sensual a total gratification in wealth and prestige, two thirds of mankind is languishing
10:09 -  for the most elementary things to have to do with the dignity of the humanity who are made in God's image.
10:22 -  Why are you saying all this art? Because I want to prick you and stir you to cry out, Lord, thy kingdom come.
10:35 -  Your righteousness pervade the earth. The world is wicked and evil. Government is a miscarriage.
10:46 -  Men are stuffing their pockets and using their political opportunities for their own self-aggrandizement.
10:53 -  There's a whole fraternity of people who are in with the leaders, with the rulers in high places. But the world needs justice,
11:08 -  righteousness with a king who has come. Listen, you dear saints, if you do not understand the place of Israel
11:23 -  in returning to Zion with everlasting joy on their heads, why? Not only because they're saved from any future expulsion,
11:33 -  but because they have been exalted and having been debased to the place of prominence as the place out of which God's rule and law
11:45 -  goes forth to the nations. They are chosen and honored, and the nations come up to Jerusalem
11:54 -  on the feast of tabernacles to celebrate the God who has restored and given a place of honor to a nation totally undeserving
12:05 -  because he is who he is. And the nations that begrudge Israel their new and celebrated status and will not come,
12:15 -  upon them God says, I will curse them and remove their reign. So I'm trying to paint with the broadest brush
12:26 -  what the issue of Israel actually is, who themselves said, we will not have this man to rule over us.
12:37 -  We have no king but Caesar. What has that cost the chosen people to deny their king?
12:47 -  And do you guys know that when you say Jesus Christ, you're not pronouncing a proper name?
12:57 -  That the word Christ is not Jesus' last name? It's his title? The word Christ and Christos
13:05 -  is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word Mashiach, Messiah, and that word means anointed king.
13:17 -  And we have so degenerated in our faith that we have made the two words a catch name, as if Christ is his last name.
13:28 -  No wonder we Jews have been left in such ignorance when we heard you say Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
13:34 -  We don't know of any Jew who's named that. Had you said Yeshua, Mashiach,
13:42 -  Jesus the Messiah, the Christ, we might have looked up and asked you a question. But you were too dumb to tell us
13:50 -  and didn't know yourself. Because you're not conscious of the Lord as king even as you sing about it.
13:59 -  And if he will not be king over his own people, of whom then shall he be king and rule? At your own leisure,
14:12 -  read Deuteronomy 32.8. I'll read it for you now. A little snatch, a cryptic reference
14:21 -  that I've never heard anyone ever preach on in verse 8 of chapter 32 of Deuteronomy. When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
14:32 -  notice the subject, the nations, does that include Malaysia? Yes.
14:39 -  When he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children
14:48 -  or the sons of Israel. Deuteronomy 32.8, where Moses is telling us
14:56 -  from the beginning in the divine intention of God, when he established the nations by number,
15:05 -  he did so in proportion to the number of the sons of Israel. That from the beginning there always was a linkage between the nations and this nation.
15:18 -  And there will never be peace on the earth until the nations themselves will submit to that divine ordering.
15:27 -  But I don't know how Malaysia is going to like it. That it has to go to Jerusalem to honor Israel's God?
15:37 -  What's wrong with Allah? You got the idea? God has chosen a nation
15:47 -  that is despised in order to reveal the deep, stubborn arrogance and pride
15:55 -  to be found in all Gentile nations who will not submit to the principle of God's authority and rule
16:04 -  in establishing that nation as central to all nations. And you need to see Israel in that context.
16:13 -  Because if you don't, you're seeing Israel only sentimentally or out of a sense of guilt.
16:22 -  And you'll miss the apostolic and prophetic context that makes your faith the faith. I wrote a little something before I left for the trip
16:35 -  as my physical condition improved. And I was able to read and write. I composed a little something,
16:43 -  I want to share it in conclusion, entitled Israel and the Apocalypse, a hermeneutical key for all the faith.
16:52 -  Hermeneutical means a key of interpretation. If you could hear tonight, the references that I'm making
17:01 -  have to do with Scripture, have to do with covenant, have to do with what is written,
17:07 -  has to do with God, His character, His nature, His grace. To exalt a nation and give it a place of prominence above all nations,
17:18 -  though it does not deserve it, shows that the issue is not the qualification of nations or men, but the issue of the character of God,
17:29 -  who will elect whom He will elect, have mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and exalt whom He will exalt.
17:35 -  That's why I'm here, you dear saints. Did you think it's because I have two university degrees? Or three or four?
17:44 -  I'm here as a piece of foolishness and dust that God last week took out of a hospital to set before you,
17:53 -  not because I'm qualified in any human way, but because I'm the very piece of the mystery of what He's going to do with all Israel,
18:03 -  choosing the foolish and the weak thing to confound those things that purport to be wise. Because that's part of the mystery of the conflict
18:16 -  between the powers of darkness and light that God's wisdom and way, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,
18:25 -  He will perfect praise to confound the powers of darkness who rule in the heavenly places
18:32 -  and say power, violence, force, prestige, wealth, this is where the action is. There's a mystery, dear saints,
18:41 -  in Israel's restoration through the Church. Talk about choosing the foolish thing. Israel will be completely out of it,
18:55 -  however impressed you presently are with Israel's ability and expertise and you secretly admire
19:04 -  and wouldn't mind being a Jew yourself. They are not going to succeed on the basis of their human ability.
19:15 -  They will succeed on the basis of the God who raises the dead. And will not Himself pronounce it.
19:25 -  He will not Himself address the dry bones, but He'll speak to a Son of Man and command Him to prophesy
19:34 -  that those bones can live. That's you. You better be able in that day
19:41 -  because if your prophesying is only wishful thinking, I hope, I hope, if you have no prophetic character,
19:50 -  if you have not been shaped at the hand of God in the school of the prophets, which is a suffering,
19:57 -  you'll have no authority to address those bones. You won't even have an inclination to address those bones.
20:03 -  You'll not even be able to be commanded to address those bones because you're not one that is subject
20:08 -  to the commands of God. You'd rather go independent, do your own thing,
20:13 -  and hope that He comes behind you to sanction and approve your choice and your decision.
20:19 -  I'm pleading for Israel's survival and restoration with the Church of Malaysia tonight.
20:27 -  Why us? Because if God cannot obtain it through you, impressive as you are,
20:36 -  with whom then and with what church anywhere will He succeed in the fulfillment of His mystery? If you will not come to prophetic stature,
20:46 -  if you cannot be commanded, if you cannot speak in resurrection authority, if you have not the faith to believe
20:53 -  that those bones can live, how then shall Israel bless all the families of the earth
21:02 -  and fulfill its Abrahamic calling? How shall it be life and the dead if you can't revive it?
21:12 -  So you're Chinese, all too Chinese, Malaysian, all too Malaysian, human, all too human,
21:18 -  charismatic, all too charismatic. You need to rise to apostolic and prophetic stature,
21:26 -  comprehension, character, and, excuse my language, corporality. Who?
21:36 -  That you come collectively and corporately into the statue of the fullness of Christ as a man.
21:48 -  That means death to your Chinese self-centeredness, privacy, distance, separation.
22:00 -  You've got to move from your culture, powerful, though Christian, into the transcendent apostolic reality
22:10 -  that the church knew at the first, where no man thought that the thing which he had was his own and those who believed were together,
22:19 -  which is a lot more than just sitting alongside each other. You've got a challenge to break the pallor of your Chinese, excuse my liberty,
22:31 -  of your culture, deep, which the church has not in any way identified or critiqued or condemned.
22:43 -  It's allowed you to enjoy a measure of it and be as Christian also. So what are you saying, Art?
22:51 -  Something transcendent must take place in the church of all nations by which they transcend the limitation of their culture
23:04 -  that keeps them from the apostolic and prophetic stature that is the key to Israel's deliverance. And you know what?
23:14 -  You'll not let go of that without some suffering, without some dying. I just had a little intense conversation with my wife
23:23 -  before leaving. Don't you want to see your grandsons before they go? Well, I just saw them the other day.
23:32 -  What is it with you? What kind of a man are you? Where's your sense of family and kin? Because my wife is Danish.
23:44 -  And do they have a sense of family? Those pagans, they walk around the Christmas tree singing choruses to whom they don't even know.
23:56 -  Their culture is so much to do with flesh and blood, family, kin. What kind of man are you?
24:07 -  I said, well, I'm a Levite. And when we were called who's on the Lord's side, Moses said, put your sword on your side
24:23 -  and go in and out of the camp and let every man slay his friend, his brother, and his neighbor. God says, in that day, the Levites were consecrated unto me.
24:35 -  The word consecration means hands full of blood, not the blood of strangers and personal people that we can slay for celebrating the golden calf,
24:46 -  but our neighbor, our friend, our family. I try to tell my dear Danish wife, I'm separated from these blood and flesh ties.
25:01 -  That doesn't mean I'm indifferent or unaffected or unconcerned, but the foremost and singular consideration, the purposes of God.
25:12 -  Okay, can you take just a few minutes more? This little paper, I'll just try and sum it up. Israel and the Apocalypse are hermeneutical key for all the faith.
25:22 -  Because if you misread Israel, if you have only a shallow, sentimental, and human disposition and affection for that people
25:34 -  because they're cute or you admire them or you have a romantic view of them from the Scripture, you will have missed the issue entirely.
25:47 -  To sentimentalize Israel is to sentimentalize God. And I'm a ruthless Levite whose sword is out against sentiment.
26:01 -  Sentiment is false pseudo-love. True love chastises. True love judges.
26:12 -  True love is the expression of the wrath of God against evil, which the Church celebrates in the book of Revelation, that your power has come,
26:22 -  for you have displayed your wrath against evil in judgment. Israel is in process of being judged for its horrific sins,
26:38 -  even the sin of the crucifixion of its own Messiah, Lord and God. But Arthur, that was 2,000 years ago, how can you hold present Jews responsible
26:51 -  for the execution of their Messiah, done generations before they were even born? Because it says in Zechariah that in that day,
27:02 -  when the Lord comes to fight against the nations that seek to destroy Jerusalem, they shall see me whom they have pierced
27:13 -  and mourn for him as one mourns for one's only son and be in bitterness for his firstborn. God is saying that generation of Jews
27:22 -  who shall see me when I come to deliver them shall see my scars and know it is he whom they have pierced. That God holds present Jews as being identified
27:37 -  in an unbroken continuum with the sins of their fathers so long as they continue to hold Jesus in disrespect and rejection.
27:47 -  That's why when they break and mourn every man and every family apart, husbands and wives will not be able to mourn
27:59 -  together in the same room in the same house. So deep will be the contrition and remorse when we shall see him whom we have pierced.
28:11 -  You need to understand these things. It'll put grit in you and iron in your soul. Because the issue of God's apocalyptic judgments,
28:22 -  so prominent in the finale of the age, provide a principle of interpretation, a prism of seeing, of refracting light.
28:33 -  It brings an urgency of what is real, primary, ultimate, a virtual counteraction against last day's deception, the sense of reality itself.
28:43 -  I'm reading that. It'll be on the tape. You can consider it. It's when you consider Israel apocalyptically,
28:51 -  when you see in her expulsion and flight and the destruction of two-thirds of its people and only the survival of the remnant,
29:01 -  the severity of God's judgment, understand for the first time also the extent of his mercy. For to exclude judgment from God is to exclude God as God.
29:17 -  There's something about considering Israel rightly that even saves us from the deceptions of the last days. I don't know how to tell you that.
29:27 -  It's because I subscribe so fully to the judgment spoken of for Israel's future and recognize it in Israel's past. It insulates me from being a soft sap
29:40 -  in kinds of things that would influence me soulishly. When you bite the bullet of God's judgment, it insulates you against soulish disposition and consideration,
29:54 -  which is the foundation of last day's deception. Only Israel will provide that if Israel is rightly understood apocalyptically.
30:06 -  That is to say, in the context of the judgments of the last days. It has to do with reality itself because if we are off base with regard to Israel
30:20 -  and our affection is only shallow and sentimental and personal and self-serving, excuse my language, symbiotic by which we derive a certain kind of enjoyment
30:33 -  and satisfaction for our attitude toward Israel. It gives us a sense of spiritual lift or exaltation and we're losing the value of God's intention.
30:48 -  And if we're off base there, we'll be off base elsewhere. We'll be celebrating our kin, our flesh, our grandchildren and giving them an undue attention that borders on idolatry
31:02 -  and rods God of the full devotion and worship that is exclusively His. So the failure to consider Israel in this way, even by well-meaning Christians,
31:14 -  who prefer to see the present state succeed because they are more concerned for success than they offer the glory of God,
31:25 -  has condemned the church to unreality, immaturity. It has depleted eternity because it absolves us from the participation
31:36 -  in God's conclusion for that nation in the last days where the issue of righteousness is the issue of eternal reward. As Jesus tells us in Matthew 25 when he says to those who call him Lord,
31:50 -  Well, if you call me Lord, what did you do for the least of these, my brethren? But Lord, when did we see you naked, thirsty and hungry in prison? As you did not do this for the least of these, my brethren,
32:05 -  you did not do it unto me. And you're cast out from the Kingdom into an eternal fire of shame
32:16 -  for having missed the crisis moment where the others who said Lord did extend mercy. And God says to them,
32:25 -  Enter the Kingdom prepared for you, righteous. Matthew 25. Listen, dear saints,
32:35 -  the issue of Israel in the last days is the issue of the church. To be righteous toward Israel and extend mercy when they're globally hated,
32:47 -  and you place your body in protection of theirs and suffer that likelihood, that peril, that's righteousness.
32:58 -  Righteousness is sacrifice in behalf of another regardless of the consequence to oneself because it knows that in making that sacrifice and saving that soul,
33:11 -  the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion. And with their return comes their King who shall rule over them and through them to all nations.
33:24 -  I'll tell you what, don't think that you're going to find a righteousness of that ultimate kind in the last day
33:33 -  if you are not consistently growing in the righteousness of God in the present day. It's the last day that determines how we live the present day.
33:45 -  So don't you make any little Chinese bargains and contracts and cutting corners and a few other irregularities and get by with it.
33:57 -  You need to be jealous and zealous over integrity, over righteousness, over truth, or you'll miss the Lord in that last day.
34:10 -  It's the awareness of the conclusion that disposes us now to live rightly. So to be taken up with this
34:24 -  and the basic conflicts and struggles establishes moral existence itself. And this would be my last statement and my fanciest.
34:36 -  There's something about the reality of Israel when it is prophetically considered in the context of apocalyptic judgment
34:48 -  by which the Lord chastises a nation in order to break it, in order to fit it to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world.
35:00 -  That brings in the whole issue of what is moral. This deserves a whole other speaking in itself. But it brings a focus of reality,
35:15 -  of issues of right, of what is the faith, how do we understand God,
35:22 -  what is our relationship, what are the subtlety of our idolatries, culturally, personally, historically, racially.
35:34 -  These are moral questions. And I'm saying in conclusion, the issue of Israel, rightly considered,
35:44 -  is the restoration of a moral perspective, of a sense of what is moral, which is at the heart of righteousness,
35:56 -  which the Church does not exhibit and embrace consciously. It comes with a proper recognition
36:06 -  of the subject of Israel in the context of its coming apocalyptic judgments. When you will love the judgments of God,
36:18 -  you will love God. But if you resent the judgments and think he's going too far
36:24 -  and is being too severe, you're not in the proper place of knowledge, worship, and adoration.
36:33 -  To love God is to love his judgments, for when his judgments are in the earth, the world will learn righteousness.
36:43 -  Lord, I have never before spoken without shoes on and my shirt sticking out. First time.
36:56 -  And I would go even further and be more foolish than this if by such a means you might succeed the more
37:05 -  in penetrating through that subtle tissue of culture and charismatica and whatever it is that keeps the Church
37:16 -  from the profound recognition of the last days, the significance of Israel in it,
37:25 -  and the place which it alone plays in that nation's restoration, when it will itself have come
37:33 -  to the status of sons and daughters of the resurrection who can be commanded to prophesy.
37:45 -  So Lord, I'm praying for this congregation precious, blessed, rich, visible investment through your servants to this people
37:56 -  over a length of time. But there's a call tonight for which everything till now was preparation.
38:05 -  They need to come through and into a greater and final and ultimate dimension that for the want of a better word
38:14 -  is called apostolic and prophetic. And it centers in the recognition of the issue of Israel,
38:23 -  the Holy Hill of Zion, the rule of God from the appointed place which He has chosen
38:29 -  and the people whom He has chosen, totally undeserving and disqualified, except for His grace.
38:38 -  Lord, bless this Church, my God. However much I have foolishly played with them over the issue of being Chinese,
38:48 -  to whatever degree, that's true. And they need to see it and deal with it and break those ancestral and deep things
38:56 -  that keep them in the realm of soul and sentiment rather than the role and place of spirit that recognizes judgment and celebrates it.
39:06 -  Give them that grace, Lord. Because if you'll not do it with a congregation like this
39:12 -  in East Malaysia, where then can we hope for it anywhere in the world?
39:19 -  That the issue tonight was so great, so significant, it was worth everything to take a man
39:24 -  out of a hospital where the doctors had failed with their intravenous and antibiotics
39:30 -  and in two days to raise him up and allow him to travel for two days to get to this place
39:38 -  with over 26 hours in planes like once, but so great are the stakes. And if it doesn't come by the hearing of the word
39:47 -  prophetically proclaimed, how then shall it come? So Lord, I'm thanking you for the tape tonight.
39:57 -  Put a seal on it. We've prayed even before in Minnesota that you would not allow any warp in communication
40:04 -  and that these saints will hear again. You can't get this in one hearing. They'll consider again the text that had been cited.
40:12 -  They'll discuss it among themselves. They'll recognize how insidious and subtle a thing sentimentality is
40:21 -  because the world applauds it and it's nice. But it's contrary to God
40:28 -  and it's going to take a ruthless and stubborn campaign against it that is jealous for truth and righteousness
40:40 -  and will take the sword against substitute, sentimentality, shallow affection, that symbiotic relationship with Israel
40:51 -  which we enjoy and does something for us but nothing for them. We will only benefit them
40:59 -  as the sons and daughters of resurrection and nothing else and nothing less. So Lord, bring that sentiment to death
41:08 -  that resurrection may have the greatest sway. And your Lordship which we celebrate and call you King
41:16 -  needs to be earnestly considered where we have acted unilaterally making our own decisions based on logic,
41:25 -  weighing up the pros and cons and seeing what is the benefit rather than saying, Lord,
41:31 -  what would you have for me to do? And I'm praying, Lord, that the government of this church will be upon your shoulder.
41:45 -  I bless them, Lord, and as your Jewish representative and they have appealed that I should
41:53 -  receive their plea for forgiveness for the abuse that has come upon the nation Israel and the Jews, I extend
42:02 -  so much as it pleases you and so much as I'm qualified that forgiveness.
42:08 -  I bless them, Lord, and if they have elabored under any kind of curse for being part of a nation
42:15 -  that has so spoken against your people, your Abrahamic people of whom you said in the beginning,
42:22 -  and I'll curse them who curse thee, I lift that curse. I lift the curse from this nation.
42:28 -  You're already preparing places of refuge in the jungles of Malaysia for Jews who will be sifted through,
42:35 -  God knows, from the same countries that are represented here tonight in Australia, United States and other places,
42:42 -  for you will disperse them over the earth and they will find you in a Malaysian jungle when they look into the faces of Chinese believers
42:52 -  and see the unconditional love of God who can bear their unkind in-spirited rejection
42:59 -  without wincing, without needing to be gratified, without needing to be applauded
43:05 -  because it's not sentiment that rules them but the divine love that is unconditional
43:11 -  and makes no requirements. Lord, bring us to that. Thank you for the Word.
43:19 -  Seal it. Let it perform its work. Thank you for tonight, my God.
43:25 -  Thank you for giving us strength to carry on like this and for the capacity you've given the people to follow. Thank you, Lord.
43:34 -  This was an insertion of the kind for which we have been praying that we go into the foundations
43:41 -  of this church, of this nation and have consequence both for time and eternity
43:47 -  for we ask it and we receive it with gratitude in Jesus' name
43:53 -  Amen. Amen.
