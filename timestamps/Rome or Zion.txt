Rome or Zion

00:00 -  I'm sure that I'm the most conclusive evidence of Colin's naivety to invite me to be a speaker. Surely he should have known better. It shows he hasn't been around too much, but the Lord has prevailed and used our brother's innocence
00:25 -  to bring a speaker who's not always welcomed. So I receive this as coming from the Lord and believe that he wants me to say something and I've been rooting over it now for several days and through the day.
00:47 -  I've very much appreciated our brother Bob yesterday commending to us that we should all publish our biographies. And I have. Thirty years ago, this was the journal of my conversion,
01:03 -  the story of a Jewish atheist looking for philosophical answers to his distraught life, taking a year's leave of absence from the teaching profession with a pack on my back, a hippie with long hair, but an unkempt soul and kept keeping a journal of my experience.
01:21 -  So if you want to see how God apprehends a radical and atheistic Jew, this is the classic statement. It's all the more remarkable because it's not a book written in retrospect where someone looks back. This is the actual journal kept by an atheist in the process of being apprehended by God,
01:40 -  including the revelation that came to me in the first reading of a New Testament aboard the deck of a tramp steamer on my way from Italy to Greece. You've got to know that Greece was more significant for me at that time than Israel
01:55 -  because I was more a Greek than I was a Hebrew. I celebrated man and man has his center and esteem in all that has issued out of Greek civilization. In fact, in my classroom in Oakland, California, I had a big sign over the blackboard,
02:12 -  Go Greek. So the God who has been amused by me and has waited brought me to be the Hebrew of his intention in Jerusalem at the end of that journey.
02:25 -  And I've been serving the Lord for these last 37 years, saved because of the prayer of one of my students and her mother who had never laid eyes on my face. So I'm a privileged man and the Lord has been pleased to issue a number of books.
02:46 -  Some of you may not know this. Others have been blessed by it. Reality, it's also a book that goes back for a couple of decades. People tell me they read it annually and it deserves to be read annually.
02:58 -  You'll find some episodes out of our community life of northern Minnesota. For example, having to slay a pig and a lamb side by side was one of the most instructive experiences in my life
03:11 -  of how it is that the lamb died silently and how it is that the pig died with such groans and creaks and howls and shrieks as I did not know flesh was capable. I never gave an invitation after that as I had given them before
03:28 -  and was never persuaded that a believer is really responding until I hear his flesh screech and howl as much as I did the pig that day. So there are numbers of God's people who have never been that deeply converted
03:42 -  and God's yet waiting to hear their screech and howl. It might come today. But if it doesn't come, here's a little booklet on the nature of true conversion spoken in California where the congregation went down on its face
03:56 -  and I knew this is a word that needs to be recorded because when they rose they were not again the same. All of these books, by the way, are in several languages and I have not lifted my little pinky to promote any. It would be a great tragedy if I have to schlep back in the suitcase the same books that I brought at great strain
04:16 -  knowing the potential to touch lives and to bring a dimension that is not to be found in most charismatic publications. This is a more recent one, The Spirit of Prophecy. We have a website with an entire book called The Prophetic Call
04:31 -  in which I draw from my over 30-year experience in that calling and someone, a brother, said, Art, the need is so urgent now with the celebration of prophets to have a true word on what a prophet is that you must put something in print now.
04:45 -  And so this is the 50-page extract of that something in print on the subject of prophets for which we are getting very great response in many places. More recently, Apostolic Foundations.
05:00 -  You'll notice if you've ever heard me or have occasionally heard me more than once the two words that come up most frequently in what I have to say are the words apostolic and prophetic. When I speak them I drool.
05:14 -  There's a little saliva that comes down the corners of my mouth and chin because I recognize that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And if these words lose their meaning and we become undiscerning
05:29 -  and become an easy mark for anything that is called either apostolic and prophetic and is not, the church is for that reason doomed. So I have been jealously investing myself in what the meaning of these two great words is
05:44 -  and this book is devoted to an examination of the word apostolic, apostolic character. I appreciate what our brother had to say who preceded me about character. I was almost ready to run up on the platform and hug him.
05:56 -  By the way, I'm not worthy to untie the shoes of such a gentleman or any of the other men who have preceded me who have a long, much longer history in God and more significant service.
06:10 -  I'm amazed to find myself on the same platform. But this book, apostolic character, apostolic perception, apostolic proclamation, apostolic view of eternity, the principalities and powers of the air,
06:25 -  foundational concepts that have been lost to the church in modern times and need to be restored if we are to be the thing for which God has called us. And not last, and I'll be speaking from it, so I've kept it for last,
06:45 -  though it's an earlier book called The Spirit of Truth. The church is the ground and pillar of truth. If it forgets that or has never known it or does not treat truth
06:58 -  with the kind of deep respect, reverence and love that it deserves, the church is a Ghana. It becomes a kind of wishy-washy, sentimental, easy-go-easy-come-easy-go
07:11 -  kind of collection of saints that have no real significance. And I believe it's not an exaggeration to say that every horror that is being perpetrated in our modern society can ultimately be laid at the door of the church
07:25 -  for not maintaining the standard of truth, for not being God's plumb line. So there are very few who are able to read this through, but if you can and will, I assure you, you'll be different at the end of it
07:39 -  than you were at the beginning. It's a very requiring book, as you'll hear now as I hope to speak something from it. I don't usually write out my prayers,
07:57 -  but this afternoon or this morning, I can't remember when, I wrote out the prayer that I'm now going to pray. So I just ask you to join me with your spirit,
08:12 -  because I'm asking the Lord to use this speaking to discombobulate the foe, the cosmic alignment of powers over this city and the nations and those especially that have great sway in all the institutions
08:29 -  that affect the life of men through falsehood, through lying deceptions, that corrupt their values, rob them of eternal reward and honor and the honor and glory of eternity itself.
08:40 -  And in the institutions, may you Lord especially penetrate and bring into disarray those powers that prevail, but through cunning and deceit in the most powerful of all institutions,
08:55 -  namely religion. So let your word, my God, constitute an event in this speaking that expresses your apostolic and high priestly heart,
09:08 -  a word that is appointed and on time, that has to do with your glory, your power that raised Jesus from the dead and enabled him to ascend on high
09:20 -  for your eternal glory, praise and honor. In Yeshua's holy name I pray, Amen. And so I had thought also today of a cloud of invisible witnesses.
09:32 -  You see how we apostolically minded men think? We take into consideration those things that are either unknown or too readily dismissed by most Christians, namely,
09:42 -  and I'm believing, that there's a cloud of invisible witnesses over this convocation even now. And what constitutes this cloud?
09:52 -  I'm praying that every soul who has groaned, travailed, wept, has been stretched out before God in an anguish of soul for the purposes of God
10:02 -  as it pertains to this city and has gone on before me and has gone on to be with the Lord will constitute through his selection a cloud of invisible witnesses over us now.
10:15 -  I've been praying for intercessors. You see, if your word is more than an amusement, if you're trusting that it's a word of event that's on time
10:24 -  and that God has provided a platform for its urgency, then you yourself travail for the travailers. You know that such a word has got to be birthed more than it is proclaimed.
10:35 -  And unless there's an anguish of prayer, of groaning and travail that cannot be uttered, such an event cannot take place. So I've been naming the intercessors I know
10:46 -  and trusting, Lord, to stir others in this nation and elsewhere for this very speaking, and that that cloud of invisible witnesses in which I trust my Jewish mother is present,
10:57 -  having been saved in the last week of her 95th year before her death, is also looking down with approval upon her Jewish son who is no longer considered to be an enemy,
11:10 -  but one in whom she can have a rightful pride that he's serving the God of our fathers. Well, I've been around over 37 years
11:28 -  and have been once a charismatic darling of a Jewish kind on Catherine Kuhlman's programs, full gospel circulation, many, many kinds of doors that have now since been closed,
11:40 -  and the Lord brought me to an obscure place in northern Minnesota, and for many years people who had known of me thought that I was dead. And they were not far wrong, because it was to a death
11:52 -  to which the Lord brought me that I am immensely grateful, and all that I see and understand and express now all over the world. I'll be going in a few days from this trip
12:03 -  to Southeast Asia for six weeks, the Philippines of which my brother spoke for 12 days, Japan, Singapore, Australia of which he spoke, New Zealand.
12:12 -  I've just come back from Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Holland, Germany. There's no end of travel,
12:21 -  because a woman prayed for the teacher of her daughter, who came home from school every afternoon weeping for this arrogant Jewish atheist that he might be saved.
12:35 -  So I'll tell you what my perspective is. It's been an ache now for a number of years. There's a great corrective that is needed by the Church,
12:46 -  all the more by those segments of the Church that are most applauded, where we think that we have it all together, and have the chutzpah, you know that word?
12:57 -  The presumption to think that we have a full gospel. And that corrective is the fact that distinguishes the Church as the Church, because it pertains not to the needs of men,
13:16 -  either their healing so much or even yet their salvation, however rightly desired these things should be, but it pertains to the glory of God realized in the coming of the King
13:27 -  and his theocratic kingdom, which is the consummation of all the ages in these final and consummating last days.
13:38 -  Am I glad this is recorded? You'll need to hear that. That's a mouthful. What I'm saying is that a Church that is not preoccupied with the glory of God
13:50 -  as its central and foremost consideration, or has substituted the needs of men, however valid those needs are,
13:58 -  is no longer the Church that can be called apostolic. It's a Church that can be called a culture or an institution, or that accommodates and sees to the needs of men,
14:09 -  but it has lost its central pivot, the preoccupation, the jealous guarding of that which pertains to the glory of God. And the glory of God is going to be realized in the coming of his kingdom.
14:25 -  And, well, we know so little about that, and we have been so persuaded that the kingdom of God is within, that we think of it almost exclusively as something personal, internal, subjective, interior.
14:41 -  But I want to commend to you the kingdom of God in its most awesome respect, of which we have lost note, namely as a ruling entity over the nations. There's a God who's actually going to rule out of Zion.
14:58 -  There's going to be a law that will go forth out of a literal and geographic Zion, so that men will not study war no more and beat their swords into plowshares. And nations will come up to the God of Jacob
15:14 -  in the place where he will have established his sanctuary, his dwelling, and the locus of his theocratic rule. A restored Israel.
15:24 -  Not the Israel of today that you're so fond to applaud and to take interest, but a people who will come out from that present people in a final and searing last day's time of tribulation,
15:40 -  out of which only a surviving remnant will return to Zion. And in that return, and in that Zion, our God will rule. That you don't know this has great consequence for the Church,
15:57 -  because this should be central to our every perspective, our every preoccupation with the faith, what it means. I can tell you as a charismatic or former charismatic
16:08 -  who had a wonderful bag of rich things from God, the Holy Spirit, government, church, the Word of God, that when the Lord inserted the critical key of an apostolic and prophetic perception of the centrality of Israel
16:25 -  as being significant and foremost in the Church's own consideration, all of these separate and isolated good things given of God came together in a new coherence that made the faith the faith.
16:39 -  I'm praying that God will insert that key for you, either because of the speaking or the provocation of the speaking that will compel you to do your homework and search the Scriptures
16:49 -  and find that which has been lost and needs to be restored, the centrality of Israel. That God has not forsaken His people,
16:59 -  that His promises and His covenant intent will yet be fulfilled, or how shall He then be God? And probably the greatest presumption of the Church
17:11 -  is its triumphalist assumption that it now is the Israel of God and that this ancient and original people have missed it and lost it and have no place of return or restoration in God's purposes.
17:26 -  That has been so tragic an error as actually to disfigure the Church and to render the Church, what shall I say, something much less an other than the glory and power
17:37 -  and significance of God's intention. The issue of Israel is central for the Church's own recognition of itself as the Church, as much as the awareness of what is female or feminine
17:50 -  and woman is central to a man's own perception of himself as a male. To remove this aspect from our consideration is to leave us lopsided and out of joint and subject therefore to every whim, every passing fad,
18:05 -  every kind of thing that's going to alleviate our grayness, going to fill the void that we sense and need with some panacea, some thing that's current which only in time will fade
18:17 -  and in fact which perhaps the entire charismatic movement has been an expression and in time is fading. We must restore the thing that God Himself intends that is central to ourselves
18:33 -  not because Israel deserves that consideration but because God has spoken, because God has promised, because God is the God of covenant and will keep it even when His own people will not
18:45 -  because His mercy is greater than His judgment. So there's a glory of God because that kingdom is the kingdom of David. It must be established from the throne of David in Zion.
18:59 -  And these are not mystical, romantic allusions, these are concrete and specific indications of the embarrassing specificity of God of a people and a place that must be the seat and locus of His rule over creation.
19:18 -  That we are not jealous for that rule is an embarrassment to the Church and I trust that our governments, our human governments, however much we may hope in them will invariably show their inadequacy
19:33 -  until when we say come Lord Jesus, we're not praying for escape, we're praying for righteousness to come into the earth through the rule of God from the place which He has designated and which will not be obtained
19:45 -  except through the good office of the Church to the Jews of this last day who will be a saved remnant. Through the grace and mercy which you will express to them
19:56 -  and in so expressing will yourself be transformed. Oh the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. My heart goes out to you dear ones, especially the Catholic charismatic dear ones
20:10 -  who I'm sure don't understand a word of what I'm saying and I'm some kind of conundrum or strange phenomenon that will soon enough pass. I tell you dear saints, every word is a thunderclap,
20:23 -  every word is a statement of searing truth and if you're having a difficulty in understanding me it's not because I'm wanting inability from God to express
20:34 -  but you have been so long neglected, so long disabused, so long kept from any awareness of the apostolic and prophetic dimensions of the faith that what I'm saying sounds to you as a strange gospel.
20:52 -  So the crucial axis, the nub of the consummation of that kingdom is the millennial reign of Christ on the throne of David through a redeemed Israel obtained in a final time of cataclysmic judgment
21:09 -  called the time of Jacob's trouble and the return from the nations wherein they are yet to be scattered including this nation.
21:19 -  So I'm putting you on alert that we are in northern Minnesota for 25 years because of an obedience to the same voice that called me by name in Jerusalem and told me when I stepped over a chain on a property that was for sale being bankrupt
21:34 -  where we presently are, end time teaching center, community refuge. The Lord kept the word refuge on the shelf until the season of death in that community of about 15 years ago in which the Lord sent me to a Lutheran seminary
21:52 -  to make that death real and in that course of time and in that season of death the Lord began to reveal to me the mystery of Israel.
22:01 -  I want to tell you dear saints that there's a world of difference from a condescending patronizing of present Israel and a kind of a sentimental desire for their success
22:12 -  as against a recognition of the Israel yet to be established from the ruins of that present state and the cataclysmic judgment which is yet to come on Jews worldwide.
22:24 -  It's almost a getting off the hook for us. It's almost a cheapie to have a mere mild sentimental concern and a desire for their success
22:33 -  rather than the radical requirement that would come for us if we recognize the Israel that is yet to be redeemed because it will be redeemed through the mercy that will be extended to it
22:44 -  by the church itself in all nations in which that people is yet to be scattered. If God is going to establish a place of refuge in northern Minnesota in that nation which Jews have enjoyed the greatest success and freedom, prosperity
23:03 -  what shall we hope for in any nation in this time of Jacob's trouble in which God says in Amos chapter 9 I will sift you through all nations
23:14 -  and where we're told in Revelation chapter 12 that when that woman flees that there's a place prepared for her in the wilderness
23:24 -  where she will be fed for three and a half years. If that place is not prepared, if there's no feeding both spiritually and physically there will not be a surviving remnant that will come in its return to Zion
23:37 -  with everlasting joy upon its head and mourning and sighing, fleeing away. You see my predicament? In one hour I'm required to make up for the omission of ages
23:50 -  and therefore I'm required necessarily to speak to you in mysteries and send out these stabbing statements that require remarkable amounts of elaboration
24:01 -  which I'm not in a position for the shortness of time to give you which is to say there's a great premium right now upon your own spirituality upon just how filled with the spirit you are
24:14 -  just how much is the spirit the cogent factor of your life that you can even discern between the lines the things that I'm not enabled to say for the want of time
24:25 -  and that these remarks come into your spirit with an impact of a kind that will require great alignment and adjustment because the issue is the life and death of the people
24:39 -  and the establishment of the kingdom through their returning remnant upon whose head will be an everlasting joy after mourning and sighing has fled away. So this is accomplished through a self-sacrificing church
24:57 -  that demonstrates the very mercy of its God and it takes place before the face of all nations so much that as to their acknowledgement
25:06 -  that the God of Israel, the God of Jacob, the creator of the heavens and the earth is a lone God to the eternal praise of his glory. The issue of Israel is the issue of God.
25:17 -  Not only the issue of the church, the issue of the nations. The nations have given scant consideration to our God. He's only a contending deity among the whole bewildering array.
25:31 -  The God of Jacob is a lone God and the demonstration of his mercy to Jacob after that of his judgment will persuade the world that he alone is God
25:40 -  for they will witness both the expulsion and the return of his own people through their very nations where God says I will not do this in the corner but before the face of all nations.
25:51 -  If this is the final and great concluding episode of the ages for which everything till now has been preparation and it's about to break as we can see from the tumult
26:02 -  and chagrin of the conditions in Israel in so great a security, an insecurity that a recent poll in Israel had determined
26:11 -  that 60 to 70% of present Israelis believe that they are without hope and they're right in that belief, humanly speaking. God has engineered and brought together circumstances
26:23 -  that will bring about such a cataclysmic devastation in that land and an expulsion again into the nations which gives us our opportunity to be to the least of his brethren
26:34 -  that for which he waits. And I can tell you that it's not going to be an easy requirement. So to speak of the church of the 21st century
26:51 -  almost makes me either to smile wistfully or to cry because it implies that we have a century ahead. And what is God going to do in the next century?
27:01 -  What ought we now to consider? Well, I don't think we have a century ahead. I think this is the last days.
27:07 -  We are at the end of the age. This is the consummation. We're coming to a conclusion, an antichrist time
27:13 -  of great severity, challenge, and devastation not only upon Israel but upon the saints. To talk about a 21st century
27:21 -  gives us a kind of security and sense that this is the best of all worlds. And if it's not, it can be made better. And what program or what ought we to do
27:29 -  in conditions which we think will always prevail? What we lack and what was the distinctive of the first church and needs to be restored and has been lost in exact proportion
27:39 -  as we have lost the significance of Israel is the eschatological and apocalyptic content of the faith which the first church knew who awaited the Lord's appearing
27:51 -  and gave to the church a sense of urgency, a dynamic of great and high seriousness, all together the antithesis of the likeness
28:00 -  that has characterized our charismatic doings. I'm sorry for the fancy words. Eschatological means things pertaining to the end.
28:10 -  Apocalyptic means it will not come without judgment, violence, and the devastation that God Himself brings in His righteousness.
28:21 -  To not have these components as vital center in our Christianity disfigures our Christianity and relegates it to the kind of harmless and innocuous culture
28:32 -  by which the world knows us. The issue of Israel is the issue of the church, but it's the issue of Israel rightly understood,
28:40 -  rightly apprehended, and not sentimentally dismissed. You can know that you have it when it costs you something. The turning point for the church will be the discovery of Israel
28:52 -  in the sense that I'm describing not in the condescension of acknowledgement of the present state and its success for which we all hope,
29:00 -  but in the sense of the mystery central to God's redemptive glory and theocratic intention. A merely benign and sanctimonious approval of present Israel
29:11 -  in no way threatens our petty kingdoms and leaves them quite intact. The revelation of a redeemed nation
29:18 -  resurrected out of the death of the present one shatters all our petty kingdoms, all our categories, and requires and makes necessary anew
29:28 -  the review of our understanding even of God as God. Will he go that far to bring again a devastation upon world Jewry
29:39 -  that will exceed the Nazi holocaust? Well, if we read Jesus rightly in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, the answer is yes.
29:48 -  He will go that far. That there's yet a future catastrophe that will eclipse the Nazi time,
29:55 -  and the church sitting on the very threshold of this soon-to-break phenomenon has not the slightest awareness of its coming
30:03 -  and has made no preparation either physically or spiritually to anticipate it. You see why we need the Holy Spirit?
30:13 -  To bring a perception of reality and of understanding that has been so lost to us that cannot even be humanly communicated,
30:21 -  and that even Paul speaks of it as mystery. And he said, I would, that you would not be ignorant of this mystery, brethren,
30:30 -  lest you become wise in your own conceit. It's the only mystery of which Paul was Stuart in which he gave such a warning.
30:41 -  We might miss some of the other mysteries, but if we miss this mystery, there's a consequence that is fateful for the church.
30:48 -  Namely, it will become wise in its own conceit, pompous, inflated. It will become the Israel of God.
30:56 -  It will bring the kingdom of God. It is the kingdom of God, the kingdom now. It's going to change society.
31:02 -  It's going to do this. It's going to do that. The fact of the matter is
31:07 -  that God has called the church to a humbling and secondary role. We're not first fiddle, we're second fiddle.
31:14 -  We're called as a proviso to bring back to Himself a people who were broken off of the tree
31:22 -  into which we have been grafted. Paul says in Romans 11, have they stumbled that they should fall?
31:28 -  God forbid that you should think that, that God has permanently disallowed them. But through their fall,
31:33 -  salvation has come to the goyim, to the Gentiles, so as to move them to jealousy.
31:41 -  There's a purpose for your salvation beyond you. And I don't know, have you noticed? What, are we one or two speakers short
31:48 -  of the conclusion of this conference? I have yet to hear any speaker, with the exception of one,
31:54 -  make any allusion to Israel at all. That omission is more significant than you can know.
32:02 -  It has more to say about our condition than we can know. And I have the privilege of seeking,
32:10 -  in the short time I have, to bring a correction to it. So when we consider Israel rightly,
32:20 -  we have to consider the God of judgment. We have to consider apocalyptic devastation. We have to consider
32:27 -  people being dispelled again into nations in an exile and a return. We have to consider suffering
32:37 -  and its significance. We have to consider the meaning of the cross. We have to consider
32:43 -  the suffering that precedes the glory, not only for Jesus, but for that nation called
32:49 -  in Exodus, I think, chapter 4 or 3, my firstborn son. And that that son that has a destiny
32:56 -  somewhat comparable to its pattern, son and messiah, must in great measure also follow him
33:03 -  in a road to Calvary. Look at present Israel. Look at its arrogance.
33:09 -  Look at its bumptious conduct. Look at its disregard for the opinion of the world. Look at the violence to which they have been compelled.
33:17 -  Look at every loss of every moral and ethical dimension in which we Jews once posted,
33:24 -  now going down the drain of the kind of ruthless conduct that's required for our very survival.
33:30 -  Is that a people who can bless all the families of the earth? Or is God forgetting His promise to Abraham?
33:37 -  Or will it require a transformation of such a kind from the present character of that nation,
33:43 -  revealing its humanity and what God has always said is the human condition and which we would never recognize
33:49 -  that there's no man good, no not one. To be a people who will bless all the families of the earth,
33:55 -  not impress them, bless them, because the very character of that nation has been transformed,
34:01 -  having been required through suffering and apocalyptic last days judgments to pass both through death and resurrection.
34:08 -  And unless there's a people in the earth, a company of sons, a son of man company,
34:15 -  who can prophesy to those bones that they can live, they'll remain a dry heap
34:21 -  and will not bless the families of the earth, for their restoration, their redemption out of death,
34:28 -  their resurrection, waits upon a people whom God can command to prophesy to those bones
34:34 -  that they might live. God forbid in that day that that prophecy is in any way reminiscent
34:40 -  of the multitudes of prophecies that we have heard in our charismatic experience that have left us with no more than a yawn.
34:50 -  That should have been rebuked had there been pastors who were more jealous for the honor and glory of God
34:57 -  than the disturbance of their congregations and of the status quo. We've had so much dubious,
35:04 -  carnal expression of so-called supposed gifts that I trust in that one historic moment that will come when God calls us
35:12 -  to address those bones, that the prophecy that comes forth out of us then will itself be an authentic resurrection phenomenon
35:20 -  by a people who have themselves passed through death or they'll not be able to raise the nation. You see how imperative the whole issue of spirit is?
35:28 -  For what is spirit other than the issue of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead?
35:36 -  What we have in portion, and as a token, is the glory of that power and that reality.
35:43 -  For us to treat it lightly, mock it, make it a kind of an accompaniment to our present institutions
35:49 -  to improve them or to renew them is to do despite to the great intent of God
35:55 -  through the giving of the spirit of His life. There needs to be a charismatic repentance to commence the 21st century,
36:05 -  however short-lived that century will be before the coming of the Lord. Also, there are many scandals that have followed
36:14 -  in the absence of the realities that I'm describing in the sentimental dismissal of Israel that serves our purpose
36:22 -  and allows us to pinch their cheeks and plant the tree, but leaves our effectual lives
36:27 -  unhindered and unrequired of. You can know that you have apprehended the issue of Israel rightly
36:35 -  when it jostles and requires a complete realignment of your entire understanding
36:40 -  and the forsaking and the foregoing of your own petty kingdoms. For the issue of Israel
36:45 -  is the issue of the kingdom of God, if you could but know it. So we have seen in its stead
36:54 -  charismatic lightness for the want of the fear of God that should come principally by one means
37:01 -  the recognition of God's historic, present, and future dealings with that people who are yet the apple of His eye,
37:08 -  namely the severe judgments that have come in exile, dispersal, and dealings by God with that people.
37:15 -  Paul says therefore, fear considered the goodness and the severity of God,
37:23 -  and if God will not hesitate to break off that branch, will He hesitate to break you off
37:27 -  if you do not abide in faith? Therefore, fear, there's a dimension lacking
37:33 -  that despoils the Church and accounts for its lightness, the want of the awesome fear
37:39 -  and reverence of God that would have only been known to us essentially by the recognition
37:44 -  of how far He will go with that people. Too bad my other book is not on this table, it's at the printer,
37:53 -  but you can request it. It's called The Holocaust, Where Was God?
37:59 -  And I have the temerity to suggest that God was there and not asleep when six million of His people
38:06 -  were systematically annihilated by the most brilliant, quote, Christian civilization in the world,
38:12 -  Germany, and that that judgment through Germany is ironic and necessary to a Jewish people
38:18 -  who had so elevated German culture and civilization as being itself the messianic ideal,
38:25 -  and that the Holocaust coming through them was God's judgment, both for their own sin
38:30 -  and the sins of their fathers, which had not been ever likely acknowledged. That book was dismissed
38:39 -  in its French edition from being exhibited at a book fair in Lausanne, Switzerland,
38:44 -  because it was considered to be something like The Protocols of Zion, an anti-Semitic book,
38:49 -  because it suggests the Holocaust has judgment for the sin of Israel. If God will take sin that seriously
38:56 -  as to judge that people that tragically, how well do we know Him? And what Jesus is it
39:04 -  that we are promoting and celebrating and feeling effusive about and having palpitations
39:09 -  and other kinds of emotions and effect? Is it in fact really the Son of God who's going to judge the earth
39:17 -  in equity and justice? Do we know God as God? And can we know Him
39:22 -  if we have dismissed that revelation of Himself that is nowhere more accurately set forth
39:28 -  in His full triune Godhead than it is dealing with the people of Israel? The absence of that
39:36 -  has made the Church light and frivolous, open to the celebration of feeling and experience and excitement
39:47 -  to the point where our souls have been so indulged that we can't even tell
39:51 -  where soul ends and spirit begins. We can't even distinguish between the faculty of soul and spirit
39:57 -  and have equated the one as the other. And we call the people of the spirit and our souls are being stirred
40:04 -  through hype, through music, through loudspeakers, through all of the various devices
40:09 -  that betray a foundational emptiness in the Church for the want of the centrality that God intended as normative
40:17 -  and has been lost. I wonder if that's a kind of anti-Semitism. I wonder if there's a pride in the Church
40:23 -  that does not want to give to the Jew a place of last days and final restoration and return because they don't deserve it.
40:32 -  Well, what did you deserve? If that invariably rises up out of your heart, is that not a statement
40:40 -  that you give a scant and outward and external acknowledgement of God's grace as an aspect of your doctrine,
40:47 -  but where you really live, you measure by merit and performance. Not only Israel, not only the Jew,
40:54 -  not only your neighbor, but yourself. No wonder there's the self-hatred and all of the disfiguring things
41:01 -  that happen to human personality and Christian personality of which we have heard in these days.
41:07 -  We don't know as we ought to know. A religion has become an entertainment, an inane, hypnotic laughter of a kind that...
41:22 -  Lord, help me. Where men who are servants of the Word are so affected by the so-called spirit
41:32 -  that they are incapable even of speaking intelligibly. But what they finally croak out is that what they are experiencing now
41:43 -  is greater than anything that they had ever seen performed through their preaching of the Word,
41:51 -  which in fact implies that this experience supersedes the Word and maybe that in fact it's true.
42:01 -  But if it denigrates the Word of God, where is the Church and what is the Gospel by which its mission is to be expressed?
42:10 -  If laughter and experience has come to prevail over the Word of God itself and its own ministers,
42:18 -  faint, collapsing, choke up and become an object of derision in the testimony of what they have received
42:27 -  quote, from God. Well... In my book on the Spirit of Truth
42:45 -  there's a chapter on Ananias and Sapphira. It's a remarkable episode of an incident that occurred in another age
42:54 -  in an hour when the Spirit of God prevailed in such magnitude and purity that the very same act which might well be applauded today
43:01 -  resulted in that day in sudden judgment and death. What do you mean applauded? Yes, let someone come
43:08 -  with a great contribution and we won't ask too much about its source or anything of that kind.
43:15 -  We'll probably give such a person a place of honor and acknowledgement, a deacon at least, if not an elder.
43:22 -  But the Church that identified the lie and was not impressed with the sum is not the Church that today is.
43:31 -  It was a Church then in its glory because it was alert to the issue of truth and deception because it knew
43:40 -  that before the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Power He is first and foremost the Spirit of Truth. And when truth is disallowed,
43:49 -  when truth is compromised, do you think that the dove is going to be around to perform in expressions of power
43:56 -  that serve our need and gratify our souls if we have forsaken Him in His first designation and identity as the Spirit of Truth?
44:06 -  There needs to be a jealous regard for the truth that Peter exercised and therefore was able to discern
44:12 -  the fraud of a man and his wife giving a sum of money, however impressive, as to be the whole, but it was only in part.
44:24 -  Why have you allowed Satan to fill your heart and to lie against the Holy Spirit? Peter said, when it was yours
44:34 -  remained it. Was it not your own when it was sold? Was it not under your control? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart?
44:39 -  You have not lied to men but to God. And he heard these words and his eyes fell down and breathed his last and great fear came
44:46 -  upon all who heard it. Almost in the next breath we hear and with great power did the Apostles give testimony
44:57 -  to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That they brought on litters the sick and the hulk and the insane.
45:04 -  That so much that the shadow of Peter should fall upon them and be healed. Now what follows this respect
45:10 -  for the Spirit of God as the Spirit of Truth is the Spirit of God as the Spirit of Power. We have reversed it.
45:16 -  We have celebrated the power, the signs, the wonders, and relegated the truth
45:22 -  to a distant consideration if indeed any consideration at all. And which of us has not played the game
45:29 -  of giving apart and making that to stand as the whole? Well I remember as a kid even in Brooklyn that we used to say as the depression
45:41 -  born in the generation that the whole truth, that the truth is the whole truth
45:46 -  and nothing but the truth or it's a lie. That's the distinctive character of truth. It's the whole truth
45:54 -  or it's not the truth. And any disqualification, any cutting of corners,
45:59 -  anything less than what is whole and full converts what seems to be impressive into the lie. You say Art, why are you taking pains to dwell on this?
46:08 -  Because it's a statement of the Church today. Because we have only given part. But we call that part full.
46:15 -  Full Gospel, full this, full that. When it's only a part. We have not the reticence, the modesty,
46:23 -  the humility appropriate to a Church whose Lord is the Lamb and His meekness because we're full of hype and exaggeration
46:32 -  and pompous ambition and activity and think that that constitutes the whole. And the great part that's missing
46:42 -  that would have made us whole is the part that I'm describing to you today, namely the centrality of Israel
46:48 -  in the Church's consideration for itself as the Church. If you think that I'm speaking these things because I'm Jewish, you're wrong.
47:01 -  I'm speaking these things because they're true. Apostolically true and prophetically true and need to be restored
47:08 -  if the Church is to be the Church of the last days and be the very provision of God for the redemption of this people
47:15 -  whose time has come for it is time now to obtain the Kingdom. It's their Kingdom, not exclusive for their use
47:25 -  or for their enjoyment, but out of the nexus of their Jerusalem and out of their Zion
47:30 -  shall those things go forth to all nations which can only go forth from them as the redeemed people of the earth
47:36 -  from the throne of David and the promises that God has made to their patriarchs and to David and to themselves
47:43 -  that must be fulfilled because it's the Word of God. And a deliverer must come out of Zion and take transgression from Jacob
47:56 -  according to the covenant that I have made with them that I have written. The issue of Israel's restoration
48:07 -  despite their undeserving all the more because of their undeserving is the issue of God, the issue of His mercy,
48:15 -  the issue of His Word, the issue of His covenant-keeping character. And we are jealous for this God
48:22 -  and we're wooing and mooning and talking about being His bride and the love of Jesus and passion for Jesus.
48:28 -  What is it about this passion for Jesus that catches me in my gut, that has romanticized something in a way that sounds icky
48:38 -  and yet falls short of the celebration and the love of God that one would think would characterize the church that is jealous for its glory, his glory,
48:47 -  and knows it will not be obtained until he is recognized by his own nation and they shall see him whom they have pierced
48:53 -  and mourn for him. So we need to ask ourselves, are we doing anything different from what Ananias and Sapphira did
49:10 -  when we seek and expect the evidence of apostolicity or power while giving ourselves only in part, while presuming to have given ourselves wholly.
49:22 -  We all want the semblance of these things, the comfort of the Spirit, the intimate communion, but we want it at the lesser price of acknowledging truth
49:32 -  as only being doctrinal, the issue of being correct, rather than as the very sum substance, the reality of our lives. We want to speak truth, but not to be true.
49:43 -  We want correct words. We want to acknowledge truth, but not to obey it. We are bringing our partial, phraseological truth
49:52 -  and making that to stand for the whole, as if we have the reality that we're describing. Omitting reference,
50:04 -  let alone any repentant acknowledgement of our own history with this people, and can I say particularly our Catholic history with this people,
50:14 -  in the Inquisitions, burnings at the stake, the sufferings, the rack, the breakings that have followed the Jewish people,
50:21 -  and not the Jewish people only, but every aspect of apostolic reality that has risen up historically before the advent of the Reformation itself.
50:30 -  Can we say that we're true and not take that history into our reckoning? Can we speak about the forgiveness of men for their sins
50:39 -  and not speak about our own as an institution? Is that true? There's a full truth that is truth alone,
50:50 -  and it will be painful to acknowledge, but necessary, or else it will testify against us. So to decide to tolerate one deceit
51:06 -  is to violate the whole truth. To be 99% true, or mostly true, and represent that as the whole truth,
51:15 -  is to lie utterly, and to sin in one part is to sin in the whole. The issue of belief, of love, of lordship
51:22 -  depends upon the belief or love of submission we find easy to give, but it's where we are most tempted
51:30 -  to keep back for ourselves that the issue of truth really lies. What one last thing,
51:37 -  what one final issue, what one reserve is the thing that keeps back
51:43 -  from that utterness toward God that makes truth, truth, and brings to the Church
51:49 -  and to its fellowship the reality of His presence and His glory. How true is true
51:56 -  if we are still celebrating Rome over Zion as being the center of God's glory and rule of the world,
52:12 -  and the center of God's glory and rule of the world, glory and rule.
52:25 -  You see the kind of alignment that the issue of truth will require in terms of our tradition,
52:31 -  our understanding, that stubbornly waits consideration and for the want of which
52:39 -  dislocations have set in and dispositions that have opened us for deception, for pseudo-revival,
52:49 -  for experience, for emotion, for the kinds of things that are questionable and dubious at best,
52:55 -  and may actually be demonic at worst. There's something about the proper apprehension of the centrality of Israel
53:04 -  and the Zion of God over every other consideration. The law of God must go forth out of Zion
53:11 -  that somehow inures us to deception. It puts something into our souls. There's something about biting the bullet
53:19 -  of the judgments of God necessary for Israel that puts an iron in our souls that steadies us and keeps us
53:28 -  from being subject to the kinds of things that would make for deception. The proper recognition of Israel
53:35 -  is the greatest provision of God for the Church than we can know. And the loss of that provision
53:44 -  has left us in a questionable condition that even the best of what we have known charismatically has not been the answer.
53:53 -  And what we have come to witness now as we come here and to the end of its history is a kind of melancholy of reminiscence
54:01 -  about some of its high points and other times which we benefited and were moved. And now we're witness to a kind of
54:09 -  end of the story melancholy. Interesting to hear the anecdotes and experiences shared by our brothers.
54:22 -  But for me, it sets up just a note of sadness that the glory has departed. And maybe it could not be retained
54:30 -  because we have not an adequate wineskin. And I'm suggesting that the wineskin is not some institutional
54:37 -  or other kind of correction that was wanting. Though I myself am in an apostolic community of saints face to face in the muddy and remote place
54:48 -  to which God has brought us in northern Minnesota. But that the wineskin is more readily a wineskin of understanding,
54:58 -  of an apostolic, prophetic way of perceiving the faith and the issues of it. And for the want of that,
55:07 -  what measure of wine we have had has leaked out and dissipated and is going away. And that the best that we can say
55:15 -  and hope and encourage as we heard earlier today is that something would come in to affect our children to maintain
55:22 -  a standard of life and virtue in a world that is increasingly evil. That sounds very much like the hope for approval of
55:32 -  and continuation of middle class values. Well, I'm all for that. But is that the best that could be hoped for?
55:40 -  And is that the purpose for which God has poured out His Spirit? Is that the fitting of the Church
55:46 -  for its apostolic mandate? Is that a provision to ennore us against the suffering and the opposition
55:53 -  and persecution that will come for our identification with Jews when they will be a hated people among all nations?
56:01 -  Unless the Spirit of God and the gifts of God are understood and seen in the context of the apostolic framework of God's intention
56:10 -  as a besieged community of sanity in the midst of a sea of hostility and worldly hatred,
56:17 -  we make the Spirit of God and its gifts serve a lesser and other purpose. It accommodates us rather than God.
56:27 -  And you wonder if God is in that business providing that accommodation or that something else has come in its place
56:34 -  and that we have not the discernment to recognize whether or not it is of God. If it seems to bring a measure of excitement,
56:43 -  a measure of enjoyment, a measure of relief, a measure of healing that I'm sure the powers of this world can easily provide
56:50 -  in order to accommodate us in the deception of that kind. The Holy Spirit needs to be restored to the context of God's intention
56:59 -  and that has at its center the restoration of a people who have not even the faintest notion
57:06 -  of their eternal destiny or a desire for it and want only to be one among many nations. Nevertheless, God's word toward them
57:14 -  and the gifts and callings of God must be fulfilled, for they are irrevocable and without repentance,
57:21 -  or God is not God. Let me try and conclude. So to speak of a 21st century is to betray
57:40 -  a complete loss of this eschatological and apocalyptic expectation, the dynamic that made the early church the church,
57:49 -  and to substitute lesser excitements, and to leave undisturbed and still prevailing over many nations,
57:55 -  the kings, the rulers in the heavenly places who rage against God and against His anointed and seek to break their bans at Sunder.
58:03 -  Their final defeat and the release of the nations to that theocratic rule is the eternal purpose of God through the church.
58:10 -  To forfeit this calling constitutes our last day's apostasy, the great falling away of which Paul spoke,
58:20 -  however much we might be occupied with the benevolent concerns of men. For to be occupied with the benevolent concerns of men,
58:28 -  their healing, their deliverance, even their salvation, is to be occupied only in part
58:34 -  rather than in whole. It's the occupation with the whole that is the radically requiring aspect,
58:42 -  much more than the laying on of hands for the sick, is the being to Israel the most recalcitrant, stubborn and opposing people
58:50 -  of whom Paul says in all candor, they are the enemies of the Gospel for your sake.
58:57 -  Little wonder that we shun them and we would much rather minister to one another, and even to hippies,
59:03 -  than to take up the central task of the church, which is the reason for our salvation so as to move them to jealousy.
59:13 -  I ask you who have a history in the charismatic movement, in some proportion that I myself have it,
59:20 -  where have we ever seen, even at our best, that reality that would move
59:26 -  unbelieving and cynical Jews to jealousy in the observing of what we celebrate and delight in as charismatic.
59:34 -  Interesting that Paul himself does not answer the question or give us an asterisk at the bottom of Romans 11
59:41 -  to explain what it is that will move Jews to jealousy, but this much we know it's going to take more than anything
59:47 -  we have been presently able yet to perform. They're going to have to see something of a heavenly kind, of a reality that's unknown to them
59:55 -  and least expected in Gentiles, and they'll have to see it in our conduct, not so much only with each other,
01:00:02 -  but in response to them, especially at that time the least of these his brethren,
01:00:08 -  hated, despised, disfigured, grotesquely cast out, discombobulated,
01:00:14 -  altogether out of sorts, not in their best, and ungrateful for the mercy that you will extend
01:00:20 -  and be quick to express it. If you need their gratitude, if you need their approval,
01:00:26 -  you'll not find it. And if there's something in you that needs that, I will be disappointed in not having received it
01:00:32 -  or offended by those who betray your expectation for their being cute, you're going to show forth
01:00:38 -  a face other than the face of God. You're going to show forth a disappointed face,
01:00:44 -  the kind of face that Jews expect to see when they look at Gentiles. But it will not be the face of which God speaks
01:00:50 -  in Ezekiel 20, when he says to them, I will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations
01:00:56 -  face to face. I'm a believer today, saved, because 37, 38 years ago,
01:01:02 -  in my own wilderness, marched through the nations with a pack on my back,
01:01:08 -  being uprooted, not by persecution, but by collapsed and fallen Gods. God revealed himself to me
01:01:14 -  through snub-nosed, freckle-faced, sandy-head Gentile believers who picked me up
01:01:20 -  from the side of road, spoke a word to me, were kind, gracious, unfearful, transparent,
01:01:26 -  and without guile. I was moved to jealousy something I had never seen in universities
01:01:32 -  or Marxist institutes, and all the more powerfully revealed when it shines forth out of a face
01:01:38 -  that we think Gentile. If the Spirit of God has not brought you to that luster, that radiance, that glory
01:01:44 -  in the church whose discipline and dealings and affects your character
01:01:50 -  so to reveal it, we're falling short of the glory of God. And the final test of it
01:01:56 -  will be the test that they themselves constitute when we will pass, when they will pass through our midst
01:02:02 -  in their last days flight and affliction. What face will they see then?
01:02:08 -  What face am I seeing now? So, in the unfathomable wisdom of God I believe that the issue of Israel
01:02:22 -  rightly, prophetically understood as God's provision for an errant church because it alone provides the perspective
01:02:28 -  by which the church itself is to be understood. Its origins is derived from Israel
01:02:34 -  for salvation is of the Jews. Its continuation by being grafted into her tree
01:02:40 -  and living by the life that is expressed through her root. The church's destiny as God's
01:02:48 -  salvific agency for the restoration of that people in moving them to jealousy
01:02:54 -  showing them the face of their own God which is full of mercy and unconditional
01:03:00 -  in His love. Because out of that Zion comes Israel's deliverance
01:03:06 -  for the fullness when the fullness of the Gentiles come in. This fullness, this Holy Ghost
01:03:12 -  full charismatica when it comes in and it will not come in
01:03:22 -  short of the work of the cross. All Israel shall be saved as it is written for the deliverer shall come out of Zion
01:03:30 -  and take transgression from Jacob according to the covenant that I have made with them
01:03:36 -  as it is written. There's a Zion out of which the deliverer must come.
01:03:42 -  You are that Zion when you have come to that fullness of the Gentiles.
01:03:48 -  And I'm wondering if our church, our charismatica our revivals
01:03:54 -  our renewal our celebration of personalities
01:04:00 -  has promoted that kind of reality that kind of maturity or rather the solishness
01:04:06 -  that leaves us in the rather unhappy state in which we are that could not yet be the Zion
01:04:12 -  out of which Israel's deliverance comes. That's why Paul was made the apostle to the Gentiles
01:04:18 -  and that's why as a Jew I'm speaking to you. For the church is not the kingdom
01:04:26 -  but an interim provision for Israel's restoration for it is time now to restore the kingdom of David
01:04:32 -  to that people on David's throne on the holy hill of Zion where there's no kingdom at all.
01:04:38 -  The kingdom of God will either go forth from that place or not go forth at all. That means no war
01:04:44 -  going forth to the nations. The continuation in war. The continuation in armaments.
01:04:50 -  The continuation in suffering. The continuation in death. The continuation in incest and every kind of
01:04:56 -  vile rape, slaughter, mayhem that prevails over the world until the law of God can go forth
01:05:02 -  from the one place designated by the nation redeemed for the honor of expressing it
01:05:08 -  and whose redemption has come through a Zion out of which their deliverer comes
01:05:14 -  to praise, come to maturity come to fullness, come to glory come to truth, come to sacrifice
01:05:20 -  come to the cross. If we think that we could obtain this lustre, this radiance short of
01:05:26 -  the dealings of God and the deaths to which we must be brought we are of all people most to be deceived.
01:05:32 -  One can almost suggest that maybe what was foundationally wrong with the whole charismatic movement
01:05:38 -  was some attempt to enjoy the semblance of it and its excitement
01:05:44 -  without necessarily having to experience the cross. We want the reality
01:05:50 -  of the effulgence without the suffering that precedes that glory. Church itself
01:05:56 -  is a suffering, if you but know. And until we come to it how shall there be a company
01:06:04 -  framed from it who can speak with apostolic and prophetic authority to the dead bones that they might live.
01:06:10 -  The Church is a means and not an end in itself. But by being that means it
01:06:16 -  attains an end more glorious than that of the redeemed millennial nation itself. We who are a no people as the
01:06:22 -  Church have become the people of God to move to envy that nation that has lost that very identity.
01:06:28 -  In the final frenzy that is now brewing that will mark the experience of Jews in the last days
01:06:34 -  in their own self-opposing ignorance they likely regard us as enemies
01:06:40 -  and the threat to their Jewishness in the anti-Semitic furor of the last days time of Jacob's trouble.
01:06:46 -  And we may have to suffer this. This misunderstanding. This failure to recognize that
01:06:52 -  ours is a heart of love toward them. They may even have to suffer at their hands as Stephen did
01:06:58 -  a martyrdom as a crucial necessity, a sacrifice to bring by it
01:07:04 -  if that alone is the final requirement the revelation of the Lord that turned Saul from persecutor
01:07:10 -  to apostle and will bring that nation from opposing God to its own apostolate
01:07:16 -  to bless all the families of the earth. This is more than you can grasp in this speaking.
01:07:22 -  You'll have to hear it again on tape. So our coming under these purposes of God
01:07:28 -  for Israel's redemption this firstborn among the nations is calculated for our humility
01:07:34 -  as we cannot expect their understanding nor gratitude for our sacrifice on their behalf.
01:07:40 -  And like Christ dying for us as sinners yet dead in their transgressions
01:07:46 -  we also must suffer for them while they are yet in their transgressions and in that
01:07:52 -  mutuality and in that willingness to suffer them as he suffered us we show forth the face
01:07:58 -  of their God. The truth of our condition
01:08:04 -  will be revealed in its depths and brought to a full sanctification that would not
01:08:10 -  otherwise have been seen on that except by the crisis that the Jews of the last days
01:08:16 -  will bring to the church that is called to their redemption.
01:08:22 -  Well I've said my peace inadequately
01:08:28 -  too briefly. I want to pray for it as I began to end.
01:08:34 -  Lord we need a mercy to understand
01:08:42 -  what this strange man is trying to convey. If it takes
01:08:48 -  a mercy to understand it what will it take to perform it? We're sensing
01:08:54 -  Lord we have lived beneath the standard of your glory. We have substituted excitement
01:09:02 -  for glory. We have been shallow, lacking in understanding, self-centered
01:09:08 -  in our Christianity as it ministers to us and brings to us a gratification of delight and enjoyment
01:09:14 -  for which we will come by the thousands but we lost the pivot and the access
01:09:20 -  that there's a call for our salvation beyond ourselves and outside of ourselves and other than us toward a people
01:09:26 -  whom we ourselves would not have chosen to whom we have scant love or even respect now, the Jew.
01:09:32 -  What a wisdom of God to select them to reveal to us
01:09:38 -  the truth of our condition that would not otherwise have been seen. That sentimentalizes, that
01:09:44 -  transposes, that takes the tabernacle of David and makes it to be a fanciful symbol for something
01:09:50 -  other than the theocratic rule of God or for Edom and of all nations to which
01:09:56 -  that God has called. We have taken liberties, my God, with your word and with the faith
01:10:02 -  and with your spirit. Certainly you have an intention beyond renewing what is dear
01:10:08 -  to us. It's the issue of your glory and your kingdom and it will require the power
01:10:14 -  of your life in those whose lives have been substituted, have been sacrificed and brought to you in full.
01:10:20 -  Nothing withheld, nothing in part making to stand for the whole but the totality of God, even
01:10:26 -  that elevates Zion over Rome and every other adjustment that needs to be
01:10:32 -  made in the light of these great eschatological truths so
01:10:38 -  long unknown to us. Bless this people, Lord. Bless this tape. Bless this message.
01:10:44 -  Let it only be a point of beginning. Let it set in motion an examination of Romans
01:10:50 -  11 at least, which the Church has omitted from its consideration and from which the best
01:10:56 -  of your charismatic speakers over the years have personally confessed to me have remained to them
01:11:02 -  a mystery. One that they have circumvented and omitted
01:11:08 -  from their consideration yet it is central to Paul's whole apostolic framework of understanding
01:11:14 -  in the greatest of all of his epistles, the book of Romans. My God, let it set in motion
01:11:20 -  an examination of chapter 11 alone that we might ask how is it that that
01:11:26 -  chapter ends with the greatest pain of praise expressed in all scripture?
01:11:32 -  Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,
01:11:38 -  who has been his counselor? Who has given to him and shall be given again? For of him
01:11:44 -  and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory
01:11:50 -  forever. Paul's celebration of Israel is not because of a Jew to his own
01:11:56 -  ethnic kind, but because he knew in his apostolic understanding that the issue of Israel's redemption
01:12:02 -  in the last days, which is of God and through God and unto God, is the issue of God's glory
01:12:08 -  forever. When you will know it, the Church will be the Church.
01:12:14 -  It will not need movements. It will remain steadfast in the truth and
01:12:20 -  character that God intended from the first when it embraces the totality of its faith
01:12:26 -  and has not omitted dissent. Let it be, Lord, I pray that it would not be an exaggeration
01:12:32 -  that the entire conference, this entire outing, was a platform by which you could insert
01:12:38 -  this needed word. Let it not fall to the ground, I pray. Be jealous, O
01:12:44 -  Lord. We thank you and give you praise for the privilege of the occasion and the sounding of it
01:12:50 -  in Yeshua's holy name and God's people's said, Amen.
