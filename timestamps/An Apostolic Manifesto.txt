An Apostolic Manifesto

00:00 -  Because this is not going to be a sermon, this is going to be a proclamation, a manifesto of the apostolic distinctive. It will be over your head, it will be confusing, it will employ language that is totally unfamiliar to you, it will be irrelevant to your present need, but it will also be a plumb line come down from heaven
00:26 -  at a point of time in this city and in this place to which you will one day bend and align yourself. So of all the things that could be spoken, the Lord has impressed me to speak this. I much prefer a biblical message where I would be speaking from a text, but this is not a text, this is a statement.
00:53 -  It's entitled Thoughts Upon Rising that the Lord gave me in 98. I think this is about the fifth time that he's had me to speak from it. So Lord, be with this mouth as you are with the ears of these children.
01:11 -  We have asked largely of you, you know it, in the prayers that have preceded my God this moment, and we look now for your answer. Indeed may it be a plumb line from heaven and something as I prayed early this morning that will not again be withdrawn, but remain as a permanent guideline to which, my God, we should align ourselves.
01:33 -  So it's time, Lord, we sense, for the Church to be the Church in fact. And so may you put before us the apostolic distinctives that make the Church the Church. No man can give a definitive and comprehensive summation of the whole genius of that word and of such a Church,
01:55 -  but let this be a broad guideline and a first statement that will enter, my God, our thought, our contemplation and our conduct. And we thank and give you praise for this time now. Be with us in your wonderful grace to be the High Priest and the Apostle of our confession,
02:13 -  who is alone entitled to speak these things. We thank you and give you praise in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, this began with a consideration of the gifts of the Spirit,
02:29 -  which in our charismatic age I think have been abused or misused or misemployed. And I was fishing for something to give expression to the disquiet that has been in my soul all through the charismatic generation, where they spoke about renewing denominations or uplifting the beings as if this is a kind of accessory to our religious self-interest.
03:00 -  And I thought it fell short, it missed entirely the profound intention of God. So I began to contemplate what is the context in which God intends the operation of the gifts of the Spirit. And from that first thought, I wrote down in that early morning hour the statement that you're about to hear,
03:23 -  that the consideration of the gifts of the Spirit outside the context of an apostolic and eschatological faith, which means a radical anticipation of an end, a body or a church that knows it's moving toward a consummation. This is the requirement in which God, I believe, intended the operation of his Spirit.
03:48 -  Because any body of believers that has laid hold of this eschatological faith that pertains to an end, a consummation, a conclusion, the end of the age, the coming of the King, will be marked before the powers of darkness as a body to be feared, to be resisted, to be opposed.
04:11 -  Because it will see it as a threat to its whole prevailing religious establishment and will ventilate its anger and its spite against such a body. So that the operation of the Spirit, the benefit of the Spirit, the instruction, the guidance,
04:31 -  will be a critical factor for a body that is experiencing opposition from the powers of darkness who recognize it as now formidable and a body to be opposed. Because they have consciously and willfully understood and have taken to themselves
04:48 -  the purposes of God by which the age is to be concluded. They have moved from a mere succession of Sundays or a Christianity that has to do with their own blessing and the benefit that they receive and are consciously seeking to be a body in which
05:04 -  the ultimate and eternal purposes of God are to be fulfilled. That acknowledgement, that conscious choosing of a seeing of yourself in those purposes instantly marks you as a body to be opposed.
05:19 -  And that kind of opposition calls for and requires the wisdom of God, the direction of God that is given through the operation of His Spirit through gifts. Such a body will find itself also in disjunction from the world, a disjuncture.
05:37 -  It will be a sore thumb. It will not be of this world. It will be a band of pilgrims, strangers and sojourners in the earth who are remarkably, what shall I say, free from the blandishments and the inducements,
05:52 -  even the seductions that are increasingly powerful in the world. They're in the world. They're not of the world. Not only do they recognize that, but they see the world for what it is as system,
06:03 -  as powerful, as vicious, as calculated against the life of men that wants to suck it out and to make of men only an object of merchandise or commerce. It touches the world only as it must and then faintly and with reservation.
06:21 -  These things go together. So it sees the world in its systems and false values and consciously repudiates them, does not lend itself to them, and to the degree therefore that such a body is free
06:38 -  from the influence of the world, which is the outworking of the powers of the air that jerk and manipulate nations and whose false values have been inculcated in the world, that to the degree to which such a body is consciously free from those influences,
06:55 -  it is already a harbinger and a statement of a kingdom come. It's already a foretaste, a foreshadowing of the great freedom that will be in the world when the king himself reigns
07:07 -  and all that is false has been brought to naught. And to the degree that it enjoys that freedom, it's capable of setting free those who are presently ensnared, even enslaved by that system.
07:23 -  So it's able to emancipate and to deliver the world's deceived victims, not just by its proclamation, important though that is, but by its demonstration, by what it is in itself, by its manifest freedom from the influences of the world.
07:39 -  Men are aghast when they come in contact with such a body. And it has to be a body for an individual to give such witnesses one thing, but for a corporate entity to abide in that remarkable freedom from the world,
07:54 -  its values and all that is false is a freeing experience for those who will stumble upon it because it reveals another alternative. It reveals another reality. It reveals another kingdom already come
08:07 -  to the degree in which you are enjoying and moving in this kind of reality, which by the way cannot be obtained except in and through a body because the powers of the world and its darkness and its wiles
08:20 -  and its subtlety requires the alertness of an entire body and the strength that comes from their prayer, their counsel, that begins to see if any one of its members is in any way trailing off
08:35 -  or losing the kind of intentionality, the kind of conscious and willful walk before God that such freedom requires. We need the strength, the prayer, the encouragement, the counsel
08:49 -  that will come from others of like mind and heart and spirit who are joined with us in an endeavor of this kind, for we will be profoundly resisted and constitute a threat of a kind
09:00 -  that the powers of darkness have not experienced in all of the entire charismatic generation and all of the loud profession of taking cities through militant worship and all of the other shticklach and gimmicks and devices
09:13 -  that the Church has sought to employ that have availed nothing. It's not by some auditory feat, F-E-A-T, that the powers of the air are going to be intimidated, let alone defeated,
09:27 -  but by a demonstration of another wisdom. People who are free from their influence, who recognize how nefarious and sinister the powers of the air are, who prevail over every nation,
09:38 -  over every city, over every locality. That kind of walk cannot be obtained by individuals independent of a body of like minded saints who are consciously and willfully joined
09:50 -  in such an undertaking that clearly makes necessary something more than mere Sunday services, however good they may be. We will need a frequency of fellowship,
10:02 -  a going again from house to house daily and breaking bread. We will need the counsel of our brothers. We will need to be in a place where sin is recognized at its very inception
10:12 -  because we have a proximity to each other and therefore we can see when a man's voice changes, as I've been mentioning to congregations, watch your pastors and when they become professional
10:23 -  and their voices become studied and affected, you had better be warning them. If their voices are no longer natural and they're not sharing in a reality that we can appreciate and they have become somewhat studied, self-conscious,
10:37 -  they need at that very moment to be alerted by those who love them enough to do so in a love that can receive correction. Correction is the name of the game.
10:48 -  And that kind of thing cannot take place in a fellowship of isolated individualities that come together for the purposes of a service on a Sunday. It can only be a reality where there's an interaction, a frequency of relationship,
11:08 -  communion, because you are joined with a conscious purpose, to be in that community where you are, an entity of another kind. Not so much that will win the esteem of men,
11:19 -  but win the disfavor and opposition of the powers of darkness. So I've had to say in these recent weeks to third world ministers in the Philippines, Indonesia and elsewhere, better that you should be known by the powers of darkness
11:33 -  than you should be esteemed by men. But you'll not be known by the powers of darkness unless you willingly refuse the esteem of men. And to say that to men who have come out of poverty
11:45 -  and are enjoying a certain kind of status and dignity as ministers to forsake the esteem of men is a profound requirement of the cross to ministers of third world countries that would not be as demanding to men whose identity and security is not as critical in western nations.
12:06 -  You cannot enjoy both the esteem of men and the opposition of the powers. We need to make a conscious choice and they'll know when that choice is made, because Jesus they know and Paul they know, but the church of Phoenix who?
12:21 -  So if we refuse this direction, you can see that this is already going to require something. This is going to be sacrificial. This is no mere Sunday matter. If we refuse this, we condemn ourselves to a mere charismatica
12:42 -  and we're playing out our Christianity harmlessly and irrelevantly to the cosmic drama whose conclusion is imminent and near. That's redundant. Imminent means near.
12:54 -  But because I'm not sure that you know imminent, I'm saying near. And the theocratic consummation which is at hand. Here's where I lose you. Here's where I have to lose you.
13:05 -  Here's where it's recorded that you can hear and consider. What did he say? Here's what he said. This is more compacted in this one statement than a dozen Sundays could illumine.
13:20 -  But what are the alternatives? Harmless charismatica in a Christianity that is irrevocably played out without any conscious awareness of the cosmic drama in which the church is set.
13:33 -  What is that drama? It's the awareness that we're moving toward a climax, a conclusion that is imminent, it's at the door, it's near. These are indeed the last days.
13:45 -  And that should become for us a little perp and harmless invocation without a sense of the depth of awareness of what last days means. We've already missed it. And we've done that with everything.
13:58 -  We've taken the holiest language and we have transmuted it into a commonplace rhetoric of a new fad, a new fancy, a new language as if the whole thing is to be verbally played out
14:10 -  and we're missing the whole reality that God is wanting. May the last days be for us, the last days. You say, how will we know when that's so?
14:20 -  Well, you'll no longer be contemplating your retirement. You'll no longer look upon this as the best of all possible worlds. And that will go on interminably and whatever is wrong,
14:33 -  that will be rectified over a course of time. You know that you're moving toward a climax and one in which the powers of darkness do not relish,
14:42 -  who know that their time is short and therefore are all the more vehement and vicious in their opposition to those who have this kind of consciousness and awareness of the end.
14:52 -  Listen, you dear saints, if we have no awareness of the end, our present is nullified. Our present is made a humdrum monotony without significance
15:03 -  unless we know that this present is related to that end. And because it's an end of an ultimate kind in which we shall be severely opposed at its climax,
15:12 -  perhaps even requiring martyrdom, the blood of the saints under the altar, therefore our present should be an anticipation and a preparation consciously toward that end.
15:24 -  That distinguishes an apostolic body, and I'd love to see it in this city, for an apostolic body is a sending body
15:32 -  because it has that of which should be sent, something to communicate. It has something that has been shaped and formed
15:40 -  in the reality of its own corporate life, which the world and the Church in the world desperately needs. And therefore there's a sending to communicate
15:49 -  that reality of pain in that body by the laying on of hands so that they might be sent. And in sending, bring with them the dimension of that reality
15:59 -  and that authority, which is a whole way of perceiving things that is on time for the Church.
16:12 -  So the operation of the Spirit and its gifts is given an urgent and seen as an urgent provision as to a besieged and militant presence in the midst of a sea
16:24 -  of active hostility against it and whose end-time task is urgent and invites rejection in the world
16:32 -  and fierce opposition by the powers of darkness who recognize its authenticity as a real threat to themselves. The issue of authenticity, the issue of reality
16:43 -  that the powers of darkness alone are required to acknowledge is the issue of the truth of your consecration. If it's shallow, if it's a series of mindless altar calls
16:54 -  and a few crocodile tears, they yawn in our face. They know when a consecration has been made where the life is laid down ultimately and totally before God.
17:04 -  And that's the kind of thing that I'm seeing in these recent weeks of activity. Men and women taking their shoes off,
17:11 -  staid New Zealanders and stretching themselves out before God and here am I, whatever it requires, whatever the Lord demands,
17:23 -  I'm making that total consecration. And that alerts the powers that this is a body to be feared because such a people, at the same time,
17:34 -  are living consciously and sacrificially as being the appointed salvific agents of God toward the people of Israel.
17:44 -  This isn't a little accidental overlay. This is intrinsic to apostolic comprehension of what the Church is.
17:52 -  That Church that fits the description that I have so far been making will of itself come to and comprehend and recognize its calling toward the restoration of Israel
18:05 -  in its last days' tribulation. It will certainly dismiss any thought that is going to be raptured away
18:12 -  at the time when its presence is most radically required, for its presence is salvational for Jews in the world in their last time of sifting called the time of Jacob's trouble.
18:23 -  This is not an adjunct for the Church that is central, primary, to the Church's own consideration of itself
18:29 -  and what its purposes are in God. That's for the Church worldwide. Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore,
18:37 -  how much more Phoenix where there's such a substantial Jewish presence where you know that you're going to be thrown into some connection
18:46 -  with this people in the shakings that are future. And so it requires a sacrificial lifestyle knowing that there will be such a demand
18:58 -  because this Israel, when restored, is of course the issue of the King and the Kingdom. God is not restoring them because they deserve a homeland
19:08 -  after long centuries in diaspora, but their restoration is the coming of the King so that the law might go forth out of Zion
19:17 -  and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem of redeemed and restored nation. That's why the powers of darkness
19:23 -  will be in such a fit of frenzy and opposition to anything that pertains to Jewish rescue, salvation and redemption in the last days
19:33 -  aided by a Church that is willing to give itself sacrificially toward that end. The issue of Jewish restoration
19:40 -  is the issue of the Kingdom of God. And the powers of darkness are the false, usurping rulers of this world
19:46 -  and do not want to relinquish and forsake that usurping activity which they have enjoyed in an unchecked and uncontested way
19:55 -  since ages millennial. It's the coming of the King as the one seated on the throne of David
20:01 -  and the holy hill of Zion with a redeemed and restored Israel that marks their end.
20:07 -  We need to know that, or we will not understand the frenzy and the rage that will be poured out upon Jews in the last days
20:14 -  because the powers of darkness in their corrupt and perverse wisdom recognize that the only way to avert the threat
20:21 -  to their false rule is by annihilating that people whose return would terminate them. That's why you'll have to hear this on tape.
20:32 -  So, it'll be a time of sifting and chastening the time of Jacob's trouble that concludes the age and brings also Israel's king
20:43 -  and his rule over the nations. It recognizes and accepts the ultimacy of such a task and mandate
20:50 -  which it has consciously and willfully adopted as central or primary to its whole purpose for being. See, there's got to be a conscious awareness
21:00 -  and a taking of these tasks to ourselves and the mandate willfully. You don't come to this through osmosis.
21:07 -  This is not something that's going to happen and fall upon us like a mist, but a recognition that has to come
21:13 -  of what these last days mean as it pertains to the people of Israel and what is the role and function of the Church
21:21 -  toward this people that Jesus will measure as he determines the eternal destiny of men with regard to one question,
21:30 -  what did you do with the least of these, my brethren? That they are going to be least is without question. That the most celebrated and prosperous
21:39 -  and well-named and known Jews who are riding the crest of the world's wave will find themselves with only the shirt on their backs
21:48 -  and cast out into the nations in the most desolate of deprived conditions. The least of these, my brethren.
21:54 -  We have to lay hold of this prophetic understanding and then determine that we choose to be a factor in their deliverance in that time.
22:03 -  That one choice, that one conscious deliberation, that one taking of that mandate to ourselves transfigures the Church.
22:11 -  I don't know how to tell you, but every aspect of the faith is brought into a new kind of perception
22:19 -  and a new depth of awareness and a new reality once this central key is fitted into the Church's consciousness
22:27 -  as the primary purpose for its being. Anything that has to do with any subtle key of anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic residue
22:38 -  for which we think we might be free will be flushed to the surface. That they should be the singular object
22:44 -  of our concern and God's. What about us, the older brother who didn't come in to celebrate
22:51 -  the return of the prodigal son? This has got to be played out in the Church. So there's a flushing out, there's a dealing,
22:57 -  there's a depth and intensity of the work of God in the body itself, in the sanctification. Because God says in Ezekiel 20 to Israel,
23:06 -  I will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations face to face. And there you will come into the bond of my covenant
23:14 -  and under the rod of my authority. Something happens to a remnant of Jews in that last day's final sifting
23:20 -  that is de facto by which they return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord, everlasting joy upon their heads,
23:28 -  mourning and sighing, fleeing away. And I'm saying this morning, there'll be no return at all by any,
23:35 -  unless there's a Church in the earth that already anticipates this and is preparing itself to be
23:41 -  the salvific agent of God toward this distressed people in a soon coming time,
23:48 -  for when it comes, it will come suddenly. But that it will not find us unprepared, both spiritually and physically.
24:02 -  Because it's central to the whole purpose for our being, and needs therefore
24:08 -  the strategic direction of God obtained through the operation of the Spirit, through trusted members in the body,
24:16 -  whose prophecies are not some kind of soulish exercise or drawing of attention to themselves,
24:24 -  but a trusted expression of God's wisdom and will in critical moments of decision, where even past
24:31 -  success with God is no assurance of this moment. We need to come to a place
24:37 -  where the jihatsi elves in our congregation can speak the word of the Lord in crisis moments.
24:44 -  The battle's not yours, but mine, say the Lord. Go ye out against them tomorrow. And when King Jehoshaphat and Judah
24:51 -  heard this prophetic pronouncement, they fell on their faces and worshiped the Lord
24:57 -  as if this were the definitive and unquestioned statement of God, though it was only a prophecy being issued by a man.
25:03 -  But it was a man known, whose character was tested, who was in relationship,
25:09 -  and therefore his word could be received as God's word. Can you see that what we have been trafficking in
25:15 -  and shallowly employing and are not even clear whether a prophecy that we're hearing
25:21 -  is of the Spirit or of man, that kind of dubious, hazy condition can no longer be tolerated
25:28 -  in an hour that has come where there's a deep seriousness of God in the Church for its purpose and call
25:34 -  that needs to hear from God in crisis and critical moments through a word of prophecy,
25:40 -  a tongue and interpretation, a word of wisdom, the operation of the gifts of the Spirit
25:46 -  now in the context that God had always intended and which is now being obtained by the congregation
25:52 -  that has consciously come to this serious place in him and has the relationships by which
25:58 -  its members are tested and known of each other so that when a word comes forth we know that it's not of man but of God.
26:06 -  No accident that such a fellowship that its prayer and its worship reflects and expresses the truth
26:12 -  of this reality. Because prayer and worship are not luxuries, but our
26:20 -  spiritual weapons, and are no more relevant, no real, than we ourselves are. No more significant
26:26 -  than the truth of what we are in ourselves and before God. So it's not a technique
26:32 -  or a methodology that is required but an expression of a worship that issues from the experience
26:38 -  of God's redemptive power in our lives, for we are in something earnest together
26:44 -  and we're not ashamed to be dealt with. And when we receive such dealings, and it will come from a brother
26:50 -  or a sister, or the depths and the intensity of God's working when we're a body of this kind, you're going to
26:56 -  give expression in joy to the release and the freedom that comes from the sanctifying work that has
27:02 -  waited for this condition to be obtained. Because God will not meet us on our terms. He'll not play our
27:08 -  game. He waits for that which is true, that which is real, that which is earnest, that
27:14 -  which acknowledges sin, corruption and need, then we experience the grace,
27:20 -  then we give praise and express worship, then our prayer is relative to the reality
27:26 -  to which we have come, and that kind of prayer is powerful and moves
27:32 -  heaven. For it has moved out of a casual conglomerate
27:38 -  of saints, who essential focus had been upon themselves and whose spiritual egocentricity
27:44 -  had never been broken. Oh, I know that's a fancy statement. But we can bring egocentrism
27:52 -  into the church as profoundly as we knew it in the world. All we have done
27:58 -  is to shift the object. In the world it was carnal pleasure, delight, material things.
28:04 -  But in the church, it is still ego, it is still self. It is how did you enjoy the meeting? What did you think of
28:10 -  the speaker? How did you like? How did you, you, you, like, like, like? That is an inveterate
28:16 -  power that can only be broken when, when we ourselves are not the center of our
28:22 -  own concern and preoccupation, but God and his purposes in the context that I'm setting forth today
28:28 -  that I'm calling apostolic. From this casual conglomeration of individualities
28:34 -  into such a body that has come to this kind of chosen identification
28:40 -  knowing that it brings sacrifice. Which means suffering
28:50 -  because it's not a naive body. It knows that the church is a place of suffering before it's a place of glory.
28:56 -  And anybody who has had anything to do with Ben Israel over these 26 years or any other
29:02 -  comparable community knows that suffering is intrinsic to this kind of relationship. It's not because we
29:08 -  intend to molest each other or to, to constitute a threat or, or
29:14 -  an annoyance, but just the very nature of things in the what is caught up in a body
29:20 -  in differing places of maturity background in the intensity of that life must necessarily
29:26 -  express itself in a way that will bring a suffering before it will bring a glory. And
29:32 -  the thing that distinguishes the church of the kind that I'm describing is that it's willing for such a suffering.
29:38 -  Even on this trip, I've prayed for more than one who had been burned in community
29:44 -  in some earlier time in the 1970s when the novelty of community was circulating
29:50 -  and invariably ended with disaster and pain, loss and all of the other kinds of things. And I'm
29:56 -  saying to them, what the cross will be for you in the last days is a willingness to go back to that same
30:02 -  configuration and context in which you suffered at the first. And make yourself vulnerable again
30:08 -  for exactly the same injury by which you have only recently been healed or still
30:14 -  are reeling. Are you willing to go back into a context that you know is going to be painful and difficult?
30:20 -  Shelley will remember in June myself, occasions in our history, Ben Israel, when we had
30:26 -  to come into a meeting where the atmosphere was so charged and so tense in unresolved conflict that
30:32 -  we were assured that it was finally the end of the community. But we went into the meeting. You stopped breathing
30:38 -  but you went in. Expecting the worst. What could possibly come out of this? It was hopeless
30:44 -  and so charged with tension and misunderstanding and the way saints misconstrued each other. It's remarkable
30:50 -  the subjectivities of the saints and how emphatic and sure they are about the rightness of the way in which
30:56 -  they see and perceive. And you have to bear that. And the remarkable thing is that you walk into meetings
31:02 -  like that, holding your breath, knowing that you're not even going to be able to breathe under such pressure and tension
31:08 -  two hours later or three. You're not walking out of the meeting. You're floating out.
31:14 -  Something has happened of a transcendent kind. It had to be transcendent because the issues were so complex,
31:20 -  so knotted, so beyond any ability religiously to solve that unless there was a transcendent
31:26 -  answer from God, we were at an end. But because we were willing for the crisis of such
31:32 -  ultimate things, we came out in a transcendent place where your
31:38 -  feet were not even on the ground and you don't return to where you were before the crisis. You move on in the new quality
31:44 -  of life and understanding and relationship that has been obtained through the crisis. This is church
31:50 -  saints. And we've seen to it that we are sufficiently
31:56 -  insulated from such possibilities and are content with mere Sunday attendance.
32:02 -  Well, you can choose that, but you'll be eternally embarrassed if you will. You will have forfeited
32:08 -  the eternal glory. You will have forfeited eternal reward because the body of this kind is
32:14 -  eternally conscious that its conduct in this present moment is set in
32:20 -  eternity and that there's an issue of eternal judgment, eternal reward. It's very much aware
32:26 -  that there's a Lord coming who will bring his rewards with him and give to every man according to his work.
32:32 -  We know that we're living in the anticipation of eternity and the thing that will shame us and goad us
32:38 -  to be willing for the sacrifice and pain of being true saints is the knowledge that we don't want to suffer
32:44 -  an eternal chagrin, an eternal disappointment
32:50 -  that we have lived beneath the glory of God and have chosen a mode of Christian life and experience
32:56 -  that is comfortable, does not threaten and does not test. Because eternity,
33:02 -  the issue of eternity is part of the consciousness of such a body, it will act in a way
33:08 -  sacrificially in a way that others would not be willing
33:14 -  to experience. So, its intercessions, like its prayer
33:24 -  and its worship, are authentic and are a travail of the spirit because
33:30 -  it measures and is the statement of the truth of its own life together.
33:36 -  And that kind of reality and that kind of life together not only affects the worship of such
33:42 -  a body, the praise of such a body, the intercession of such a body, but the discernment of such a body.
33:48 -  It's much more acute in its discernments. It's much more able to sift and to separate
33:54 -  the kinds of things that beguile or trap Christians who are more shallow and naive.
34:02 -  And it discerns and recognizes the whole issue of the powers of the air
34:08 -  and the necessity to wrestle against them who are the rulers of this world's darkness in the very locality
34:14 -  where they are. Paul says in Ephesians 6, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
34:20 -  the principalities and powers of the other ruling powers of this world's darkness.
34:26 -  It's a we that wrestle. Wrestle is ultimate confrontation, ultimate battle,
34:32 -  ultimate giving of yourself in a spiritual way that defeats them.
34:40 -  But there's a we that has to perform it. It's not the conduct or the activity of individual virtuoso saints,
34:46 -  but a church that recognizes the configuration of powers that are above them and will do
34:52 -  battle in the realm of spirit in a depth of prayer that is relative to
34:58 -  its own reality. And we had two breakthroughs in this way at Ben Israel
35:04 -  that will forever remain in my memory from our proximity to the Indian
35:10 -  tribe, the what tribe are they? Chippewa.
35:16 -  Having their annual powwow and we came to our morning prayer meeting hung over
35:22 -  with a sense of depression, which if I were living by myself, I would have thought, this is me, this is
35:28 -  Katz, this is the temperamental Jew, this is the one given to moods. But when you see the entire body
35:34 -  is experiencing a sense of oppression, you know that there's something working in the air that is beyond the
35:40 -  issue of your personal temperament. And then you gather yourself together and gird your lines and do
35:46 -  battle against that presence. And in that time of intense prayer that you would have thought, had you walked
35:52 -  into it, this is an insane asylum, people are batting at the air, people are prostrate, the exercise in every posture
35:58 -  of battle together I saw the face of the enemy at first leaving down upon
36:04 -  us with contempt, as if to say oh, Ben Israel, they're nothing, they're ridden with problems, but as the
36:10 -  truth of the prayer, the depth and the intensity and the corporateness of this prayer
36:16 -  went up, that expression on that face changed from contempt to fear, those lips began
36:22 -  to tremble, that entity backed off, and we were pursuing and that thing broke in panic and
36:28 -  ran at the truth of what was coming forth, because the only thing that the powers of the air
36:34 -  are required to see, to acknowledge, is authenticity, reality,
36:40 -  the truth of God in the church. Jesus they know for that reason,
36:46 -  and Paul they know for that reason, and for that reason they'll know us also if we have come in for that reason
36:52 -  corporately and together or not at all. Got the idea? So,
37:04 -  the character of this body is tempered, disciplined, sacrificial, as I have mentioned.
37:10 -  It is authentically and unfeignedly submitted to authority, resident
37:16 -  in the body, which is identified by anointing and call and not by ecclesiastical office
37:22 -  or humanly or religiously obtained credentials. The issue of authority,
37:28 -  its recognition and the submission to such is critical to the whole character of a body of that kind.
37:34 -  If we continue to be autonomous, self-willed, individualities who will come for Sunday
37:40 -  but make our own decisions, our own plans, our own programs, and not even notify or ask
37:46 -  what do you feel about this by taking this leave? Is this a critical time?
37:52 -  Is this a critical time? Do I have a blessing? Do you sense? The powers of darkness
38:02 -  will know to what degree we are submitted to the Lord. And if that submission is only superficial, if we have
38:10 -  insulated ourselves from it, if there's something in us that does not want to come under an authority
38:16 -  because we see its defect which will always be present, that we'll never find an authority
38:22 -  that is free of it, then that body lacks the apostolic character that commands
38:28 -  the respect and the acknowledgement of the powers of darkness. We've got to take the risk
38:34 -  of a submission even into authorities whose lives we see are lacking in one aspect or
38:40 -  another, and in fact always will continue to lack, except they be with us in the reality
38:46 -  of a body by which not only are the sheep ministered to in their need, but also the
38:52 -  shepherds. We have no excuse to withhold our submission to the authority
38:58 -  that God has invested in the body through men. And it's an authority that is expressed
39:04 -  through an anointing, through call, and as I've said, not through a religious ordination
39:10 -  obtained by ecclesiastical credentials that necessarily
39:16 -  establishes that. The true measure and test of whether we have come to the reality to which God is calling us
39:22 -  is the attitude of our own children toward it. Do the kids themselves
39:32 -  sense that what we are about as adults is worthy not only of their attention, but of their participation?
39:38 -  Or are they only hanging onto our skirts out of a necessity that we require of
39:44 -  them? In a word, have we come to a place where the reality that we have generated consistently
39:50 -  has impressed them as being worthy of their own participation and is not just an adult culture
39:56 -  that we enjoy almost at their expense? We can tell the degree to which this reality has
40:02 -  come by looking at our teenagers and seeing to what degree they are impressed.
40:10 -  That's why we have to feed them programs and various other alternatives
40:16 -  in some way to hold them in some kind of relationship because
40:22 -  the reality that God intends that would have brought their participation
40:28 -  has not been provided because we are unwilling for the totality of the consecration
40:34 -  that such a body requires. Our children are showing us in their displeasure,
40:40 -  in their irritation, do I have to go that we have not met God's measure and have
40:46 -  no intention of doing so? The children recognize and respect and reflect the reality
40:58 -  and urgency of the participation of the family in the endeavors
41:04 -  to which they have given themselves. Because the body is imbued with an apostolic
41:10 -  and cosmic understanding. The German word Weltanschauung, it has a worldview,
41:16 -  it has a perception of a reality of which it sees itself as a significant part
41:22 -  and considers everything in the light of this reality and of eternity as I've already
41:28 -  mentioned. So much as if it should be necessary,
41:34 -  it would take its strippings with joy. Paul speaks in Hebrews 10
41:40 -  of those who took their stripping with joy, knowing in themselves that they had a
41:46 -  recompense in heaven of a greater kind. You can be assured that if we make a determination of this
41:52 -  kind, we're likely to experience stripping of one kind or another as has been already my experience
41:58 -  up at the farm when the brother whom I entrusted the property taking him out of a
42:04 -  hut with a pig and two dogs and giving him a roof and a place
42:10 -  by which we had acquired in a year and a half seven horses and leather harnesses and equipment that could be
42:16 -  used in agriculture without the necessity for diesel equipment or fuel
42:22 -  was altogether removed in one fell swoop when I came back from a trip
42:28 -  after he had called me to say I'm leaving what should I take? I thought well
42:34 -  you came with nothing you've labored I thought maybe we'll take half of what we have
42:40 -  accumulated and the brother with me says let him take what he thinks is right I said take what you think is right
42:46 -  I came home to find every horse gone, every vehicle gone, every tool
42:52 -  gone, not a nut, a bolt, a screw plier, screwdriver even the rope that had pulled the hay up to the
42:58 -  loft for forty years before this brother came he took that also and the boards upon which the horses stood and
43:04 -  urinated he took those also in a word we were stripped and the remarkable thing is he was helped
43:10 -  by local believers to cut all these things out in fact there's a brother in the room today whose brother was
43:16 -  one who helped and completely oblivious that this guy was taking more than could be his due
43:22 -  when I saw that we had been stripped upon my return the thing that welled up in me was an instant
43:28 -  anger and resentment in which God said that's a no-no take your strippings with joy
43:34 -  knowing in yourself this is not casual knowledge creedal knowledge, doctoral knowledge
43:40 -  this is internal, existential awareness and a reality of heaven and its rewards
43:46 -  that make our present losses momentary and light this will characterize
43:52 -  a fellowship of this kind and God will allow us to be tested in the area of possessions, reputation
43:58 -  the various kinds of things in which we can find ourselves stripped
44:06 -  doesn't this sound very much like the context of the apostolic scriptures themselves
44:12 -  in the book of acts, yes we're being restored to that environment that was at the first
44:18 -  which means that our bible studies will no longer be an interesting use of scripture for the enjoyment
44:24 -  and the delight of insight and revelatory things that come from it that we enjoy hearing, but that the bible
44:30 -  studies henceforth will be moved into a realm of urgency as if they are epistles
44:36 -  written for us who are living on the sharp edge of extremity and facing the last days, encounters
44:42 -  and confrontations that the church knew in its first days bible study as a harmless
44:48 -  weekday occupation is the measure to which we have moved
44:54 -  from the apostolic context and into something of another kind when we will come back again
45:00 -  to the realities that the church knew at the first the epistles the word of God will have for us
45:06 -  a cogency and a power and a penetration and an urgency that they do not presently have
45:12 -  we will have moved from bible study to instruction in the way of those who are on the cutting edge
45:18 -  of God's last days purpose listen, everything I'm putting before you is initial choice
45:28 -  it needs to be made willful taken upon ourselves with joy
45:34 -  because it strives for the eternal reward and crown and does not even consider
45:40 -  martyrdom a dread thing but a privilege even invoking the word
45:46 -  martyrdom in June of 2001 in Phoenix Arizona
45:52 -  you might as well have invented some play on syllables a nonsense word
45:58 -  as to speak the word martyrdom in this present society, life and time
46:04 -  and yet dear saints if this age does not end in that reality, I will be
46:10 -  the most deceived of all men and if I myself shall find my life ending in a bed
46:16 -  rather in a climactic violent conclusion I will be utterly astonished and amazed
46:22 -  I think that the anticipation of martyrdom is not some far-fetched romantic contemplation
46:28 -  but a realistic apprehension of what will likely be the consequence of this kind of consecration
46:34 -  in the last days there are already men speaking about they are within the body of Christ
46:42 -  between the blue and the grey the blue being those that are heavenly minded and see every revival
46:48 -  coming down the pike from Toronto to anywhere as being the now work of God
46:54 -  but those who are anyway critical or dubious and do not give themselves in totality instantly
47:00 -  are considered the grey they are the subrival they are the ones who function out of their minds rather than their spirits
47:06 -  and as one writer has suggested such a conflict at the civil war between blue and grey
47:12 -  will take place itself in the church listen dear saints there will come a time when they will kill us
47:18 -  and claim they are doing God a service I'm hearing such threats now so the whole lifestyle
47:28 -  of such a body is the outworking of this mindset has the resonance of such
47:34 -  a consecration as one that has already been made and is constantly
47:40 -  consistently maintained it's a it's in a conscious continuum
47:46 -  with the apostolic past it believes that there is a cloud of invisible witnesses over it
47:52 -  as I have prayed even for this morning can you humor me that I'm so naive
47:58 -  that I would believe and have called for and asked God to have over us this morning
48:04 -  a cloud of invisible witnesses those who have been in this locality
48:10 -  or in this state or in this America or who have suffered opposition fiercely
48:16 -  physically even unto death for that which was not a reward in their own life
48:22 -  and are not yet complete without us this isn't romanticism this is definitive apostolic
48:28 -  thinking, understanding believing and expecting because it's not mere observers
48:34 -  that the invisible cloud of witnesses are not idly looking upon us with a curiosity to see what we will do
48:40 -  they are actually bringing I believe a dimension from the eschatological side
48:46 -  the eternal future already into our affairs
48:52 -  they are a presence, they bring something as much as intercesses and the church that is
48:58 -  on line with God who needs the employment of all of God's
49:06 -  precious provision will frequently if not consistently be calling for and asking
49:12 -  the presence of an invisible cloud of witnesses over that will bring an exertion of something from the eschatological
49:18 -  side that will move us on to the conclusion without which they themselves are not made perfect
49:24 -  so either deliberations like this off the wall
49:30 -  and you're losing reality or it is uttermost reality take your pick
49:36 -  I'm saying that this is definitive reality and God is waiting for a church
49:42 -  that will desire and choose it thank you my God well
49:50 -  more than can be said but that's enough for now so I want to pray
49:58 -  for the the plumb line that has come down through this word
50:08 -  and a determination of those who are hearing it to choose it and to bring a consecration
50:14 -  appropriate to its fulfillment it's clear even to the dullest saint and to the most immature
50:22 -  naive and young that the kind of thing that has been outlined here
50:28 -  means ultimate requirement puts you in a place of ultimate opposition
50:34 -  requires ultimate sacrifice because it has ultimate purpose and ultimate mandate
50:42 -  and ultimate calling so Lord I'm praying that your word will not go forth
50:48 -  void that it will not be vain that it will not be dismissed
50:54 -  as a Sunday morning's curiosity as some kind of aimless rambling of a
51:00 -  hypothetical kind that is interesting to hear but does not make any requirements
51:06 -  I'm praying Lord it will make a requirement surely we shall not attain to the reality that makes
51:12 -  the church the church and Israel's salvific agent except by a conscious
51:18 -  truthful choosing of these things and so I pray blessing my God upon
51:24 -  this body that it has pleased you to drop a word of this kind here
51:32 -  and however strange or ambiguous some of the statements have been made that cannot be instantly understood
51:38 -  let the spirit my God of those truths go into their heart
51:44 -  and find its way to their understanding and to their yielding
51:50 -  their consecration their saying yes Lord we bless you my God for the privilege
51:56 -  of being such a presence in the earth in these last days surely everything
52:02 -  about it is at odds with the environment everywhere about us in this
52:08 -  Arizona of all the places my God in which a soul can be traduced and beguiled
52:14 -  in which we can be lulled into areas of comfort and resignation
52:20 -  it's this place this will take therefore conscious willful choosing
52:26 -  it will choose its reality it will say we will steep our eyeballs not on the beauty that
52:32 -  surround us physically in this world but in what is spoken in the scripture as being definitive
52:38 -  and certainly the truth of the last days and the conclusion of the age and we want to be
52:44 -  prepared for that so we bless you Lord precious
52:50 -  God on high Lord my God transact with the people
52:56 -  whose yes you have obtained that you can bring forth those
53:02 -  things that will shape its corporate life and make the powers of the air who have so long prevailed
53:08 -  over this phoenix over this Jewish community over the state over this nation
53:14 -  uncontested to sit up take notice to be alarmed to tremble
53:22 -  to oppose this very reality be triumphant my God through that
53:28 -  people we pray we thank and give you praise for the privilege of it in Jesus name.
