Apostolic Foundations

00:00 -  We have been speaking on apostolic foundations. True apostolicity. What is this particular thing?
00:15 -  How is it to be defined and understood? It's a critical and a key word. And we have been carefully proceeding for the two occasions to begin to explore it.
00:36 -  It deserves our deepest attention. But we began to be aware that what is apostolic is ultimate. That's the very nature of the thing.
00:55 -  It's ultimate in its requirement. It has an ultimate view of God and His purposes. An ultimate sense of eternity in time.
01:15 -  It's passionate about the ultimate issues of God. The day of the Lord and His soon coming wrath, His judgment. The Lord's own coming.
01:32 -  The kinds of things which have become only doctrine or concepts in our time. To which we subscribe as being correct. But we have lost the power of it.
01:51 -  The dynamic of the apostolic perception of these things. Which needs to be reclaimed and to be restored. Because the church that is no longer apostolic is no longer the church.
02:10 -  I realize that I take a risk in making such a statement. Because I believe that you even have a denomination with that word apostolic in this country. Not in the German though.
02:22 -  Because I believe that you even have a denomination with that name here in this country. Everything conspires against us. Every power in hell and in the world is bent against the proclamation of apostolic things.
02:39 -  Every power in hell and in the world is bent against apostolic things. The restoration of apostolic reality. For what it ultimately is.
02:54 -  It's not a set of correct concepts. It's a vital and powerful faith. That if you subscribe to it in truth.
03:12 -  It will make you mad. It's beyond foolishness. It will condemn you to being a stranger, a pilgrim and a sojourner in the earth.
03:25 -  Now in this generation. Not only in the world. But Christendom itself.
03:35 -  It's so radical. We came to a point in the last meeting. Where I sensed the futility of going on.
03:46 -  Where I sensed that it was pointless to go on. My own faith was stretched to breaking. My own faith was stretched to breaking.
03:57 -  I found it difficult to believe that such things could be understood by a Swiss audience today. I found it difficult to believe that such things could be understood by a Swiss audience today. To believe it seriously.
04:11 -  Or even just wish it. Not only should we be such a community at the end of this age. Which should again walk in this authority and power.
04:28 -  And I asked a question at the end of this evening. And I think it was divinely inspired. It wasn't part of my own thought.
04:38 -  Do we have an apostolic intention? Because if we don't have that. If we don't desire the reality of what is apostolic.
04:49 -  If we don't desire the reality of what is apostolic. What is the purpose of the examination of that subject? And this is what I sensed in my spirit.
05:00 -  We really do not have that intent. We don't want as a people to go that far. We don't want as a people to go that far.
05:10 -  We have unconsciously at least set limitations. We have unconsciously at least set limitations. We are willing to be serious and responsible Christians.
05:20 -  We are willing to be serious and responsible Christians. We are willing to give ourselves to a degree. We are willing to give ourselves to a degree.
05:29 -  But that which is apostolic. But that which is apostolic. Is ultimate.
05:38 -  And requires everything. So that's the title of tonight's final message. And that's the title of today's final message.
05:47 -  Apostolic intention. Do we have that apostolic intention? Because even in our own conversations across the street
06:01 -  we were touching very interesting points of agreement and disagreement. We were touching very interesting points of agreement and disagreement. What do I myself represent to these children?
06:11 -  What do I myself represent to these children? Which I've known for 10 years? How am I perceived by them?
06:20 -  And the kind of message that I bear? Even with the advantage of our long relationships? Even with the advantage of our long relationships?
06:29 -  Am I a curiosity? Am I a kind of a quaint feature in the body of Christ? Am I a kind of a quaint feature in the body of Christ?
06:38 -  As someone whom we can afford to hear from time to time? As someone whom we can afford to hear from time to time? But not too frequently.
06:47 -  And it's interesting to hear. But it's not intended to be taken totally seriously. But it's not intended to be taken totally seriously.
06:56 -  It's really something that will bring us into a greater balance. It's really something that will bring us into a greater balance. It's a counterbalancing message.
07:05 -  It's a counterbalancing message. But not something to believe in for itself, exclusively and alone. But not something to believe in for itself, exclusively and alone.
07:14 -  That would be madness. That would not only unfit us for the world, That would not only unfit us for the world,
07:23 -  That would unfit us for Christendom. And so we have been struggling with this issue. And so we have been struggling with this issue.
07:32 -  And so we have been struggling with this issue. And I raised the same question that I'm raising now with you. Is this apostolic and prophetic thing merely an option?
07:42 -  Is this apostolic and prophetic thing merely an option? Is this apostolic and prophetic thing merely an option? Or is it the definitive and normative intent
07:51 -
07:51 -  Or is it the definitive and normative intent Or is it the definitive and normative intent Or is it the definitive and normative intent
07:51 -  Or is it the definitive and normative intent
07:51 -   Or is it the definitive and normal intent
07:51 -
07:51 -  Or is it the definitive and normal intent Or is it the definitive and final decision
07:56 -
07:56 -
07:56 -
07:56 -
07:56 -
07:56 -
07:56 -    for God and his community in every generation?
08:02 -  How do we see our own Christian life? And with whom are we identifying? I want to spend a little time in the book of Hebrews tonight,
08:15 -  beginning with Abraham in chapter 11, the heroes of the faith, and try to be reminded by that of an unbroken continuum of the faith,
08:37 -  that in fact even tonight we are surrounded by the invisible cloud of their witnesses. Do we have the apostolic sense to see that? That they are waiting for something who are not complete and perfect without us,
08:58 -  for which they sacrificed and died, right here in the Zurich area. Their blood was shed,
09:11 -  and they were drowned in your river. But is that also a mere historical curiosity that has faded from the consciousness and memory of the church,
09:24 -  but is powerfully alive with God? So Lord, I ask your blessing tonight, as we have prayed through this day,
09:36 -  to present this view takes an unusual power from God, for we know that all hell resists and opposes it,
09:47 -  that is not at all disturbed by our charismatic preferences, but is terrified of this, lest this be revived,
10:00 -  for we know that all hell resists and opposes it, but is terrified of this, lest this be revived,
10:11 -  and characterized again the church of the end, as it did the church of the glorious beginning. Grant us grace tonight, Lord.
10:23 -  Great grace to present this view and require from us a response in keeping with the character of your speaking,
10:35 -  which is the same as your words, we ask an event in God for this nation's sake,
10:46 -  for a dying world, for Jesus' sake. In your name we pray. Amen.
10:58 -  Chapter 11, verse 8, By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance,
11:09 -  and he went out not knowing. I hope I'm not going to be carried away by my own desire. Already it deserves such a comment.
11:21 -  Already with the explosive introduction we are brought into a whole perception of apostolic faith. We are brought into a whole perception of apostolic faith.
11:32 -  Already with this introduction we are brought into an explosion, into an outbreak of apostolic faith,
11:44 -  which is offered to us by an invisible God in another land, which requires a radical separation,
11:56 -  not just from the evil of the Ur of the Chaldeans, not just what is vile in Babylonian culture, but even the things that are good,
12:07 -  that we would endorse, nation, kindred and father's house. That's the very point of apostolic beginning,
12:22 -  and few there be that have made it, who recognize that Abraham's call is our call, if indeed we have apostolic intent,
12:33 -  in a land that he will show us, though we go forth not knowing, what a calculated attack on the German mentality.
12:45 -  What a calculated attack on the German mentality. I should say the Jewish mentality. I should say the Jewish mentality.
12:56 -  It's the same thing. It's a mentality that needs to know, must have assurance and security and confidence,
13:08 -  determines its conduct and its response on the basis of its analytical and rational evaluation, that will never do.
13:19 -  That will never do, apostolicly. You have to leave your Swiss-German-Jewish identity in the Ur of the Chaldeans,
13:31 -  and go forth not knowing, suffering all of the insecurity that that implies, because God has called,
13:43 -  and what are we to say? And what are we to say? The fact that we can even consider other options.
13:54 -  Can't I be a lesser saint? Isn't it enough to be charismatic? Or Pentecostal?
14:10 -  God is God. And He says He would have us to be separate. Get the out
14:21 -  is the very first principle of apostolic reality. Don't even touch the unclean thing. And I will receive you
14:33 -  and be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and my daughters. How we need the experience of the fatherhood of God. If we are to walk so radically
14:44 -  in the face of such human insecurity. I wish I had the luxury not even to have to leave this point under discussion.
14:56 -  That we could stay with this one point the rest of the night. It deserves that investment. But that's not the point.
15:07 -  It deserves that investment. But that itself is a commentary. That it would strike us as some new thing.
15:19 -  As some kind of radical innovation. As some deep principle that they were considering for the first time.
15:31 -  When it should have been normative to our faith from the beginning. I tell you that if there's anything that sounds radical the fault lies not with God or with His word.
15:42 -  It's a statement of the measure to which we have drifted from the normative faith. That we consider it with trembling
15:54 -  making such a requirement. By faith He lived as an alien in the land of promise as in a foreign land.
16:05 -  By faith He lived as an alien in the land of promise as in a foreign land. Thrilling in tents with Isaac and Jacob
16:17 -  the fellow heirs of the same promise. Those who were not yet born. The patriarchs of the faith
16:28 -  were already united with Abraham in this fundamental change. But are we also united? Because the character of it is to live as an alien
16:40 -  even in the land of promise. Even in Christianity. There's a certain sense of strangeness about yourself.
16:52 -  There's an ultimacy about your life in God. This is something final, final in your life with God that discomforts others who are sincere Christians
17:03 -  and makes you to feel a sense of being strange and different than others. He was looking for the city whose foundation and builder is God
17:19 -  whom He expected, the city whose foundation and builder is God and who is the creator and creator of God. And that was the vision and sight of every apostolic saint from the beginning.
17:36 -  In verse 13, all who are blind in faith and have never received the promises, but have seen them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles in the earth.
17:50 -  To have an apostolic intention is to condemn yourself to being strange. Not just in the world again, I say,
18:02 -  but even in the land of promise, even in the realms of Christendom, there is a sense of being strange,
18:14 -  even in the realms of Christendom, there is a sense of being strange, of exiled, of being alone.
18:25 -  It says, they who say such things make it clear that they are seeking another country. Something has got to rise to the level of consciousness,
18:37 -  the level of explicit choice. The level of explicit choice, the level of the clear decision
18:48 -  as expressed in a confession, a choice to be a pilgrim, a stranger and an exile in the earth. To be a pilgrim, a stranger and an exile on this earth.
19:02 -  This is so outside of our experience, so contrary to everything that is human and warm. So contrary to everything that is human and warm.
19:14 -  We desperately want to be approved of men. We need their affirmation and their love. Even as Christians.
19:26 -  But to stand outside of that, to be marked as strange, because you are going another measure further than most.
19:38 -  A final and an ultimate measure. An apostolic measure that opens the whole prospect
19:49 -  of a new power and a new authority to serve. These are they that turn the world upside down. These are they that turn the world upside down.
20:01 -  That makes the powers of darkness to tremble because they know what is in our hearts and how far we have resolved to go with God.
20:12 -  And how far we have resolved to go with God. They are not impressed with our vocabulary, our amens, our hallelujahs,
20:24 -  or our activities. They look for this. What is the intent of the heart? How far is it willing to go with God?
20:35 -  Yes, Jesus knows it, and Paul knows it. But the church of Zürich, who? Something happens.
20:47 -  A threshold is crossed. A new prospect for life and services is opened. But with it also a new kind of opposition,
20:59 -  a new kind of struggle, in the night hours, with powers of darkness
21:10 -  who had not had to torment you before. You have made yourself a candidate because you are furiously and fiercely opposed
21:22 -  into the realm in which you have come. There is a power and a God available to you that terrifies their interests.
21:33 -  But it does not come cheaply. It is available only for one class of believers, the Abrahamic class,
21:45 -  the patriarchal class, of which the Anabaptists in Switzerland were part.
21:56 -  Who had the vision of the same faith, the same walk, the same absoluteness before God,
22:08 -  the same utterness toward God, that automatically made them an enemy of society and even of the reformed church,
22:20 -  who could not tolerate for them to live. Because they represented a threatening alternative of another quality of life and power
22:31 -  that instantly revealed the fraud of state church religion, saints of whom the world was not worthy,
22:43 -  saints of whom the world was not worthy, saints of whom the world was not worthy, saints of whom the world was not worthy,
22:54 -  do we consciously choose to join them? I do not care what our religious origins were. I do not care what our religious origins were.
23:06 -  This is a matter of hearing a call, being separate, and coming out,
23:17 -  not knowing, condemning yourself to be an exile, a stranger, a pilgrim, an alien in the earth.
23:29 -  It can happen tonight, that by an act of our own choosing, we can be inserted into the unbroken continuum of the faith.
23:41 -  We can be inserted into the unbroken continuum of the faith. The apostolic, the ultimate faith, from its beginning
23:52 -  until its soon conclusion, do we desire to go that far? Do we desire to go that far?
24:04 -  Some people look at me as if I am one who has made that commitment. They look at me with admiration as if I have some special grace for that,
24:15 -  not knowing that my struggle is exactly as you own. not knowing that my struggle is exactly as you own. And I shared with these children today
24:27 -  how I had a conversation in Minnesota with my wife and with Gary, and I was so disgusted with her. She married a teacher, but she got a preacher.
24:38 -  She married a teacher, but she got a preacher. And a kind that will embarrass a wife. And bring humiliation.
24:50 -  And she wasn't quite sure whether she really wants that kind of Christianity. Can't she be, she asked, a normal Christian?
25:02 -  Like everybody else? Why must she, because of her husband, be required to this kind of ultimacy and radicalness of faith?
25:13 -  And I got so impatient of hearing that from her. And I got so impatient of hearing that from her. And I got up from the table and I walked away.
25:25 -  I was afraid of what I would say. And finally our time with her was finished. Gary and I went on in the car.
25:36 -  And I'll never forget it. I was full of indignation. Anger, impatience.
25:48 -  I said, this is it. I've had it. I just can't go on with this. This is too much. To have patience for such a woman.
25:59 -  Such a desire and such a fight. And I know that God can use it. That it is glorified and perfected and perfected.
26:11 -  But I don't want it. What do we long for now? Can't I be a lesser kind of saint?
26:23 -  That doesn't have to be brought to such a perfection. And the moment I said that, I realized that I was saying exactly the same thing.
26:34 -  And therefore I suspect we have all been saying the same thing. We don't want to go that far. We don't want to bear that requirement.
26:46 -  That suffering. Can't we be normal Christians? If you can.
26:57 -  It's a question of choosing to hear the call of God. It's the question that we decide to hear the call of God. And being placed in that unbroken continuum of faith.
27:09 -  And being placed in that untissued framework of faith. Of those who in every generation have been exiles, sojourners and pilgrims in the earth.
27:20 -  Who had an opportunity to return. But they desired a better country. A heavenly one.
27:31 -  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. For he has prepared a city for them. Not just an ultimate place of communion with God.
27:45 -  Not just the ultimate place of communion with God. The New Jerusalem which comes down from above. The Mount Zion of God.
27:57 -  But he has prepared a place for them. And a grace for them. And an enablement for them.
28:07 -  Who choose to go that far. Who is sufficient for these things? If apostolic seeing is anything, it is seeing as God sees.
28:38 -  If apostolic seeing is anything, it is seeing as God sees. He is not limited by the concept of past, present, future. Nothing has changed.
28:54 -  The issues are eternally the same. And he sees things in a flow and in a continuum. That's what we read at the end of this chapter.
29:06 -  That God has provided something better for us so that they, apart from us, should not be made perfect. Who is the they? Those who were stoned, who were sawn in two, who were tried, who were put to death with a sword, who went about in sheep skins, who hid in caves and in holes of the rock.
29:33 -  Those who were stoned, burned, failed, who came about in swords, who went about in sheep skins, who were hungry, drunken, naked. And that which they began yet waits for completion. Through us who are in continuity with them.
29:56 -  That they should not be made perfect without us. What a remarkable incentive for those of us who would not welcome such a walk just for ourselves alone. Even Elijah had to cry out in his moments of despair and disillusionment.
30:20 -  This is enough for me already. Am I better than my fathers? Take my life. Elijah even called out in his bad times and said, this is enough for me now. I am ready to die. What my fathers did is enough. There are powers that want so to discourage us from this walk.
30:38 -  To get us to satisfy ourselves with some lesser thing. To bring us here that we are with something less perfect. But to know that they without us are not made perfect.
30:50 -  Brings us into an obligation and an incentive that is beyond us. That it is not just the issue of our faith for ourselves. But also for them.
31:05 -  Whose blood has been shed here on these shores. This is apostolic seeing. To see this unbroken continuum.
31:18 -  Moving toward a conclusion. With us, if we walk in the same quality of faith. Have the same ultimate intention with God.
31:32 -  That will require of us to be exiles and strangers and pilgrims in the land. That's why chapter 12 begins with the word therefore. Therefore, since we have such so great a cloud of witnesses.
31:51 -  And not just great in number. But great in greatness. Great in sacrifice.
32:03 -  Great in apostolic character. Great in purity of faith and of heart. Great witnesses.
32:11 -  Since we have so great a cloud. We have it. Therefore, it brings a special requirement.
32:22 -  Let us lay aside every encumbrance and the sin that so easily besets us. Doesn't tell us what that sin is. But be assured we have it.
32:35 -  Or it may be different for each of us. But I have never heard anyone until tonight talk about the encumbrance. The encumbrance that precedes it.
32:46 -  Let us lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily besets us. I have never heard anyone talk about the burden mentioned here. The burden and the light around us.
32:57 -  I want to talk to you about the encumbrance. That weight of things. That worldly involvement.
33:05 -  That laziness of spirit. That surrender to domestic things. That is every bit as much an obstacle as sin.
33:19 -  It is an encumbrance. A weight. That comes from our ambition.
33:27 -  Of vanity. Of fear. Our involvement in nation, kindred and father's house.
33:36 -  Our engagement in the nation, in the environment, in the father's house. God says, lay it aside. Therefore, if not for your own sake.
33:46 -  If not for yourself. For their sake. Who were before you.
33:52 -  Of whom the world was not worthy. Who were cut in two and sown asunder. Who were burned at the stake.
33:58 -  Who hid in dens and rocks and holes and caves. Who hid in holes and caves. Who are waiting.
34:06 -  Even in this room tonight. An invisible cloud that is great. Whose sacrifice will not be perfected.
34:15 -  Without us. Who freely and willfully choose to identify with them. And complete what they began.
34:25 -  By exactly the same kind of intention. Which will likely mean for us what it meant for them. Opposition.
34:37 -  Reproach. Persecution. Being driven out.
34:43 -  Exiled. Something we could hardly imagine in our present mode of life. Something we could hardly imagine in our present mode of life.
34:54 -  Something we could hardly imagine in our present mode of life. It raises a question. Am I being melodramatic tonight?
35:07 -  Am I being melodramatic tonight? Am I raising some kind of idealistic alternative for the few? Am I raising some kind of idealistic alternative for the few?
35:24 -  Those who have a bit of feeling for the spiritual hero. When was this Hebrew letter written? To some minority within the church.
35:41 -  Or to the remnant of God. To the remnant of God. The church within the church.
35:48 -  The true people of God in every generation. The true people of God in every generation. And especially the last.
36:07 -  The thing that encourages me to believe that God is not speaking about some rare and special minority. The thing that encourages me to believe that God is not speaking about some rare and special minority. But is addressing the church, the true church.
36:21 -  But is addressing the church, the true church. And that this is the normative and definitive faith for the church in every age. And that this is the normative and definitive faith for the church in every age.
36:32 -  Is the way the chapter goes on. Is the way the chapter goes on. But you have come, it says in verse 22, to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God.
36:40 -  But you have come, it says in verse 22, to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God. But you have come, it says in verse 22, to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God. I am fully convinced that this is the same city from which Abraham is success.
36:55 -  This architect, builder, builder is God himself. When you seek that city, you will never be satisfied with Zurich.
37:05 -  You will never be satisfied with Zurich. The heavenly Jerusalem and to myriads of angels and to the general assembly and church of the firstborn
37:18 -  and to the myriads of angels and to the general assembly and church of the firstborn the general assembly, the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven.
37:40 -  To the spirits of righteous men, made perfect, verse 23. To the spirits of righteous men, made perfect, verse 23. I don't know what it is about that that so offends men.
37:55 -  I don't know what it is about that that so offends men. Even ministers. So I was reminded today as I was sharing with them about an episode I had in London.
38:05 -  So I was reminded today as I was sharing with them about an episode I had in London. Just being obedient and speaking a word that God gave me at a Pentecostal church. In a church where I was simply obedient and spoke out a word that God gave me.
38:18 -  And such a cry of God came out of that congregation in an utterance in tongue by the spirit. And such a scream came out of this assembly through a tongue speech afterwards. Almost shrieking to arrest the attention of the people who were hearing but resisting.
38:31 -  Almost shrieking to arrest the attention of the people who were hearing but resisting. And when we left that church at the end that night, the pastor was at the door saying goodbye to people.
38:45 -  And when I came up to him, he broke out in a rage toward me. And when I came up to him, he broke out in a rage toward me. He said, do you believe that we have to be perfect?
38:55 -  And I was stupefied. And I was stupefied. I didn't even use the word in my message.
39:04 -  And yet in his own understanding somehow there was a link of connection. And indeed there is. To the spirits of just men made perfect.
39:18 -  Do we have that apostolic intention? Or are you more American than you know? Or are you more American than you know?
39:31 -  And do you just want to get by? This is the real national slogan of my country. This is the national slogan of my country.
39:41 -  That's what my students used to ask me at the beginning of every school year. That's what my students asked me at the beginning of every school year. Mr. Katz, what is the minimum amount that we need to do in order to get by?
39:50 -  Mr. Katz, what is the minimum amount that we need to achieve in order to get by? They might make nice conventional Christians. Occupying pews and even putting their dollar in the collection plate.
40:04 -  They might even go out on an outreach. But they will not in any way threaten the powers that brood over our lands. There is a God who wants us to be made perfect.
40:20 -  There is a God who wants us to be made perfect. There is a God who wants us to be made perfect. So that they, apart from us, should not be made perfect.
40:30 -  So that they, apart from us, should not be made perfect. That's a painful making. That's a painful sanctifying process.
40:41 -  That is part of the pilgrim walk. That is part of the pilgrim walk. And will make one a stranger and an exile if they choose it.
40:51 -  And will make us cry out who is sufficient for these things. And will make us cry out who is sufficient for these things. But when have we asked that last?
41:04 -  Really asked it. Had to ask it. What is there in our normative Christian experience
41:13 -  that brings us to such a place that we have to cry out who is sufficient? What is there in our normative Christian experience that brings us to such a place that we have to cry out who is sufficient?
41:24 -  The truth of the matter is that for our present Christianity we are quite sufficient. But just make one decision But just make one decision
41:35 -  for an apostolic intention of an ultimate quality of faith of an ultimate quality of faith
41:43 -  that can confront the Greek spirit of this world on Mars Hill that can confront the Greek spirit of this world on Mars Hill and tell them that God commands all men now everywhere to repent.
41:54 -  And tell them that God commands all men now everywhere to repent. For God has appointed a day in which he will judge all men. For God has appointed a day in which he will judge all men.
42:02 -  That one whom he has raised from the dead. Try speaking that at Mars Hill today.
42:09 -  At Mars Hill today. The issue of judgment. The wrath of the lamb to come.
42:16 -  The wrath of the lamb to come. That God requires repentance. That God commands it.
42:24 -  And you'll never feel more foolish. And you'll never feel more foolish. More inadequate.
42:31 -  More powerless. But it's to these things that we're called. But who is sufficient for these things?

43:44 -  Who also had to endure the cross. Who also had to endure the cross. And despise the shame.
43:50 -  And despise the shame. Why should we set our eyes upon him? Why should we set our eyes upon him?
43:56 -  Because by the same grace that was available to him, Because by the same grace that was available to him, Because by the same grace that was available to him,
44:05 -  there is a grace available to us, to run the race set before us, and to finish the course.

45:20 -  Where the issues are life and death. And eternity hangs in the balance. And eternity hangs everywhere.
45:26 -  On every occasion. Even tonight. You are going too far.
45:32 -  This is just a nice meeting in the suburb of Zurich. This is just a nice meeting in the suburb of Zurich. This is not a life and death situation.
45:39 -  This is not a life or death situation. Eternity is not at stake tonight. Eternity is not at stake tonight.
45:45 -  You see how you do not see apostolically? You see how you do not see apostolically? That is the very substance of apostolic saying.

46:14 -  I am not going to be invited back again at Lausanne to speak on the subject of the Israeli Church. The destiny of Israel is at stake. The Jews of this nation or those who will come to them in flight.
46:27 -  Or those who will come to them in flight. If there should be a global persecution, which I expect. And if the church is not prepared for it.
46:35 -  And is still unconsciously anti-Semitic. And is still unconsciously anti-Semitic. And does not even know it is true Hathor, the Jew.
46:42 -  And does not even know it is true Hathor, the Jew. And does not even know it is true Hathor, the Jew. It is going to be a scandalous failure.

47:14 -  Or your savings. Or your savings. The various things that continue to weigh upon our spirits.
47:21 -  All these different things that are always heavy on our minds. Which are every bit as much an obstruction as the sin which easily besets us. Which are as much an obstruction as the sin which easily besets us.
47:30 -  God has called us to run a race. God has called us to run a race. And finish the course.
47:36 -  I had to pray today that we are called to be soldiers. I had to pray today that we are called to be soldiers. That there is a war on.

47:49 -  That there are people under orders. That there is a final battle going on. That there is a final battle going on.
47:56 -  How many of us have that understanding? How many of us have that understanding? How many of us have that understanding?
48:03 -  So who is God addressing here? So who is God addressing here? So who is God addressing here?
48:08 -  Is this for the few? Is this for the few? Or that which really in fact constitutes the church?
48:16 -  Or that which really constitutes the church? Consider him who endured such hostility by sinners against himself that you might not grow weary and lose heart.
48:29 -  Verse 3 Verse 3 Consider him who endured such hostility by sinners against himself
48:36 -  that you might not grow weary and lose heart. We need to consider him who is the high priest and the apostle of our confession. We need to consider him who is the high priest and the apostle of our confession.
48:47 -  We who have a heavenly calling. We who have a heavenly calling. Call to be made perfect.
48:54 -  Call to be made perfect. Through suffering. And to finish a course.

49:06 -  That compels and requires us to come into a deeper quality of life and integration with each other. That compels and requires us to come into a deeper quality of life and integration with each other. A humiliating dependency upon each other.
49:18 -  A humiliating dependency upon each other. That intrinsic to church. Intrinsic life.
49:26 -  No, built in, basic. Something happens when you make this apostolic intention. Everything qualitatively shifts and changes.
49:39 -  Even the subject of church itself. It is no longer an option or a luxury. Of where we choose to attend.
49:54 -  We need deeply to be part with a people who have the same intention. Who will exhort us daily while it is yet today. Who will speak the truth in love.
50:13 -  Who confronts us with our sins. We need each other, if we want to be perfect. In this General Assembly, in the Community of the Living God,
50:29 -  God has made every provision. Only one thing is required from us. The intention.
50:39 -  How far do we choose to go? Because it says in Hebrews 10, 14, and I'll try to conclude with this. For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
50:57 -  I have never before considered that. Or spoken that. But it speaks to me tonight in a new and deep way.
51:10 -  He has already perfected us. He has already provided every sanctifying power. By one offering himself.
51:27 -  Shame on us if we live beneath the value of that sacrifice. It is more than just being saved from our sins. It is the total enablement of God.
51:50 -  For our full sanctification. And for our apostolic walk. That we might be made perfect.
52:00 -  And finish the course that has been set before us. What a great offering. What a great sacrifice.
52:17 -  What a suffering provided it. What a gratitude it should stir in our hearts. For so great an offering.
52:31 -  God has begun something by it. That he intends should be finished. He's going to have a holy city.
52:43 -  A new Jerusalem. A Zion of God. A holy city.
52:50 -  A perfected people. In apostolic power. Apostolic authority.
52:57 -  Apostolic character. Apostolic purity. We can warn men knowing the terror of God.
53:05 -  Knowing the terror of God. And that the day of the Lord is at hand. We can command men everywhere to repent.
53:21 -  This is the faith to which God calls us. Do we choose to identify with it? To be part with this holy remnant.
53:42 -  In an unbroken continuum of the faith. With those of whom the world was not worthy. Who are not yet perfect without us.
53:56 -  This is the course that's set before us. It's tremendously demanding. I don't even know how we will finish the fragment that Gary and I have now.
54:08 -  A three month fragment. I'm exhausted just contemplating it. Switzerland and Israel and Egypt and Africa and Zimbabwe and Italy and Sicily and Switzerland again.
54:29 -  Switzerland, Israel, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Italy, Switzerland again. I don't think it's going to end. Until the day of the Lord's appearing.
54:45 -  What is apostolic is ultimate. It's the ultimate requirement of God. For which he has already made one offering.
55:01 -  To those who will run the race. And finish the course. He's the Alpha and the Omega.
55:10 -  He will conclude what he has begun. And conclude it in glory. There's only one thing that we can provide.
55:21 -  Only the intention to be part in this. This is where we should have begun, not ended. What is our intention?
55:35 -  How far are we willing to go? Do we have this divine intention? Choose to see ourselves as part with them?
55:48 -  Willing for the identification as stranger exile pilgrim. We cannot rise above our intention. We cannot live above our intention.
56:07 -  And if we have not this intention, we will have something less. We will cheat this nation. Of the witness that God desire should come to it.
56:22 -  That is apostolic. The thing in itself. The very power of God.
56:32 -  Through selfless men and women. Of whom the world is not worthy. So we have prayed today.
56:45 -  Lord just do not speak. But require. Transact.
56:54 -  Let your word become an event. Let something be inscribed in heaven. Of a people who are willing.
57:08 -  To go out. When called. Not knowing.
57:17 -  Let us bow before God. And give him an answer. A real answer.
57:24 -  An earnest answer. An apostolicly sincere answer. That is an end to play acting and performing.
57:33 -  And getting by. And giving an appearance of something. It is an ultimate intention.
57:44 -  To go all the way. On the basis of that offering. That has already sanctified us.
57:53 -  For those who seek that city. God has prepared for them a place. And you can enter it tonight.
58:04 -  Merely by confessing. Those who say such things. That they are pilgrims and strangers and sojourners.
58:17 -  Is the point of entry. They make it clear they are seeking a country of their own. They desire a better country.
58:31 -  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. He has prepared a place for them. Thank you precious God.
58:45 -  May we have an apostolic ear to hear. What the Spirit is saying to the Church. That we have been called tonight.
58:59 -  As effectively as the call that came to Abraham at the ear of the Chaldeans. It is a call of radical separation. Of a going out.
59:16 -  A not knowing. It invites being made strange. To becoming an exile.
59:30 -  And a stranger. Not just in the world. But in Christendom.
59:39 -  It is ultimate. In the name of Jesus. The author and the finisher of our faith.
59:50 -  Whose minister I have been for this word. This apostolic call. I invite you to give him answer.
01:00:03 -  They who say such things. Declare. They are looking for another country.
01:00:12 -  Another city. Whose builder and maker is God. We need to bring something to the level of consciousness.
01:00:22 -  The level of choice. The level of confession. They who say such things.
01:00:33 -  God invites you to say it. Even tonight. Once and for all.
01:00:41 -  For Jesus sake. We give you opportunity now. I just want you to know that four and a half centuries ago.
01:00:53 -  In Zolikon, just a stone's throw from here. An apostolic movement was begun with no more than what has happened tonight. An apostolic movement has begun with no more than what happened tonight.
01:01:11 -  Someone said to me who had made a choice like this at another time. I saw them the next day. They said nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
01:01:32 -  I'm just seeing differently. Everything has changed. Everything has changed.
01:01:41 -  But nothing has changed. You have crossed the threshold. You have crossed the threshold.
01:01:49 -  A line of... Through the threshold. For those of you who could not bring yourself to do it.
01:01:58 -  And those who have not managed to do it. The spirit will strive with you through the night hours. The spirit will fight with you through the night.
01:02:06 -  I would encourage you not to linger long. If you'll not do it for your own sake. Do it for their sake.
01:02:20 -  Whose witnesses are invisibly around us tonight. And if you'll not do it for their sake. Do it for his sake.
01:02:31 -  Who made an offering once and for all. That we might be sanctified. And that his creation will be redeemed.
01:02:44 -  Through the true church of God. Now it says let us go outside to him. Outside the camp.
01:03:02 -  Bearing his reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city. Where we are sitting seeking a city to come.
01:03:12 -  I believe that Jesus is still outside the camp. He's not where the popular Christianity is. That does not require much of its members.
01:03:26 -  But a succession of services. He's outside. He's outside.
01:03:35 -  In the place of reproach. Waiting for as many as will go out to him. Nothing has changed.
01:03:48 -  So Lord we thank you. What a call you gave us tonight. What a privileged walk.
01:03:57 -  So beyond any ability of our own to fulfill. But you have prepared a place. For those who seek that country.
01:04:13 -  You're not ashamed to be called their God. And I pray your blessing on every child of God in this room. Who has said yes to you tonight.
01:04:26 -  With no more than what we said yes four and a half centuries ago. Grant them every grace. To bear your reproach.
01:04:42 -  Outside the camp. Who will no longer be one of the boys. That even without their saying anything to anyone.
01:04:54 -  Something has happened. Something is exuded through them. That will make their former friends to recoil.
01:05:06 -  And make them to feel strange. Because they have joined those who are exuded. Pilgrims on this earth.
01:05:17 -  Who are not satisfied with anything other. Than the heavenly city of God. Seal your work tonight.
01:05:27 -  And let it be full of consequence. In time and eternity. Because you have the power to change.
01:05:38 -  In time and eternity. Because you have transacted with men. By the word which you sent.
01:05:50 -  For Jesus sake. In my holy name we pray.
