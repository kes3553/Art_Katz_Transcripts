Covenant Consciousness

00:00 -  I'm starting this morning by quoting from Karl Barth, B-A-R-T-H, a great Swiss German theologian, died about 1986, whose 13 or 14 volumes of church dogmatics is the summary of his lifetime thought and a great figure and this is one of those volumes and he speaks
00:32 -  of covenant out from creation he goes back to the point of earliest beginning that creation and covenant are inextricably linked that if God had no other reason to create but to establish a format and a framework for the establishing of covenant that would be sufficient
00:54 -  ground because the heart of covenant is I will be your God and you will be my people so that there needs to be of necessity of people and there needs to be a necessity for God who can honor that promise and if the declaration of this covenant and its fulfillment is the revelation
01:15 -  of God himself as he in fact is if you don't see God in covenant you don't see God so I'll quote and we'll see where it leads us speaks of creation as an incomparable act we mustn't presume for the created order as if this matter of fact and has necessarily to come it's God's divine initiative
01:44 -  he had no need for it it only opened him to a whole assortment of problems and aggravations for which he could have been spared because he knew that with the advent of creation and of man there would be fallenness there would be sin and transgression that his son himself would have to
02:03 -  be the expiation of that sin and yet he did not hesitate so we need to respect the act of creation which is under fire now in all of the fervor about the intelligent design and evolution the world the modern world wants to deny God as creator but we need to plead to this foundational
02:28 -  concept because everything issues from it it's an act of God out of his own love and out of his own initiative and makes possible covenant and all of the reality that follows though he is all wholly so sufficient and absolutely glorious and blessed in his inner life he did not have such will
02:53 -  to be alone covenant his relationship covenant is not a contract I'll do this for you and then you got to do this for me it's the establishing of a relationship and out of the appreciation of the relationship and the love that engenders you keep the covenant but your keeping of it is not its
03:14 -  condition you're not being rewarded for your keeping so it's establishing a relationship between God and his people in which he reveals himself as the faithful God of promise I will this is the freedom of his love and act of the overflowing of his inward glory it says of the
03:38 -  world that it perceived through an act of God the reality existence of form which it did not have it could not therefore give itself because it did not exist at all this is our creation out of an accident some collision in the heavens and some haphazard physiological thing with spectra this
04:01 -  is God's act it's the absolute gift of God it is his good pleasure free omnipotence of the divine love the reality elected and positive positive by this divine good pleasure established and determined and limited by this omnipotence of his love God is love and that love required creation that he
04:28 -  would not be alone that there would be relationship and fellowship with his creatures and that that would be in a bond of covenant by which he takes the initiative Israel is only on the receiving side the terms are stated by God he initiates covenant as he has initiated creation we have
04:50 -  only to accept it or to reject it and we know that the rejection in the history of Israel has been costly and is costly to this day it's a slight against his love so in the chapter on creation and covenant he wants to make possible the history of God's covenant with man which has its beginning
05:18 -  its center and its culmination Jesus Christ the history of this covenant is as much the goal of creation as creation itself is the beginning of history so it's not an exaggeration to say God established creation in order to establish covenant if he went that far how significant
05:39 -  the phenomenon is covenant how much ordered to be esteemed if it required the whole bringing into being that which which was not and opening to God all of the the problems and weight of things that he need not have suffered if he continued to choose to be alone but the creation as the
06:03 -  basis for covenant is the act of his love it's a first work it's the covenant of grace before partnership in which he has predestined and called man men have to be created to be the object of covenant and therefore to miss that identification and to live in independence of
06:32 -  that covenant and the God who calls men to it is to live a fractured life to be out of sorts to be out of joint this is the normative intention of God created man that he should be in covenant relationship with him with a great promise I will be your God you will be my people
06:54 -  and at the end of the age in Jeremiah 30 31 this is exactly the statement that is reiterated in the new covenant that is everlasting creation sets the stage for the story of the covenant of grace has everything to do with the triune Godhead and the agreement of Father Son and
07:16 -  Holy Spirit to God's enterprise with man in the world so there's a collaboration in heaven so to speak within the Godhead itself about the fact of creation and its object namely covenant with man that the Sun himself is one day have to come as the mediator of that covenant and the
07:41 -  bearer of the curse of the covenant but knowing that God did not withhold nor did the Sun nor the Holy Spirit so there's an agreement in the Godhead itself from the beginning for creation and its purpose we need we need to get back you can't go back further than creation but we need to go back
08:03 -  to it in a sense of appreciation and esteem or else it's dismissed as if it's a fact of life that has come in and of itself no it's a chosen act of God with the intention of blessing man and the ultimate blessing that I will be your God and you will be my people is that we will
08:25 -  be in union together and you will even share in my divinity and in my spirit and in my life and that will be the ultimate expression of the covenant blessedness for which you are intended because Israel is the first nation selected the first creation of God and therefore the first
08:50 -  work of his word was light and its separation from darkness only in its separation from light is darkness also created and therefore the creature of God the subject is natural light and natural darkness natural darkness as that which declares the reality which was rejected
09:08 -  by God and has therefore vanished and naturalized light as that which proclaims the will of God opposed to it it is natural light as such which is the irresistible irrevocable declaration of life so he goes back to creation and in the beginning God said let there be light and light
09:29 -  came before the establishment of the luminaries that's the fourth act of God is the creation of the moon and the stars which are just vehicles for the continuation of the expression of light but light is God and that was invoked from the beginning the first act of God let there be light
09:50 -  and light challenges the darkness and it's in that light that we're called to live and walk and have our being and even that the creation of light is an act of grace is a covenantal blessing for man that we should not wallow in darkness and have the light of life the light that came
10:17 -  upon Paul on the road to Damascus was brighter than the noonday sun it was the original light that came with the first act of creation and in that light Paul caught glimpse of the Lord whom he had formerly persecuted and experienced a total revision of his understanding that made
10:40 -  everything of the past to be as death and dust it blinded him and I'm fond of saying that anyone who has received so superb an entree into the faith by which he became the chief apostle and to whom was given the great revelation of the mysteries of God and the mystery of Israel and
11:05 -  the church that we need to dwell on that revelation and that man as the source for the church of the profoundest kind for the last days because he began in a light greater than the light of the noonday sun it did not come by his speculation by the operation of his own brilliant mind it
11:26 -  came by a flash of light from heaven in which he saw such things as has affected everything for his apostolic and eternal future so what issues from him from that light should be for us the most commendable source of guidance and for the last days so Paul is suffering the kind of neglect
11:50 -  as if he's some kind of strange creature and has his own thoughts and having no more credibility than others no he's foremost because to no other apostle came such revelation such apprehension on the road to Damascus as what he experienced it's a light that we could ask for ourselves
12:14 -  although we may at first have to suffer a blindness and the languish for three days neither eating nor drinking as his life was reviewed before him and he forsook all the things to which he had previously submitted as the leading student of the rabbi gamalio talk about
12:36 -  conversion the man was controverted he was completely turned inside out and his whole understanding he saw in the face of Jesus the light of the glory of God one glimpse of that face and that light changes everything we can't do more than to ask some measure of a revelation of
13:01 -  that kind well i think we have to look at the classicus locus which means the classic text on the subject of covenant is the abrahamic covenant every covenant from the know it right through to the new covenant is in some way an adumbration or development of what was
13:24 -  initially given abraham that's the centerpiece and in it are all the quintessential constitutive factors of covenant so in genesis 15 you need to dwell on that giving let me see what it will teach us
13:46 -  because there also is an issue of darkness and of light i'm reading from the amplified after these things the word of the lord came to abraham in a vision saying fear not abraham i'm your shield your abundant compensation and your reward shall be exceedingly great and abraham said
14:07 -  lord God what can you give me since i'm going on for this world childless and he shall be the owner and heir of my house is the steward eliezer of genesis and abraham continued look you have given me no child and a servant born in my house is my heir and behold the word of the lord came to him
14:26 -  saying this man shall not be your heir but he who shall come from your own body shall be your heir so everything begins with God speaking God taking the initiative God the creator and so the lord said the word of the lord came to abraham abraham in a vision fear not and then again in the fourth
14:53 -  the word of the lord came to him saying this man shall not be your heir and he brought him outside the tent into the starlight and said look now toward the heavens and count the stars if you are able to number them then he said to him so shall your descendants be abraham believed and trusted
15:09 -  and relied on remained steadfast to the lord and he counted it to him as righteousness right standing with God and he said to him i'm the lord who brought you out of all the coldies to give you this land as an inheritance but abraham said lord God by what shall i know that i shall inherit it
15:28 -  and he said to him bring to me a heifer three years old a she goat three years old a ram three years old a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he brought him all these and cut them down the middle into halves and laid each half opposite the other but the birds he did not divide when the birds of
15:47 -  praise swooped down upon the carcasses abraham drove them away when the sun was setting a deep sleep overcame abraham in a horror a terror a shattering fear of great darkness assailed and oppressed him and God said to abraham know positively that your descendants will be strange as
16:06 -  dwelling as temporary residents in a land that is not theirs and will be slaves there and they will be afflicted and oppressed for 400 years but i will bring judgment on that nation whom they will serve and after which they shall come out with great possessions so this text is interspersed
16:24 -  with the act of establishing covenant through pieces cut in half and then references to Israel's future history it's a it's like a weave in a tapestry that we need to graciously gently move through the fact that the sun went down and that abraham was greatly afraid and the terror came over him
16:51 -  what you suppose that designates why why would the establishment of the classic covenant which will be the pattern the template of all covenants including the concluding everlasting covenant invoke immediately a terror of fear of darkness birds falling on
17:12 -  of prey falling on the carcass there's a it's a this is a remarkable drama this almost needs a Wagnerian musical backdrop to get the full drama of this this is not some light transaction this is if the heavens themselves are pulsating and trembling because something is being struck
17:32 -  with the father of faith that will affect all subsequent generations and the interesting thing is that abraham himself does not pass through the pieces in a covenant of the classic kind where the word drip the name riff means a cutting
17:51 -  as a word for covenant the two partners who are in agreement pass through the cut pieces indicating that if either party fails they're making a bond unto death and they invoke upon themselves the death that is symbolized or expressed by these cut animals and yet God
18:11 -  does not require abraham to move through these pieces in fact as we learn he sleeps through the occasion and God himself alone walks through the pieces and that's already predictive of the everlasting covenant that i will make with you in those days and put my law in your hearts and
18:31 -  every man will know me from the least to the greatest as if this is all my baby your your failure at covenant keeping is notorious but i'll establish a covenant that will be everlasting because i will give it will also keep it and i'm symbolizing and signifying that by walking through
18:50 -  these pieces now but how can God himself then be a candidate to suffer the death of a failed covenant the curse of a failed covenant what he's doing is implicating his son who will come as the mediator of the covenant to bear its curse and to fulfill the vengeance of the covenant by
19:13 -  his own death and the shedding of his own blood that's why Jesus said at the Passover table at the last supper this is my blood given in the new covenant for you so dwell on this text the details of it
19:33 -  so out of tune with our age so in verse 17 when the sun had gone down and a thick darkness had come on low a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between those pieces and on the same day the
19:50 -  lord made a covenant promise a pledge with abram saying to your descendants i have given this land from the river of egypt to the great river of ephrates the land of the kenites the kenizites the kadmonites the hittites parizites the rifayim the amorites the kenizites
20:08 -  gibberish and jubilates so we need to note that the very first establishment of the covenant is not some area airy and ethereal spiritual blessing although it is that but a concrete specific giving of land the land is a covenant provision of God for abraham and for his
20:30 -  descendants but the heck of it is they cannot possess that land except as being in covenant with God if you're out of covenant your candidates for expulsion that's the expulsion that we anticipate and must necessarily come because in 1948 with the establishment of the state of Israel
20:53 -  through secular and socialist men there was not a fig of understanding about the land as a covenant provision but they just assumed that out of the necessity of the holocaust and the need for homeland the political factors then operative that they could go in and begin to establish that only God
21:13 -  could give and what could only be kept in covenant bond but we mustn't assume that because God works in history to enable a return of a sort that that is the fulfillment of his covenant purposes rather it's to show Israel and its failure that it cannot succeed independent of covenant
21:37 -  relationship because in covenant relationship is the grace given to be to the stranger what we who is in the land and the treatment of the palestinian is a clear indication that secular Israel was incapable of any relationship of that kind in fact their
21:56 -  treatment was so harsh and often so unjust that it exacerbated that people to a frenzy that they think that their children's that their children being of living bonds is a just a sacrifice there's a vehemence and a bitterness among the palestinians for a history of slight
22:17 -  being uprooted being mistreated having their lands taken and misappropriated and various other intimidating acts by which Israel sought to maintain a control but could not be to the stranger in their midst what only a covenant grace would enable it's one thing to be to your own
22:40 -  but to be to the stranger gracious and kind requires a grace from God and that grace is the expression of God given a covenant relationship with him he has seen to it that you cannot succeed independent of that covenant and so there's a short duration and maybe the
23:01 -  intention of God is to indicate to Israel because what are we jews but supreme humanists that you cannot succeed independent of me you took a brave stab at it you transformed the malarial swamp land you established a high-tech civilization but in the end you precipitated your
23:21 -  own destruction and now you'll be cast out of the land and in the and in your reject and in your being cast out you may consider and repent and find that your God and turn to him and he'll restore you to covenant and to the land as a covenant keeper so this is a drama of such
23:44 -  proportions of course we desire a quick and easy solution the state is established it's not doing too well but it will improve but the issue of improvement is exactly the issue of humanism improvement implies that by human thought and ability prowess man can succeed in gradually
24:10 -  altering his circumstance but what Israel has got to see is that the best of our intentions will come back into our teeth and that we have we're reaching a humanly insoluble condition condition that without God we cannot remain in the land so he's this is a circuitous long route
24:35 -  of a momentary historic return getting established in a way in which you think of the pity that those great cities have to be tumbled and the great towers of tel aviv have to come down and the great numbers of ethiopian and russian immigrants will be among the casualties of the
24:57 -  devastation of the last days but so is the great cost that when Jesus comes two-thirds of Israel have already perished and the one-third must necessarily pass through the fire and be to him a restored remnant so this this touches last night's conversation how far will God go
25:16 -  so and what what is at stake here is God's provision of Israel for the nations that you're called to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world you're not called to be a success in yourself and they say look my no hands you're called to minister to the nations
25:38 -  but only out of a brokenness of a people who learn their own sin and and come to a place of contrition and are able to come to their former enemies and bring the knowledge of the mercy of God which they themselves have received after they have experienced his judgments so it's a
25:57 -  costly training for a priestly nation but there's no shortcut and there's no shortcut for us and we we all we have a comparable calling and a comparable requirement to know the lord through dealings that we can minister the
26:19 -  reality of God not just as a correct doctrine but a reality tempered in our own life and experience because that's what priesthood is the world is dying the world is in a substandard condition for the want of Israel's presence among the nations as a priestly nation that's right you
26:38 -  need to know that the great profanation that is sweeping the world the ugliness of culture the universality of its low taste is all a statement of the absence of a people call to teach the nations the difference between the sacred and the profane but the heck of it is that there's
26:57 -  hardly a more profane people on the earth today than Israelis themselves they are tattooed pockmarked uh engraved earrings stomach ring tongue ring nose ring key care they're freaking out their youth their generation everything that God says that you
27:16 -  should not do this should not be tattooed they do they're into the worst aspects of culture and even in america the leaders of the rap music industry are jews the entertainment industry all of the kinds of things that are degrading somehow have their emanation from us in our
27:34 -  genius and our ability to find profit in it so we're functioning exactly in an opposite way to the divine intention and the world is paying the price i even have a secret theory about the root of anti-semitism that is an unconscious resentment on the part of the world of Israel's
27:53 -  failure to be to the nations what we want that somehow the world senses something wanting in that failure and it issues in a resentment against that people and that will never be met again until Israel fulfills its destiny but to go from its present condition to that of a true
28:15 -  priesthood will be through the road to calvary and isaiah 53 is not only the description of the lord's suffering it's a description of the suffering of the nation that will be marred more than any man and that they will have no beauty that any should desire them when they are expelled out from Israel
28:35 -  and elsewhere in the nations and are hated and pursued they're going to experience and measure what came upon the lord himself and in that suffering there'll be a recognition of glimmer oh for our transgressions he was fricking oh he went to the lamb as a slaughter silently we're
28:56 -  complaining and bellowing so what Israel has rejected because isaiah 53 is not even included in the shabbat half torah readings the shabbat prophetic readings it's eliminated of course because it is so christological that when i read it to my mother the first time she said where in
29:20 -  the new testament are you reading she couldn't believe i was reading out of a classic old testament text and so we have lost that text and lost its great meaning and as i said what we have not received by the word we must receive in our experience so there's a road to calvary alone
29:40 -  for the nation and in that suffering as they pass through and have no beauty that any should desire them will will the church itself be tested lord when did we see you naked thirsty hungry will be the the question that will be before us most of the world will turn its back on
29:59 -  this suffering people and even gloat at their condition and say they deserve it they precipitated this they were unruly they didn't care about world opinion it's look what it has cost them tough on them but there'll be a remnant people in the earth that will suffer them take them in
30:19 -  wipe their blood heal their wounds and we saying that this morning this brutal lord is now upon me to hear the broken hearted there's no way to begin to assess the depth of that broken heartedness because when it comes it will come suddenly and the jews are living in a kind of
30:38 -  denial a dream world that even if you're in tel aviv and gaza is steaming and and rockets are going off you are sufficiently insulated that you can have your coffee on the veranda of a coffee house as if you're living in the best of all possible worlds but that world is going to come
30:58 -  down and come down suddenly and so the psychological shock of being uprooted and cast out pursued and stripped will be the condition in which they will come to us and in which they need to be confident by the holy spirit but with what grace shall we meet them if we don't meet them by the grace
31:22 -  given us in covenant because they will be despicable they will be unclean they will be stinking they will not have had access to showers that their clothes are running on their back their sores are malifying and fly infested they're in pathetic condition they have no beauty that
31:40 -  any should desire them how should we desire them except the grace of God by our covenant relationship with him and enables us to be to them what he himself is so the issue of covenant is the critical factor in the consummation of the age for the church toward Israel and that Israel itself
32:02 -  might be saved through it and brought into that everlasting covenant so on the same day in verse 18 the lord made a covenant a promise a pledge it began by speaking it ends by speaking the God who creates is the God who speaks his speaking is an event
32:25 -  and it's on that event of his word and promise that we ought to cast ourselves abraham cast himself on that although his body was as good as dead looking upon himself he had no descendants he was near 100 years old as was sarah and God said look at the stars of
32:45 -  the sky so great will your your progeny be and he believed God despite every appearance to the contrary God said he believed so this is our classic father of the faith and the one with whom God makes the classic covenant that becomes the pattern of all subsequent covenant
33:13 -  and in 17 we have another visitation of the lord when abraham is 99 years old the lord appeared to him and said i am the almighty God walk and live habitually before me and be perfect blameless wholehearted complete
33:34 -  that's that's an invitation to be a son of a covenant there's no way you're going to be that by human resolve God gives an ultimate like mount of the attitude requirement be thou perfect and walk thou before me only possible by someone with whom a covenant has been made who can draw
33:57 -  on the grace of God to be this with him and i will make my covenant my solemn pledge between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and God said to him as for me behold my covenant is with you and you shall be the father of many nations you didn't
34:18 -  deserve this you didn't earn it there's nothing that you can perform it is something i'm simply conferring and pronouncing it is it's a covenant to be kept but the keeping of it is not the condition for its continuance
34:41 -  the keeping of it as i've said before is rather the spontaneous and free loving response to the goodness of God and inviting us into a relationship with him and for that reason we want to keep it but it's not a legal obligation that if we don't perform
34:58 -  it we're out we have to understand that that would be a contract that's the model for the world's contract these are the conditions of a legal kind but a covenant is something transcendent a covenant is something that has come down from above from God the creator out of
35:16 -  himself of what he isn't himself and some of the biblical commentators even suggest though the texts do not give us any ground to presume it that the father and son and holy spirit are themselves covenantally related the one catch is that in covenant it's a superior
35:36 -  addressing an inferior but in the Godhead there are no inferiors so that that thought kind of suffers loss but we have to assume that God did not just pluck the concept of covenant out of the air it emanated and issued out of what he is in himself and for that reason it needs to be more
36:00 -  affectionately held and observed and and respected and obeyed obedience is a key but it's not the obedience of a legal attitude it's the obedience of love grateful for the benefit of the provision of this relationship with very God if your obedience issues from that
36:24 -  is an acceptable obedience but there are few believers who have that kind of mentality rather they are striving to assert rather than acting out of a love of gratitude okay so i quite agree that the smoking pot of the blazing torch is symbolic of the crucifixion of
36:44 -  Jesus a statement well before the event but summing up the horror the pain the anguish the utterance of that sacrifice which is a sacrifice unto death from fire as it were uh from the very beginning of the uh of the making of this everlasting covenant
37:06 -  that is prefigured and the lord himself will in time perform it the lord speaks about the 400 years of slavery that is yet future for the nation but you can say also that the oven and the torch not only presages the sacrifice of Jesus but the holocaust of the jew throughout its history
37:27 -  there'll be a suffering there'll be a devastation more than once and yet a future time before the everything is consummated so this is a remarkable symbolic ceremony the act of God that's recorded for us here i think the number has a significance but it's equally on historic time because it gives
37:54 -  the time for the iniquity of the amerites to be made full so that when Israel is delivered out from egypt they begin the conquest of the canaanite land and bring judgment that is now on time for these pagan peoples so that many purposes being served 400 i'm sure is
38:15 -  significant four often designates the four corners of the earth 100 of them multiplied so let's look at this companion piece in genesis 17 in which God requires this in making my covenant between me and you
38:36 -  you verse six is the verse five the promise of the father of multitudes many nations which is reiterating the initial call of agraham and genesis 12 i'll make you exceedingly fruitful
38:56 -  i will make nations of you and king shall come from you and i will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout your generations for an everlasting solemn pledge to be a God to you and to your prosperity after you i have underlined and i
39:12 -  recommended to you in verses six and seven the words i will i will i will you won't i will this has nothing to do with your virtue your character your ability i will i will establish this covenant and again in first aid another i will gift you into your posterity after you
39:38 -  the land in which you are a stranger and the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their God God said to abraham as for you you shall keep therefore my covenant you and your descendants after you throughout your generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between
39:58 -  me and you and your posterity after you every male among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token or sign of the covenant the promise of pledge between me and you something is being registered by that act by which men acknowledges
40:19 -  his impotence and that the flesh that is being cut off as a statement that he will not trust in flesh to succeed in any covenant promise or blessing but that the God of i will will perform what he has spoken and that always to look upon yourself and see the sign of that
40:40 -  covenant in your circumcision is to be reminded that you should have no confidence in the flesh and in philippians Paul speaks of anything he says for we are the circumcision who rejoiced in christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh so this is given of God made very clear
41:04 -  made explicit written into our flesh that we're not to trust in flesh in any fulfillment of God's intention he will i will make my covenant between me and you i will bless you all of you God if you you shall be my sons and my daughters verse 13 he that is born in your house
41:24 -  he that is bought with your money must be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for everlasting covenant and the male who is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant so what think ye of this strange requirement
41:48 -  which has been so reduced in jewish understanding that circumcision today is looked upon a hygienic provision the whole spiritual significance is entirely lost to those who submit to it yeah and that's where God convinced us that we're uncircumcised in our hearts
42:12 -  and need to be restored to this sacred act which we acknowledge God has God and ourselves capable of nothing now if this is true for Israel to what degree is it true for us
42:33 -  are we also the circumcised when Paul says we are the circumcision is he speaking about jewish believers only he's speaking about the church we are the circumcision how can they say that because we have been called into this covenant and that the circumcision that we bear is not
42:53 -  one made with hands but the Jesus that was cut out from the land of the living that when we're baptized into him we're circumcised with him we're cut off and out from the land of the living and we're brought into this realm through baptism having no confidence in the flesh well it's hard
43:14 -  to think of any other place in the human anatomy where a cutting could take place of this symbolic kind without doing a permanent injury or threatening life and yet be a visible sign that you carry in your lifetime as a nation as a people in fact it might well not be an
43:33 -  exaggeration say foreskin was given to be cut off not to be retained and to retain it as an act of presumption and male prowess and stud you know that kind of the kind of thing that australians most but a circumcised male is a humbled male and we need so to be in jewish religion
44:04 -  it's a rabbi called a mohel m-o-h-e-l but most circumcisions take place in the hospital by the birthing doctor ariel was circumcised in lokal and david was never circumcised he was born in denmark and there there was a stigma
44:26 -  against circumcision england went blue in the face when i when i urged david's circumcision because to her it was inflicting him with a sign that would make him conspicuously a venereal a candidate or bearer of venereal disease she understood nothing in her gentile mind about
44:49 -  the practice that for us jews are so instinctive that we don't think twice about it but i deferred to her she went purple and to this day david is not circumcised and i wondered to what degree was suffering the problems with them that we are because of that failure but here abraham himself
45:07 -  does it he circumcises all the males of his household and we know that when Israel subsequently under joshua crossed the jordan they came to the hill of forstons and they could not eat this the Passover until they were all circumcised so it may well be that they circumcised one another
45:29 -  it doesn't say how or who or by what means the same thing is true of water baptism it doesn't matter who officiates it's valid when you go under that water you wouldn't want any clumsy butcher you want a sensitive man
45:44 -  and if we have made water baptism a trite and superficial religious requirement and fallen short of its deepest appropriation as the sign of the covenant as a circumcision made with our hands to what degree are we in the covenant to what degree are we cut off from the
46:10 -  house of Israel and it may well be that this is so widespread the superficiality of water baptism today the infant sprinkling or even adult immersion does not necessarily guarantee that appropriation unless we go into it with this understanding of this desire
46:31 -  that we cut off from the flesh and so maybe the substandard condition of the church is large enough to be found in the neglect of water baptism and the sign of the covenant which it confers why because we've lost the whole sense of covenant and the meaning of these
46:51 -  practices and so we get dunked or we perform a religious obligation or we come up out of that water unchanged and still live according to the flesh so that doesn't mean that you need to be re-immersed but it does mean that you need to by faith appropriate what God says as
47:13 -  barry just read that and the other places in scripture took place in your baptism lord i did not realize it then in fact i probably at that time would not even have intended it but now i want the full measure of what that baptism represented i don't have to repeat the act
47:32 -  i'm asking by faith that you would confer that reality that i would be among the circumcised having no confidence in the flesh but rejoicing in christ Jesus when you're joined with God and covenant you are in the position to receive every race
47:52 -  i will be with you it's more than just a little flippant remark it means i will impart i will extend i will give of those qualities of the divine kind without which you cannot be my people so if we're languishing and struggling through circumstances it may well be because we're
48:13 -  seeking to find solution humanly or in the flesh and are not in the deep place of abiding in covenant through circumcision and need to be freshly cut again because there's something about the foreskin i don't know that i can prove this but i suspect that it will grow over again if if
48:33 -  it's allowed to and it's even favored and cultivated you might find that fleshly protuberance showing itself so there needs to be a kind of frequency of cutting a frequency of renewal of covenant a submitting to the cross and the death of baptism in any excess evidence of the flesh
48:57 -  that once again to express itself and have thought so we need to keep in that circumcised place we are the circumcision is a remarkable statement and it needs to come into our consciousness without embarrassment that the new creation implies that circumcision made without hands
49:19 -  so he says neither circumcision or uncircumcision counts for anything because he's countering the tendency among gentile believers to be judiized that somehow their faith is inadequate unless they take on aspects of the law which he sees that if
49:33 -  you so much as condescend to one aspect of the law you forfeit all grace so we only have to understand the context in which father speaking in galatians he's not negating this baptism that we're referring to that's implicit in that new creation but he is negating the jewish practice
49:53 -  that gentiles were being encouraged to adopt by judiizes as somehow completing their faith and recognizing that any condescension to law negates all grace that's true for us as it was for them so circumcision is a complete cutting away there's no prospect of picking up from the
50:13 -  flesh to supplement and to help us in tight situations and what shall i say you need to be a preacher you need to be in a precarious place where you're tempted to fill in out of yourself or some proven past text when you're faced with the terror of a new word and an untested word
50:37 -  and a seemingly hostile audience there's every the flesh is beckoned to depend upon itself and rely upon its own ability rather than cast itself upon God so we preachers or others who are in precarious place of faith are faced we face continually the issue of flesh versus spirit
51:00 -  i'm facing it now don't think that we had all this laid out i've got a brighter books i don't know where to go to the next line or the next statement trusting the lord for the unfolding and happy in hearing what i am because how dare we speak of circumcision and having no confidence in the flesh
51:20 -  when we speak of it out of the flesh that would be a patent contradiction in terms so of necessity the subject itself must be presented in its own context and that's why the lord has got me in my feverish condition this morning i'm substandard and uh trusting that
51:39 -  there'll be no confidence in the flesh a lot you can't take up the subject out of any natural ability that you have i'm going to mediate this truth i'll bring it forth and you you rest i've gone between the pieces and i'll be your provision
52:00 -  and not only here and now but in every occasion i will be your God we need to have a heightened respect for the calatians the corinthians all the gentiles that submitted to this water baptism were not just getting wet they were being cut off and out from the land of
52:18 -  the living they were radically being separated from the flesh from paganism from culture from ancestry and all of the remarkable idolatries that prevailed in that time the act of water baptism was the deepest consecration for those gentile believers it needs to be made that again
52:37 -  what did Paul call those who wanted to cut the flesh the judaizes is a word that he used that they were like mutilators so then what is the testimony to Israel in a gentile believer desisting from a physical circumcision and receiving the one made without hands
52:57 -  but that having been a fruitless branch and cut off is now grafted in by this water baptism and the life of the sap of the root flows through this branch in a new way bearing fruit that moves Israel to jealousy that Israel now perceives in gentiles the fruit that should have
53:19 -  issued from its own life but being cut off from covenant they themselves are fruitless but to see the distinctive fruit of covenant blessedness coming from gentiles who have not been physically circumcised is a remarkable testimony to the depth and significance of that which is not made
53:37 -  with hands and we're still waiting the fulfillment of that great mystery in the and the expression of that fruit
