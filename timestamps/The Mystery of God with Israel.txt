The Mystery of God with Israel

00:00 -  I have been asked to share a birthday that I have for Israel in this moment in which we live. And I'm speaking these things not because I'm a Jew, or this is a personally precious thing to me because I'm Jewish,
00:32 -  but because it is so critical to the church itself. It's a mystery of which Paul speaks, that is being fulfilled at the end of the age.
00:56 -  And to ignore this would be to limit the church according to God's intention. For God has intended that we be in a collision course with Israel. That we have a reciprocal destiny.
01:26 -  In such a way that Israel can never come to God's intention for it, independent of the church. Independent of the church. But at the same time, the church cannot come into its eternal destiny,
01:56 -  independent of its relationship with Israel. We are locked in. And the devil knows this better than the church.
02:08 -  And has sought to rob this from us, or to distort it. So I want to speak this in the apostolic context. God's view of the church and Israel in the apostolic setting.
02:34 -  And Paul speaks of this in three chapters in the book of Romans 9, 10, and 11. And of course we don't have time for any kind of real treatment of this important theme. But just to give you a first beginning,
03:00 -  and then to remind you that last night I spoke here on this subject, that those tapes are available to you, and that you can hear a fuller presentation by listening to them.
03:19 -  But for now in Romans 11, verse 25, I would not rather that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceit,
03:33 -  that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. And then all of Israel shall be saved.
03:58 -  There is a remarkable thing that is soon to take place, of which God would not have us, the church, to be ignorant. Indeed the church is the key to this fulfillment.
04:19 -  Israel is presently blind, cannot see the issue of Jesus as Messiah. God has used that blindness in order to open the Gospel to the Gentiles,
04:40 -  until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. What does Paul mean here? He means until all of the full number of the church be complete.
05:01 -  See how we've had to wait for you. The church would not have been complete without you. We had to wait for the fullness of the full number
05:15 -  of a people for his name from among all nations. And that is presently happening and coming to completion. And when you go out in your own evangelistic work,
05:32 -  this is the mystery that you have completed. So that even if you're not making direct personal contact with Jews, you are yet affecting their destiny by your obedience to the Gentiles.
05:58 -  Bringing this fullness in. So I'm talking now about the numerical and the quantitative aspect of the fullness. Now comes a more difficult question.
06:12 -  The qualitative aspect. What does Paul mean there? That the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.
06:26 -  I think he means that every Gentile thing should be finished. I think he means that every Gentile thing should be finished. Remember I said to you in the last hour that when Paul came to the Thessalonians,
06:50 -  he didn't come to them as a Jew. Yes, of course, naturally speaking, he was Jewish. But he didn't come to them in that sense.
07:05 -  He came to them in a transcendent sense. Beyond nationality, beyond culture. He was the man of the kingdom.
07:20 -  And he says, you received the word from us. Not as the word of man, but for what it really is. The word of God that performs the work in them that hear it.
07:38 -  Because it turned you from your idols to serve the living God. And now God is wanting you to do the same thing at the end of the age. But only if you come in the transcendent way.
08:03 -  For example, Dick was with me a few months ago at a black church in America. A black Pentecostal church. I felt like I was in an occultic situation.
08:24 -  The place was squirming with snakes. It has become in America a black culture. And they had invited me to speak.
08:40 -  And they didn't know what they were getting. My heart was pounding. Because I knew that the hour had come.
08:53 -  When God was going to blow the whistle on that. That that gentile stuff had to end. That gentile black religious culture had to end.
09:11 -  And the kingdom of God had to come. And we couldn't allow them to remain in that condition. However much we liked their singing.
09:26 -  And so I came up with trembling. And Paul trembled also. And you will tremble too.
09:39 -  But we will still be obedient to them. And I spoke such words to them. Their eyes were like saucers. They couldn't believe what this man was saying.
09:59 -  When I left the church that night a woman stopped me in the hallway. She had been one of those who had given a testimony earlier in the night before I spoke. It was a performance.
10:24 -  It was a lie. I want to say that, the Lord for me, I want to say that... It was a fixed piece of performance.
10:44 -  Which brought her a soulless gratification. And those who heard it. It reinforced the culture.
10:58 -  But it was a lie. And God says that the church is the ground and pillar of truth. And I was not going to affirm them in their lies.
11:18 -  I was going to address the lie. In the power of the Spirit. Some white people who had come that night as guests said to me that when they heard me begin to speak they feared for their lives.
11:35 -  Because how would these black people take a statement like that? How dare that white man speak like that? And be critical of our religion from his white point of view.
11:59 -  From his white point of view. His cultural perspective. But they never reacted that way.
12:12 -  Because I did not come to them from a white man's point of view. I came to them from their kingdom's point of view. I came to them above culture and above race.
12:26 -  And they knew it. The fullness of the gentiles had come in. That same woman who had given the testimony grabbed my hand as I was leaving the church.
12:49 -  She said, I want to thank you brother. Your word has set me free. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
13:03 -  And she heard the word of truth. I'm giving you this as an illustration. Of what I think God is waiting for.
13:17 -  That blindness might come off the eyes of Israel. Because the gentile thing has fully been finished. Not only religion as culture.
13:36 -  But religion as manipulation. Platform control. Where you have God's service that is predestined.
13:52 -  More than what I can say here. And that is gentile. And that does not come out of the Hebrew spirit.
14:05 -  The spirit of God. That has distorted the church. Corrupted it. That has got to be finished.
14:16 -  We've got to come to an end to it. And be the true and the real kingdom people of God. That's why in the same letter of the Thessalonians.
14:29 -  Paul says at the end of that chapter. At the end of this chapter. In verse 2 and 12.
14:40 -  That we shall walk. For a walk that would be worthy of God. Who has called you unto his kingdom and glory.
14:50 -  He who calls you unto his kingdom and glory. First test 2 and 12. So the assembly is the key to the resurrection of Israel.
15:10 -  They are blind and waiting for something in us. For us to come to a certain fullness. And Paul says in the same chapter 11.
15:26 -  In verse 11 of Romans. Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid.
15:39 -  But rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy. Here's the mystery again expressed in another way. They seem to have fallen away from the purposes of God.
16:06 -  They have rejected the prophets and Christ. They have opposed the gospel right into modern times. But they have not fallen in the sense that God is permanently finished with them.
16:28 -  Rather by the spirit Paul says they've stumbled. Momentarily. So that salvation should come to the Gentiles.
16:45 -  But what is the purpose of the salvation coming to the Gentiles? So as to move them to jealousy. This is what I shared with the school last night.
17:10 -  There is a purpose for our salvation beyond ourselves. Which we need fully to take into our consideration. We receive many benefits being saved.
17:38 -  But there is a greater purpose for our salvation beyond ourselves. That serves a purpose in God and for him. Because it will move them to jealousy.
17:57 -  That they might be saved. And Paul says that what should it mean if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world. What shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead.
18:09 -  Verse 15. If their casting away already had the reconciling of the world. What shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead?
18:25 -  Do you like what I'm saying? Amen. Because I am a piece of life from the dead. For 35 years I was a dead man.
18:39 -  I was a Marxist and an atheist. An enemy of God. But there came a time when God saved me.
18:48 -  I shared last night how I was made jealous in one moment. When he had me to meet an ordinary Gentile girl as a hitchhiker. A girl without any qualifications.
19:10 -  Gentile of the Gentiles. But in whose face I saw the light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of the people as well. It's a light I had never seen in any university.
19:29 -  Any ideology, any philosophy. It made me jealous. Where did she get that?
19:43 -  That was the beginning. By which the Lord brought me to himself. It's a picture of his program for the entire nation.
19:57 -  That there might be many art cats brought back to his service. That there might be many art cats brought back to his service. To bring a special dimension of things to his people and to the nations.
20:15 -  Which Paul says it's like life from the dead. But how are they brought back? They are made jealous.
20:27 -  Through those to whom salvation has come because of their fall. It raises this great question. It raises this great question.
20:37 -  What kind of church could conceivably move Jews to jealousy at the end of the age? What kind of church could conceivably move Jews to jealousy at the end of the age? Clearly something more than what we've ever known.
20:52 -  Clearly something more than what we've ever known. Clearly something more than what we've ever known. Something other, something beyond.
21:10 -  Something glorious. Amen. Paul says unto him be glory in the church.
21:26 -  World without end. Throughout all ages. Paul speaks about the church as if it is an eternal phenomenon.
21:49 -  God's eternal masterpiece. And it is. And you are it.
21:59 -  Can you see why he is willing to invest so much in you? Daily instruction. Raising up the best of his men and his women.
22:17 -  They pour their souls out for you. Not just to give you the gospel, but my life also. That you might be formed into such a church.
22:35 -  That God might have the eternal glory. And only such a church can move Jews to jealousy. Now here's the point children.
22:56 -  We will not come to that glory. Because it's not going to be an easy trip. This is no light thing.
23:11 -  The flesh just wants to rest in the pew. Religion as usual. These Sunday services.
23:24 -  Put a few crowns in the collection place. Amen hallelujah. A few choruses.
23:32 -  Biblical message. Go home. And our life is nothing more than the succession of services.
23:44 -  We will never come to the fulfillment of this mystery that way. What then brother? We're going to have to go from house to house daily breaking bread.
24:02 -  The way they did in the beginning. We're going to need to speak the truth and love to each other. We're going to have to exhort one another daily while it is yet today.
24:15 -  Next Sunday it's too late. We're called to something earnest. Something real.
24:28 -  Something totally demanding. It's not comfortable. We want to retreat into our privacy.
24:40 -  Leave things as they are. Drown it out before the TV set. God calls us to something more.
24:56 -  And the motive is for his glory. It's something we would not do even for ourselves. But unto him be glory and the truth.
25:09 -  But unto him and unto him shall the assembly be glorified. Try to understand this. What will it mean for God's glory?
25:23 -  To restore the nation of Israel again to himself. Who have so long turned against him. And rejected his messiah.
25:43 -  And gave their own messianic alternatives. Karl Marx was a Jew. Sigmund Freud was a Jew.
25:59 -  But they've turned from the knowledge of God. They've even opposed him. But God's love is greater.
26:13 -  And Paul says in Romans, he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy. How contrary to the wisdom of the world. The world says they don't deserve it.
26:32 -  But what can we deserve from God? If God gave us what we deserve, where would any of us be? But he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy.
26:51 -  Because he will be who he will be. And he says, now you've received mercy? Now by your mercy, let them receive mercy.
27:07 -  That he might have mercy upon all. What a demonstration to the world. Of what God is in himself.
27:20 -  Full of loving kindness and mercy. Even to restore this nation. Can you imagine what their message to the nations will be?
27:39 -  Can you imagine Jews going to Saudi Arabia and Jordan and to Kuwait and all of the Arab nations? Full of the joy of the Lord. Full of the salvation of God.
27:56 -  Because mercy has come to them. Which they didn't deserve. They're saved out of death.
28:05 -  And now they have a message to the nations. Come up to Jerusalem. The word is going forth out of Jerusalem.
28:18 -  It's salvation for the earth. When the world sees what God has done with this people. And if he has had mercy on them.
28:30 -  Upon whom will he not have mercy. It's life from the dead. And it begins with them.
28:40 -  Through you. We are the key to Israel's restoration. We are the key to Israel's restoration.
28:55 -  And Israel is the key to the nations restoration. What a calling. We have to say with Paul, who is sufficient for these things?
29:14 -  Truly. The Lord is going to have to be all in all for us. He's going to have to move us from faith to faith.
29:31 -  And from glory to glory. And to deal with those gentle things in our life that still remain. Insecurity.
29:44 -  Fear. Self-consciousness. Jealousy.
29:50 -  Envy. Resentment. Bitterness.
29:56 -  He's going to have to change us. Form us in his image. Apostolic people.
30:06 -  Who love one another. With a pure heart fervently. Where we have an unfamed love of the brethren.
30:20 -  So that even the unbelieving Jews when they look at you have to say. Look how they love one another. No man lives for himself alone.
30:34 -  There's not one among them that has need. This is a people of one soul and one mind. Who in the world were enemies against each other.
30:48 -  Men against women. Black against white. Rich against poor.
30:58 -  Made one in God. It'll move them to jealousy. They are waiting on us.
31:10 -  Something from us. And it is God's incentive to us. To bring us to maturity.
31:26 -  No other motivation will be enough. But to fulfill this. That's why God wants to speak this into your spirit this morning.
31:44 -  But you say, I don't know any Jews. And I don't even know if there are any Jews in Erebro. It doesn't matter.
31:56 -  In the mystery of the purposes of God. Your condition. Your situation.
32:08 -  Will affect their destiny. Will affect their destiny. Yes.
32:18 -  We're in this together. Paul calls it a mystery. It's until now.
32:30 -  But of which he would not have you to be ignorant. It's a mystery now to be filled. And it's a mystery now to be filled.
32:42 -  What a great calling. Who is sufficient for this? God must be all in all.
32:58 -  We must walk worthy of the calling to which we've been called. Both of the kingdom and of the glory. And that's the last word that I leave with you.
33:14 -  The glory. The glory. Paul was jealous for the glory.
33:26 -  That's what makes an apostle an apostle. Unto him be glory. Take that into your spirit.
33:38 -  Make that your chief motivation. Because you're going to suffer. Much will be required of us all.
33:54 -  There will be difficult trials. Your flesh will want to run away from it. And go back to something easier.
34:06 -  The world will try to draw you back. And seduce you. Into false comfort.
34:18 -  What God has called you to the way of the cross. But God has called you to the way of the cross. Yes, there will be a suffering.
34:28 -  But it results in a glory. It did for him. And it will for us.
34:38 -  Be jealous for the glory. And it will bring you through. I want to pray for a glorious church.
34:52 -  Made up of living stones. Fitted and formed of God. To move Israel to jealousy.
35:06 -  And fulfill the mystery of the existence of God. Life from the dead. The key to the nations.
35:24 -  Beginning with us. So Lord in Jesus name. Help us to understand.
35:36 -  To take this into our deepest consciousness. Such a calling. And here your call came to us.
35:50 -  None of us deserved anything from you. You saved us out of death. And you took us from where we were.
36:02 -  And day by day. You are so patiently and lovingly building us. Forming us.
36:12 -  As vessels for your glory. A true people. Above nationality and culture.
36:24 -  Beyond that which is gentile. A people of the kingdom and of the glory. We need your blessing.
36:38 -  And grace upon grace. To fulfill this. And fulfill this we will.
36:50 -  For the honor and glory of your name. That we might eternally rejoice together. World without end.
37:04 -  Throughout all ages. From eternity to eternity.
