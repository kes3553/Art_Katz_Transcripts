Walking in the Spirit 2

00:00 -  Hallelujah. Can we have just a little word of prayer before we continue? Can we have a short word of prayer before we continue? Let it be, precious God, your continuation, line upon line, precept upon precept,
00:18 -  the work of your glorious spirit, the complete work of which we've asked, refresh our spirits, let us not sag and grow weary, but give us a holy and a burning desire to go all the way with you,
00:43 -  till every last resistance to your spirit be overcome, and you might sweep all before you in the fire of your revival for Holland and for Jesus' sake. Amen.
01:07 -  Well, this was a remarkable episode that we discussed this morning. The enormous revelation that was granted to Peter, not by the will of man or flesh or blood,
01:25 -  but from the Father who is in heaven. Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, Jesus said. But my Father which is in heaven,
01:38 -  blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah. It's the beginning of true blessedness. It's the authentic revelation of who Jesus is.
01:54 -  And we mentioned how desperately needed such revelation is in this particular hour. When the name of Jesus has been so painfully blasphemed, and one is stunned at his popularity,
02:21 -  and the frequency with which his name is taken in the mouths of men, and also abused and misused, he really needs to be set forth as he truly is.
02:43 -  He needs to be seen as he is, as only the Father can reveal him from heaven. Because it's the beginning of true blessedness,
03:01 -  and the only means by which we can also bless others. And yet, what is the stunning fact that the same man who is so privileged to see this by the revelation of spirit,
03:21 -  it is that the same man who was so blessed to be revealed by the Spirit, that he was just a moment later bewitched by Jesus, and it came that Jesus had told him something in verse 21,
03:52 -  From then on, Jesus Christ began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and learn how to read and write, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.
04:09 -  And Peter took him aside and began to punish him. Let that sink into a hearing. What is man that he should be mindful of us?
04:26 -  Let alone that man should take God and rebuke him. It's an astounding fact.
04:41 -  It's stunning, the audacity of man to rebuke the Son of the Living God. And you would be amazed at the frequency with which this goes on.
04:56 -  And you would be amazed by the frequency, and you would be amazed that this is happening. And you would be amazed by the frequency, and you would be amazed that this is happening.
05:14 -  We suffer from something that we don't understand. We don't like it, it's painful. When will this trial pass?
05:29 -  How come we're suffering this and the others are not? Why? Why me? Have you ever thought that that question is a statement that reveals rebellion?
05:44 -  That so much as to question God, that so much as to question God, to take him and to rebuke him,
05:59 -  it is an unspeakable audacity on the part of man. And you can multiply the instances. Do you remember the sisters of Lazarus, Mary and Martha?
06:14 -  Do you remember the sisters of Lazarus, Mary and Martha? One was considered to be more spiritual than the other. Until crisis came.
06:30 -  And then there was really not much difference between them. Lord, if you had been here, what tone of accusation is in that question?
06:45 -  Lord, if you had been here, our brother would not have died. What a contradiction is in even the question. How can he both be Lord and not be here?
07:00 -  How can he be Lord and not be perfectly aware of all that is taking place? How can he be Lord and not be fully aware of all that is taking place? How dare we charge him with the implication that somehow he was mindless of our condition and of our need?
07:16 -  How can we accuse him that somehow he was not aware of our condition and our need? It is no wonder that we have the shortest verse in all the Bible. It is no wonder that we have the shortest verse in all the Bible.
07:34 -  It says, Jesus wept. If the Lord would open the heavens tonight, and show us by the light of his revelation
07:49 -  the way we have misused and abused God, the way that we have rebuked him and questioned him, the way that we have rebuked him and questioned him,
08:04 -  it would be a shock beyond all speaking. Probably one of the most lamentable lacks in our generation, the absence of something,
08:20 -  is the absence of the fear of God. is the absence of the fear of God. There just doesn't seem to be an appropriate reverence for God.
08:40 -  There seems to be such a casual air that characterizes modern Christianity. A certain matter of factness. If you squint your eyes a little bit,
08:59 -  you would almost think that men are employing God for their purposes. As if he has an obligation to fit himself into their services. As if he has an obligation to fit himself into their services.
09:14 -  And to adjust himself to their convenience. And comply with their church bulletins and programs. There is an enormous abuse of God.
09:29 -  There is an enormous abuse of God. Until your spirit almost cries out for some kind of decent atheism. Until your spirit almost cries out for some kind of decent atheism.
09:44 -  That makes no profession of knowing God. Let alone those that should call upon his name and misuse him for their ends. Let alone those that should call upon his name and misuse him for their ends.
09:59 -  Maybe we need to examine what it is that provoked Peter to speak as he did. Maybe we need to examine what it is that provoked Peter to speak as he did. That a man could go from the spirit to the flesh in a matter of moments.
10:14 -  That a man could go from the spirit to the flesh in a matter of moments. If so great an apostolic figure as Peter was capable of this, what shall we say? If so great an apostolic figure as Peter was capable of this, what shall we say?
10:30 -  A moment after his perfect revelation of who Christ is. A moment after his perfect revelation of who Christ is. He's speaking out of the flesh.
10:46 -  Let this be far from you, Lord. I don't see that that's so fleshy art. It's full of well-meaning sentiment.
11:01 -  It has the will of God in its heart. It's kindly in its intention. And it shows that he had a feeling, a love for the Lord.
11:17 -  If you ask those questions, it's a revelation of how deeply you yourself are in the flesh. Do you think that flesh only takes on the most blatant and conspicuously evil forms?
11:32 -  Do you think that flesh only takes on the most evil forms? Do you think that flesh only has to do with orgies and drugs? And that flesh has nothing to do with decency or morality or ethics?
11:52 -  And that it can be just as offensive to God as the most blatant carnal sin? That which is born of the spirit is spirit. That which is born of the flesh is flesh.
12:08 -  The flesh is an enmity with the spirit. It lusts against the spirit. And the spirit against the flesh.
12:23 -  It's an irreconcilable conflict. There's a war on. Of such totality.
12:38 -  But somehow the proportions of this have been blunted for us. Somehow we have been more condescending to things of the flesh than the Lord himself. Well it's not bad.
12:58 -  It's for the Lord's sake. It's producing some results. And lenient and condescending.
13:13 -  But the Lord was not. It was one of the severest rebukes he had ever given any disciple. And I want to assure you
13:33 -  that God has not changed one width since. He's just as absolute in his opposition to all that is born of the flesh.
13:48 -  Only we are not that severe. If it works, if it produces some results, we let it pass.
14:03 -  We're more concerned with utility. If it produces a result, we're not as fastidious as the Lord himself.
14:18 -  As painstaking. That his ends be accomplished by his means only. That if there's something that is of the spirit which is holy and sinless and pure,
14:33 -  it must come into being by the same means. Hail Mary, thou hast found grace and favor in the sight of God. Hail Mary, thou hast found grace and favor in the sight of God.
14:48 -  Virgin of Israel. Undefiled and chaste. Undefiled and chaste.
15:03 -  But how shall these things be, seeing I know not any man? The Holy Spirit shall hover over you. And that which shall be born of you
15:18 -  shall be holy, sinless and pure. Shall be holy, sinless and pure. And that was the beginning of the end of times.
15:33 -  And so also must it conclude with that which comes down from heaven only. And is transmitted through virgin vessels.
15:49 -  Trying to find a vulgar way not to say it, not to say this, no. Who will not spread themselves to any other influence.
16:04 -  That that which is in the earth from heaven can be again holy, sinless and pure. Jesus said, Get thee behind me, Satan.
16:20 -  For thou art an offence that stink unto me. For you smell of the things that be not of God. But those that be of men.
16:35 -  How many of us have the power to do this? But those that be of men. How many of us have pondered that verse as much as we ought?
16:50 -  I'll tell you that it'll bring some startling things to your attention. One is the utter simplicity of Christ. He sees right through to the heart of things.
17:05 -  He has a kind of a total perception. A simplistic view. Unaffected by sophisticated theologies.
17:20 -  He sees things coming from either one or another place. He sees things coming from either one or another place. He sees things coming from either one or another place.
17:35 -  Above or below. And doesn't recognize any other source. He says that which savors of Satan and not of God
17:50 -  is that which also smells of man. Is that which also smells of man. He made them to stand as being one and the same.
18:05 -  He equated that which comes of Satan as that which comes of man. He equated that which comes of Satan as that which comes of man. How many of us have so absolute a view?
18:20 -  That we would be as quick to rebuke anything that comes from man That we would be as quick to rebuke anything that comes from man as if it had come from Satan himself.
18:35 -  Dear children, how you need to come to this perception. Because I can tell you that the greatest threat in the end times Because I can tell you that the greatest threat in the end times
18:51 -  is not the evil itself, but that which is good. Let it be far from you, Lord. That's a good statement. It's full of good intentions.
19:06 -  Full of good sentiment. But there was only one thing wrong with it. And had Jesus accepted it and acted upon it we would not one of us be in this room now.
19:21 -  That kindly sentiment would have been enough to keep him from his cross to keep him from his suffering
19:36 -  and from his atoning work. It was full of well-meaning attention. Kindly, but it came from below. The severe choice that we will have to make at the end of the age
19:57 -  is not that which is evil as against that which is good. But that which is perfect from that which is good.
20:12 -  For the good is the enemy of the perfect. And if Satan cannot distract us from blatant evil and ugly temptations and things that are vile
20:27 -  he will seduce us and try to distract us by that which is merely good. Will you set your face as a flint?
20:42 -  Will you be just as indifferent to that which is good as that which is blatantly evil? And will you recognize with Jesus
20:57 -  that there are only two sources for things? That which is born from above and that which is born from below.
21:12 -  Because you smell things that come from Satan, not from God. You smell of those things
21:27 -  which be of men. May God stab our hearts with this and make us to realize that nothing has changed.
21:42 -  These are the timeless and eternal categories. But we have not been as insistent upon the Lord
21:57 -  in looking to that which only comes from heaven. We have too often condescended to that which comes from men. Which in fact comes also from below.
22:24 -  You say, Art, what will it take if this was the mistake of Peter? Who one moment can be a vessel for the expression of a revelation
22:39 -  that came from the Spirit of Heaven. And the next moment something that came from below. What is our safety?
22:54 -  And how shall we miss such a snare? For that reason I would have you to turn to the Gospel of John and another episode that Jesus had
23:09 -  that might enlarge our understanding. It's a very familiar episode of a Pharisee who came by night
23:24 -  to see Jesus. Nicodemus in the third chapter. A ruler of the Jews in the Pharisee.
23:39 -  And he came to Jesus by night and he said, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him.
23:54 -  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.
24:09 -  How do you like that as an answer? Have you been astute enough, sharp enough to see how strange the answers are that Jesus gives to men?
24:29 -  Sometimes you're startled at how great is the disparity between the question and the answer. You say, why is that art? Because the question came from below.
24:44 -  It was human, merely curious, a distraction, but the answer came from above. Heavenly, and it's not related to that question.
24:59 -  Are you giving that kind of answer to men? Are you giving heavenly answers to earthly questions? Or are you fixed at the same low plateau
25:14 -  as those who ask you? And feel that you have some obligation to appease their curiosity? There's not been enough heavenly answers
25:29 -  because we have responded to men at their own level and missed, therefore, heavenly confrontations. Yes, but after you realize that Jesus was taking quite a risk.
25:44 -  He may well have built a great wall and missed his opportunity because this is a ruler of the Jews,
25:59 -  a very significant man of influence, and what a catch for the kingdom he would have been. I think Jesus should have asked him the four spiritual questions.
26:15 -  Do you know that God has a plan for your life? He was willing to risk the loss and so also must you.
26:30 -  Because if your motives are so low, so tinged with expediency, there's that word again,
26:45 -  with a desire for a certain result, you may well miss the heavenly purpose of God. If something is to be born on the earth
27:00 -  which is holy, sinless and pure, not only must the act and the speaking come from heaven, but the motive also.
27:15 -  Is there anything that has more corrupted modern evangelism than the self-seeking desires of men? Wanting to put an end to the self-seeking desires of men
27:31 -  wanting to put another notch in their belt and have another trophy, look what I saved. Or maybe their activity was the result
27:46 -  of some kind of drivenness, some compulsion to win souls. To appease some kind of sickly conscience.
28:02 -  I'll tell you much of that is going on nowadays. Because our lives are not right. Because we know intuitively we're not walking fully in the light.
28:17 -  We think somehow we can compensate for that by doing something for God. Is there a more frequent question than that?
28:32 -  What are you doing for the Lord? I guess I'm going to be doing something. And therefore we do not wait
28:47 -  for that which originates from God in His own time, for His own purpose. That that which comes as the result of that
29:02 -  is holy, sinless and pure. I wish I had the time to take you back to the advent of Jesus. That had to come first with a one who would come before,
29:17 -  John the Baptist. Do you remember the circumstances of his birth? He came to a couple who were barren and stricken with years.
29:32 -  What a stigma for a Jewish couple to bear in that generation. Because if you were sterile and barren,
29:47 -  the conclusion was that somehow there was secret sin in your life. That God had closed your womb. It would be a humiliation for any Jew.
30:02 -  What then for a man like Zechariah who was a priest. And suffered this reproach all his life long. Until when he was stricken with years.
30:17 -  There came a particular moment. He was in the cross of his priestly duties. When he was met at the right side of the altar
30:32 -  by an angel. Who announced to him that the barrenness was to be ended. That one was to be born through his wife, Elizabeth.
30:47 -  Who would be the forerunner of the Messiah Himself. What an interesting beginning. For bringing into the world the Holy One of Israel.
31:02 -  That God would choose such a couple as this for the forerunner. That God would choose such a couple as this for the forerunner. Who were barren and stricken with years.
31:17 -  Who were barren and stricken with years. But never ceased petitioning God in their prayer. The angels said your prayers have been heard in heaven.
31:32 -  And six months to the day after the birth of that John. The same angel visited Mary. The same angel visited Mary.
31:47 -  And so began the conception of Jesus Himself. Interesting what has happened to Christmas. Such an orgy of buying and having.
32:02 -  Such an orgy of buying and having. Christmas parties and revelries. Department stores all over the world looking for this season to make their profits.
32:17 -  Christians themselves entering into the merriment. Christians themselves entering into the merriment. And all together losing the significance of the event.
32:32 -  And all together losing the significance of the event. And all together losing the significance of the event. An opportunity to be reminded of the only way by which holy things come into the earth.
32:47 -  An opportunity to be reminded of the only way by which holy things come into the earth. It must have their origin in heaven. It must have their origin in heaven.
33:01 -  And come into earth by birth. Jesus answered him and said, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
33:11 -  Accept the man be born again. He cannot see the kingdom of God. How many of us have had such a birth to commence our spiritual life?
33:35 -  And never again considered that the means by which our spiritual life began is the only means by which it can continue.
33:51 -  Moment by moment. In that which is born from above and not from below.
34:02 -  Peter lost sight of that. And something was born in him of which Jesus had to say, Get thee behind me, Satan.
34:15 -  How consistently must we give ourselves only to that which is born from above? Consistently. Moment by moment.
34:31 -  What a tension. What a demand. This is more than what can be reasonably expected for a disciple.
34:44 -  This must go beyond mere obedience. Your life is for lovers only. Whose attention is always turned to heaven.
34:59 -  Who would never condescend to spread themselves out. Who would never condescend to spread themselves out. And would stand that something fleshy, something aft is born in himself.
35:21 -  Because it's convenient. Because it brings a result. Only that which is born from above.
35:29 -  How dense even our ears are. That Jesus has to say verily, verily. How pointed is his statement.
35:44 -  How we need to underline the word must. Must be born from above. Must. For in the sixth verse that which is born of the flesh is flesh.
35:59 -  And that which is born of the spirit is spirit. The wind blows where it comes and where it goes. The wind blows where it wants and where it hears its sound.
36:11 -  But you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. How many of us have come to that maturity. This kind of discipline in God.
36:24 -  This kind of discipline in God. That we can be virginal and chaste vessels for God. That the spirit can blow through us where it will.
36:38 -  That the spirit can blow through us where it will. That the spirit can blow through us where it will. So we don't have to ask where it came from.
36:47 -  And we don't have to see where it's going. We don't have to see the result of it. To have the assurance and the satisfaction that it was from God.
37:02 -  We leave that with him. The wind bloweth where it listeth. And we simply are the agency and the instrument, the virginal channel.
37:16 -  And we simply are the agency and the virginal channel. Through which it passes. How many of us are greedy to see the result of our obedience.
37:33 -  We've got to have a personal sense of assurance that God was with us. We've got to see some result for our activity. And because we have this kind of urgency.
37:50 -  It's a kind of a voluptuous desire. It's sensual. It's sensual for long.
37:57 -  It's fleeting. Earthly. Devilish.
38:00 -  That we move easily into manipulating to see and to guarantee that there will be some result. If something is to be born of the spirit. It has got to come through a virgin.
38:15 -  Whose only response is this. Let it be unto me according to thy word. I don't know how I'm going to be able to explain this.
38:30 -  I don't know how I'm going to be able to explain this. I don't even think that I can. That doesn't matter to me.
38:40 -  I'm willing to suffer the reproach for this. I'm willing to suffer the reproach for this. Let the Holy Ghost fill me.
38:48 -  Let the Holy Ghost fill me. Let me be swollen with God. Let me be swollen with God.
38:54 -  In a way that cannot be explained to men. In a way that cannot be explained to men. Let me suffer the humiliation in the reproach.
39:00 -  Let me suffer the humiliation in the reproach. And I'm willing even to suffer the death. And I'm willing even to suffer the death.
39:10 -  Have you ever realized that that's what Mary was saying? When she said let it be unto me according to thy word? What was the penalty in the law for a maiden of Israel found enough to be a virgin?
39:30 -  The penalty for a maiden of Israel found enough to be a virgin? To be taken to the doorstep of her father's house. To be taken to the doorstep of her father's house.
39:45 -  And there to be stoned to death. And there to be stoned to death. By her fathers, her brothers and the men of the community.
39:53 -  By her fathers, her brothers and the men of the community. Let it be unto me according to thy word. Let it be unto me according to thy word.
40:01 -  Jesus was not concerned for the consequence. Jesus was not concerned for the consequence. What if his answer bewildered Nicodemus?
40:11 -  What if his answer bewildered Nicodemus? What if he lost the golden opportunity to win a very significant soul? What if he lost the opportunity to lose an important soul?
40:25 -  Even for him the Spirit lists the way it willed. And he could not tell where it came from nor where it was going. He didn't have to.
40:39 -  He didn't have to know. His obedience was not contingent upon his knowing. He never originated anything out of himself.
40:55 -  The words that he spoke he received from his father. And if his father was not speaking, he was not speaking either. Have you ever considered what would have been the result if he had ever once spoken out of himself?
41:10 -  Have you ever considered what would have been the result if he had ever once spoken out of himself? He would have destroyed the credibility of the Scriptures. He would have destroyed the credibility of the Scriptures.
41:31 -  He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. Isaiah 53,7 Isaiah 53,7
41:42 -  He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He was abused, but he let himself be oppressed and he did not open his mouth. He was abused, but he let himself be oppressed and he did not open his mouth.
42:07 -  What are we standing for if someone is going to stand on our toes? There is something about our flesh being injured that really provokes us to speak. To speak defensively and on behalf of our interests that are now being offended and abused.
42:30 -  He was afflicted, oppressed, yet he opened not his mouth. What a sublime obedience to God the Father! What a sublime obedience to God the Father!
42:46 -  Despite all provocation, had he opened it but once, had he broken this necessary silence, had he contradicted this prophetic requirement,
43:03 -  had he contradicted this prophetic requirement, he would have destroyed in one stroke the validity of all the prophetic Scriptures and the credibility of the entire Scripture itself
43:22 -  by one inopportune speaking. How would you like to live? As if your obedience was just as crucial
43:39 -  that one inopportune speaking from you, that one inopportune speaking from you, one remark that was not originated from heaven,
43:55 -  that had its origin from below, and found a place in you to give it expression
44:05 -  would be sufficient to destroy some enormous thing in God. You know how we ought to live? As if this were so.
44:18 -  We had a precious lunch today, Paul and Wilbert. It was a wonderful and rich time of sharing. You ought to be much more such opportunity for the travelling ministers of God
44:35 -  and the leaders in the places to which they come. I shared with them something that happened to me some months ago on an airplane. That's where I catch up reading on my magazines, Time, Newsweek,
44:54 -  what's happening in the world, and it's sick and pathetic from cover to cover. There's economics, politics, social life, culture, religion.
45:09 -  It's sick from cover to cover. Whether it's politics, culture, social life, it's all sick. It's an expression of degradation and hopelessness.
45:26 -  I was reading an article by an economist, a secular economist. I read an article by a world-renowned economist, and I came to this one line.
45:39 -  He said, what happens, we have come to such a complexity and pitch in the economic relations in the world, that whatever happens anywhere in the world,
45:58 -  affects everything, everywhere. I almost blasted out of my seat, went right through the roof of the plane. What an enormous statement.
46:15 -  Truly, the children of darkness are wiser than the children of life. How much better do they understand than we? That whatever happens anywhere,
46:31 -  affects everything, everywhere. If that's true for the kingdom of darkness, how much more true in the kingdom of light,
46:43 -  as we come to the very end and conclusion of the age. God has an intricate and intertwined purpose in the earth. How dare we initiate our own activities?
47:14 -  How dare we do something because it is merely good? Because it seems a good idea, or we like it, or we have the enablement,
47:28 -  I remember a brother in Jewish ministry. He was at a conference of messianic Jewish leaders. He showed us a full page ad that he had placed in the New York Times.
47:47 -  He even boasted it cost six thousand dollars. I was impressed. And it had all kinds of inflammatory questions and answers,
47:57 -  and quite a piece of religious propaganda. It was really good. I said, to whom did you submit that idea?
48:14 -  I might as well have been someone who had come from another planet. My question was greeted with such a stony look of perplexity, to submit it to no one, of course.
48:28 -  It was my idea. I thought it was good. We had the money, so we did it.
48:38 -  I can tell you that it grieved the heart of God. I don't care how good it is. Was it born from above?
48:48 -  I don't know. I don't care how good it is. Was it born from above or from below?
48:58 -  What was the origin of its motive? Was it out of man or out of God? Did it come in God's moment of time?
49:10 -  Anything that happens anywhere affects everything everywhere? I can multiply these things. Christendom is a mess.
49:22 -  We're getting on the tangle of conflicting ministries and ambitions and designs. From men who will not and cannot wait for the Holy Ghost. To speak again into the congregation.
49:39 -  Separate unto me. Not unto Jewish ministry. Not unto the needs that are everywhere about you.
49:52 -  Not unto the needs that are everywhere about you. Not unto the needs that are everywhere about you. Not unto the needs that are everywhere about you.
50:04 -  Unto me is the only safe place of separation. For the work whereunto I have called them. That was the beginning of a true and pure apostolic act.
50:18 -  That was the beginning of a true and pure apostolic act. God calling men explicitly by name. Who were sent forth by the laying on of hands.
50:37 -  So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went. I wouldn't want to go forth under any other auspices. The result will be deadly.
50:54 -  If it has not its origin in God. In God's own time. By God's own means.
51:04 -  It's interesting where these men were when the Holy Ghost spoke into the congregation. They were fasting and ministering unto the Lord. You think that that was an accident?
51:21 -  Was it a coincidence? Or was it a condition for which God himself was waiting? He found men in the place of worship.
51:34 -  Ministering unto the Lord together. Just as much content to remain there. As to go.
51:46 -  Then it was safe to call them. I remember I was about to begin one of our overseas trips. Seven weeks Yugoslavia, Hungary, Eastern Europe, Israel.
52:05 -  I don't think it would be an exaggeration to call it an apostolic journey. And the Lord had quickened to me that I was to take one of the young brothers from our community.
52:23 -  I remember asking him some time shortly before our departure. What if even at this late moment I would have said that you're not to go? That I should choose another in your place.
52:42 -  He said, Art, it's all the same to me. To go or not to go? Good, I said it's safe then to take you.
52:54 -  Are you that separated unto God? That separated from yourself? That you'd be just as much content to remain ministering unto the Lord?
53:10 -  As to be sent. We will not wait. Because we're too impatient to do our own thing.
53:22 -  Because we don't love him sufficiently. That we initiate our own activity. We don't wait for that which is born from above.
53:42 -  Jesus said to the Pharisee, if I tell you earthly things and you don't understand them, how shall I tell you heavenly things? This is a heavenly thing. You must be born from above.
54:11 -  That's not only a statement for the beginning of the spiritual life. It's a statement of its continuation. That's not only a statement for the beginning of the spiritual life.
54:25 -  That's a statement of its continuation. That's not only a statement for the beginning of the spiritual life. But that's how it goes about the progress of it.
54:37 -  Moment by moment. It is a must. For every act.
54:43 -  For every word. For every obedience. For every plan and design.
54:51 -  It must be born from above. It must. Verily, verily, I say unto you.
55:01 -  Art, I've never seen this portion of scripture in that connection. I only saw this as a tool and a device for evangelism. Just to the unsaved.
55:19 -  Well that shows how Pharisaic you are. What do you mean Pharisaic? Wasn't that just a religious party 2000 years ago in the time of Jesus?
55:33 -  It's an eternal category. A certain kind of mentality. A certain kind of religious disposition of heart and mind.
55:43 -  That is fixed and mechanical. That puts things in little boxes and categories. That is so assured of itself and so self-assured and competent.
55:59 -  Did you catch that in the second verse of this chapter? We know that Thou art a man sent from above. We know that Thou art a man sent from above.
56:09 -  Did you catch that in the second verse of this chapter? We know that Thou art a man sent from God. That's always symptomatic of a Pharisaical mindset.
56:27 -  We know, we know. And the truth of the matter is, we don't know as we ought to know. We are not sufficiently full of tremblings.
56:45 -  We are not disposed to wait. We don't sufficiently distrust our own human motivations. We don't look with a proper suspicion upon things which come from the earth and from man from below.
57:09 -  We don't know. And there is no one who is more abusive of God in the realm of the Holy Spirit
57:23 -  than those who most proudly think to celebrate it. Namely Pentecostals and Charismatics. Namely Pentecostals and Charismatics.
57:37 -  Who have so abused the Spirit of God. Cheap views. Exercises of the spiritual gifts in terms of improving the quality of meetings.
57:59 -  Thinking that the Holy Spirit is given for our convenience. To renew our denominations. Who talk about the Spirit and say, have you got it?
58:13 -  But when it comes to the actual substance and practice of their lives. Don't know what it means to walk in the Spirit. And have never even considered
58:29 -  that it's a moment by moment proposition. Make decisions out of their own heads. Determine whether something is right or wrong on the basis of its logical reasons.
58:45 -  And whose attention is not turned to heaven. The whole atmosphere of their congregations has nothing of the awe and fear of God.
58:57 -  Has nothing of the awe and fear of God. Or the sense that the Spirit which they profess to celebrate is holy.
59:11 -  That thing which shall be born of you shall be holy, sinless and pure. The Holy Spirit shall be holy, sinless and pure.
59:27 -  The Holy Spirit shall be holy, sinless and pure. Let it be unto me according to thy word.
59:39 -  It was not just a picture of a certain historic birth but an eternal pattern of which we've had no sense
59:53 -  we've not waited for the sixth month. We've gone off in ourselves hoping that God would come behind
01:00:05 -  to applaud and to bless our endeavor. We simply have not been virginal enough to withhold ourselves only for one
01:00:19 -  and not yield to any other kind of conception. You've gone whoring after other Gods. Is the cry of God to the Israel of old.
01:00:37 -  He might say it again today. We're guilty of fornication with the spirits of this world.
01:00:49 -  The spirit of convenience. Does it work? Does it succeed?
01:01:01 -  We think it's a good idea. Do you despise good? Only in proportion as you love him who is perfect.
01:01:13 -  That good is as ugly to you as that which is blatantly evil. For it assuredly comes from the same source.
01:01:27 -  In the smell of that which comes not from God but from man. Get thee behind me Satan.
01:01:39 -  Have we let that sink into our hearing? Have we heard the verily verily of Jesus? Have we heard the verily verily of Jesus?
01:01:51 -  Have we understood the must? You must all be born from above. The wind blows where it will.
01:02:05 -  Have we been willing to wait for it and yield to it in its time, for its purpose, for its glory?
01:02:17 -  It's for virgins, undefiled. Undefiled. I can sum it up in a kind of a formula.
01:02:35 -  The issue of bringing into the earth a truly spiritual event. A spiritual act.
01:02:51 -  A spiritual word. The kind that affects eternity. Apostolic.
01:03:03 -  Touched by the glory of God. That will deeply affect things. The issue of that kind of spiritual event
01:03:15 -  is the issue of birth. Moment by moment. And the issue of birth
01:03:29 -  is the issue of conception. And the issue of conception is the issue of love.
01:03:39 -  How the Lord will not let me get away from this. Tough guy that I've been. Only concerned for the results of God.
01:03:53 -  The heroic acts and works. Love was for the others. It wasn't my subject and category.
01:04:05 -  Just manly obedience. This goes beyond mere obedience. Mere obedience will come to its end.
01:04:17 -  Mere obedience will exhaust itself. Mere obedience will fail. But bridal love.
01:04:29 -  First love. That keeps itself pure. That waits only for him.
01:04:39 -  To come in his time. And to receive him in his way. And to suffer the reproach of that conception.
01:04:49 -  Is for lovers only. And this in my opinion is where the holy sinless pure end time acts will come. There's a must.
01:05:09 -  There's a verily verily. But we've not seen it. Can I ask you a question tonight?
01:05:19 -  Of the two men who were in confrontation in John the third chapter. A proud pharisaical Jew. An expert and competent religionist.
01:05:35 -  With certain nice attributes who really wanted to learn something from Jesus. Or the Lord from heaven himself. Speaking answers as mysteries.
01:05:49 -  Willing to perplex men. Not ruled by having to see the result. The father's fool.
01:06:01 -  Speaking only that which is born from above. Speaking the mysteries of God. Giving a heavenly answer only.
01:06:15 -  Or opening not his mouth. Which of the two do you more closely resemble? We know, we know.
01:06:27 -  Or the Lord from heaven. I tell you I'm becoming very simple myself. And I'm also tending more and more to see things in terms of one or two.
01:06:41 -  Above or below. Spirit or flesh. The Lord from heaven.
01:06:55 -  Or the earthly Pharisee. That's how radical are the choices that are before us. Moment by moment.
01:07:07 -  I think it says somewhere that God is not mocked. That if we sow to the flesh. We shall have the flesh reap corruption.
01:07:25 -  But if we sow to the spirit. We shall sow to eternity. But if we sow to the spirit.
01:07:35 -  We shall sow to eternal life. How we need to have a perspective of heaven. To see from the eternal perspective.
01:07:51 -  That might temper our every act and word now. That when we come into the light of eternity. Will not find that so many of our works were born of the flesh.
01:08:05 -  Born from below. That were sown only unto corruption. And had no eternal life.
01:08:17 -  That were sown only unto corruption. And had no eternal value. Wanted by God.
01:08:31 -  For this last generation. Virgins undefiled. Who will wait on him only.
01:08:43 -  For his own moment and his own time. That that which may be born into the earth. Shall be holy, sinless and pure.
01:08:59 -  That's what it's going to take. It's the issue of love. That says let it be unto me.
01:09:13 -  A woman who was so impregnated with the Holy Ghost. Came and greeted this Elizabeth in whose womb John the babe was. Who leaped at the very voice of her salutation.
01:09:33 -  Who leaped at the very voice of her salutation. Who leaped at the very voice of her salutation. Who leaped at the very voice of her salutation.
01:09:47 -  When Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost. At the sound of the group of Mary. So it is with one who is swollen with the Holy Ghost.
01:10:03 -  Full of that which is born from above only. Virginal and chaste. And the sound of her voice.
01:10:17 -  Made the baby to leap. How there are things that need to leap in our generation. That have somehow not been stirred.
01:10:33 -  Unaffected by our programs. Waiting for this. That which comes down from above.
01:10:47 -  Born of the Spirit of God. Moment by moment. You must be born from above.
01:11:01 -  Your acts must be born from above. Your speech and your witness must be born from above. Your witness must be born from above.
01:11:13 -  Must, verily, verily. I say unto thee. Are we hearing?
01:11:23 -  Are we repenting? For all those things to which we gave ourselves. That were only human.
01:11:37 -  That tasted of man. And not of God. How much do we also deserve the rebuke of Jesus.
01:11:51 -  Get thee behind me, Satan. That we have given ourselves over to the work of the enemy. And done these things even in the name of God.
01:12:07 -  It would be better that we were atheists. Who had never taken the name of the Lord in our minds. And in our ignorance contended against him.
01:12:23 -  That we should be our well-meaning intentions. And kind affections. Equally oppose his holy will.
01:12:37 -  Let this be far from you. Why did Peter say that? Because his heart was saying also.
01:12:45 -  Let it be far from me. Because if he must go that way. What then shall we suffer who also bear his name?
01:12:57 -  And how much of our fleshly acts has exactly that motive? To save us from the suffering. That will come in obedience to the pure spirit of God.
01:13:17 -  The result of which will always bring you to a cross. Many of us are still saying let it be far from you. Let it be far from me.
01:13:33 -  Then Jesus said unto his disciples. If anyone will come after me. Let him deny himself.
01:13:45 -  And take up his cross and follow me. For whoever will save his life shall lose it. But whosoever will lose it, his life for my sake shall find it.
01:14:01 -  You want to know how to be saved from the humiliation that Peter experienced? Not in one moment to say something that is born from above
01:14:09 -  and in the next moment to say something born from below? There is only one safe place. It is to lose your life.
01:14:25 -  If anyone will come after me. Let him deny himself. And take up his cross and follow me.
01:14:35 -  A Christian writer said any man who ever took up his cross. Went up to a certain hill. And was never seen from again.
01:14:49 -  And was never seen from again. A Christian writer said any man who ever took up his cross. Went up to a certain hill.
01:14:59 -  And was never seen from again. It is the only place for a Christian. It will never lay down and keep quiet.
01:15:11 -  It will never be able to discipline it. Just when you think you have it under control. Just when you think you are being spiritual.
01:15:21 -  Go out to Christ the son of the living God. A minute later you are putting your foot in your own mouth. The Lord takes you up to the mouth of transfiguration.
01:15:35 -  You see God transfigured with Moses and with Elijah. And your flesh is saying let us make for these three booths. The Lord says that he must suffer and die.
01:15:53 -  You say let it be far from you. He says before the cock crows three times you will deny me Christ. The flesh says though all the world deny you yet will I deny you never.
01:16:09 -  What are you going to do with flesh like that? There is only one answer for it. Death. Crucify it.
01:16:19 -  If any man will come after me. Let him deny himself. That being dead.
01:16:31 -  That being dead and hid with Christ and God. That being dead and hidden with Christ and God. That he has no life unto himself.
01:16:45 -  Until his life is revealed. From heaven. How much heaven have we shown the world?
01:16:55 -  Holy things. Born from above. How much have we trafficked in the spirit of the world?
01:17:05 -  Doing things like them. Grimy and sweaty. Fleshly and human.
01:17:15 -  Only merely good. But not perfect. The good is the enemy of the perfect.
01:17:25 -  There is a must children. Verily verily he says unto us. You must be born again.
01:17:35 -  Must be born from above. Must be born of the spirit. And so is every man that is born of God.
01:17:45 -  And so is every act that is born of God. And so is every word that is born of God. This kind of an obedience.
01:17:59 -  Is an obedience unto death. For those who love the Lord of heaven so. And despise that which is from below.
01:18:11 -  And they recognize that there is only one safe place. It is to take up their cross. And not be seen from again.
01:18:27 -  And not be heard from again. And not be heard from again. That their speaking is his speaking.
01:18:39 -  Your acts are his acts. Holy and sinless and pure. For they come from above.
01:18:51 -  Shall we pray for this?
