The Wilderness Call

00:00 -  Thor. It's mud up to the kneecaps. We've had to leave our cars off the property in order to walk in. The roads are not negotiable. The mosquitoes, this mild, nothing, you've seen nothing. You haven't seen our winters. I mean, it's a...
00:14 -  I don't want to exaggerate it, but the Lord has blessed us and provided everything needful. But nevertheless, when you compare it with the lifestyles and affluence and flicking of switches to get the proper air conditioning,
00:29 -  temperature and inconvenience and that, and cars that will start up at will, we have to pray that our cars will start even when they're plugged in all night. We've had a car plugged in with a woman that was expected to give birth and
00:42 -  indeed it came in the like 4 a.m. and we did get the engine started, but the transmission was completely frozen. We could not shift gears. As it is, she almost died from hemorrhaging. So you live here with, you take certain risks that would
00:58 -  not be your experience if you lived in other places. So wilderness, yeah. I got one word that I think David Wilkinson said and I think since we're on that, it's in Luke 3, 2. The third chapter, the second verse, it says, Ananias and Caapas being the high priests and it says the word of God came unto John, the son of Zechariah, Ethan and Willis.
01:23 -  In other words, he was saying it passed by them and the word of God came all the way down to John. It's something like, these guys are in a certain status, but the word of God came all the way. What was that, Luke 3? 3, 2. David Wilkinson mentioned that one.
01:43 -  He said when he really read that, he read it less than deeply. Because when you read it at first, you don't care. That's a good, beautiful verse. It's something that the word of God came, Ananias and Caapas were high priests.
01:58 -  They were supposed to be the ones that went in and met God. Here is the word of God passed through them and came to John and Willis. The minute I heard it, something deep in me just really corresponded to it.
02:16 -  God is speaking to John, Ethan and Willis and those who are in that place. Just one thought I had as well is the manifestation of power on the other side of the wilderness. When you read through the Old Testament of Israel in the wilderness, you notice that all their struggles are coming from something eternal.
02:45 -  Whereas when they come out of the wilderness and see across the Jordan, the enemy is on the outside and they're in a place of being able to fight. God still uses his power, but there's something that they're not struggling on the inside. The same manifestation is with John and Jesus. When Jesus comes out of the wilderness, he comes out with power.
03:03 -  It's the same thing with John the Baptist. When he comes out of the wilderness, he comes out with a message. People say, what shall we do? And wasn't it the same with Jesus? What shall we do then, would you say? If we're wandering around or stumbling around and wondering why we're not manifesting the power of God, it's probably because we haven't come out of the wilderness.
03:29 -  We're still in a place of testing. It's good to note the scriptures that are being referred to in Luke 4, so long as we're in Luke, verse 1 of chapter 4. Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
03:48 -  As I'm suggesting also, Elijah was led in, John the Baptist was led in by the Spirit, obedience to the Spirit for unnecessary wilderness experience that has its culmination in verse 14. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit, intergalally.
04:07 -  So somewhere between going in and coming out, the issue of power was established. And this has been, I think, an embarrassment in our charismatic movement, that somehow having the baptism of the Holy Spirit does not automatically of itself confer power.
04:27 -  I think there's a lot of phony baloney and highfalutin, looking on no hands and blowing people down, so-called, maybe it's the bad breath that makes them to go down, but I doubt very much if that's the power of God being demonstrated. But I'll tell you, there's another power available if you're not too discriminating.
04:43 -  If you have a professional and ministerial itch to prove something and demonstrate something, and it's not God, there's another who will accommodate you very quickly. The embarrassing and painful and dangerous thing is that great numbers of people are so entranced by any demonstration of power
05:01 -  that they, without weighing or sensing, approve and validate and assume it must be God. Everything that is demonstrated in the character of that one who's making the demonstration is not Godly. There's not a corresponding character in keeping with the degree of power being manifested.
05:20 -  Something is not right in Denmark. Something is rotten in Denmark when there's not a character that corresponds to the power. Great grace was upon them all, and with power gave the Apostles testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
05:35 -  And strangely, I was called to be a speaker, a full gospel thing, by a couple who came in ministry who are in the power demonstration of people going over and so-called healings and all of that, and the message God gave me was completely contrary.
05:47 -  But one of the things I remember about it was it was the message on the danger of deception predicated on the fascination for power that characterizes our charismatic generation. And I said, will God trust power again except to be a apostolic character to those to whom it is given?
06:08 -  Because if there's anything that distinguishes an apostolic or prophetic character, it's being a vessel for the display of the power of God without the corresponding vanity and self-exaltation that will appropriate the glory to itself
06:25 -  or build on that basis a national ministry or any other kind of thing. The wilderness men are obscure. They're hidden. They don't come forth until they're called forth. And when their purposes are finished, they're either taken up to heaven or their heads are lopped off.
06:42 -  There's no continuing benefit to themselves for the display of God in them. That's part of the wilderness. There's something shaped in the wilderness that has to do with that character that does not need applause, does not need acknowledgement,
06:58 -  will not appropriate to itself, for itself, anything that is passing through it that comes by the power of God. Our very pre-denated statement and one of these messages, you know the power of God is the love of the Father.
07:15 -  Of course, 1 Corinthians 13 says you only can have all those things, but unless we're in the character of that love of the Father, then it's nothing. Well, all of this I think answers to the question about the powerlessness of our contemporary church.
07:29 -  Despite all of the preoccupation and interest about power and all of the giddy running after it, there really is a scandalously, a scandalous absence of power if you're really honest about it. And it must be that God is waiting for that wilderness character.
07:51 -  So what is it between verses 1 and verses 14 that Jesus himself is led by the Spirit, being full of the Holy Ghost, into the wilderness and returned from the wilderness in the power of the Spirit? Something is transacted in that 40 days, which corresponds to the 40 years of Israel in the wilderness
08:14 -  and our own wilderness experience. Can I raise a rhetorical question? One that needs not be now answered. How many of us know that we have had a wilderness experience?
08:24 -  Have you been through a wilderness experience? And are you willing so to be placed? And is it a once and for all or a very frequent, if not a continuous requirement of those who have a call of this kind?
08:44 -  And it's a voluntary thing. He was led by the Spirit, but he wasn't yanked by the scruff of his neck. I think where the charismatic movement stopped was at verse 1.
08:56 -  At a baptism in the Holy Spirit, but they were unwilling to be led into the wilderness. But immediately on that basis began to promote a certain lifestyle, a certain denominational upsurge, a certain plethora of ministries that applauded men
09:13 -  and founded institutions in their name. Can I interject something right here? Yeah.
09:22 -  I remember going back when my ministry first started. I had a couple of them, some saints that were going to promote me in ministry. Here we were standing at a big building on a main street.
09:40 -  They were saying, let's pray about it. We prayed a couple of weeks or so and just kept praying and asking the Lord to be with us in this. But as I stood outside that building one day, my brother-in-law owned the building.
09:55 -  And it was beautiful. It was on a main street. And the Lord quickly gave me a verse by watching me say, that the Lord will never give you something to do that you can do.
10:08 -  And so it was easy for me to do what was before me. I mean, it's something that you can have to do on your own. And I just said it just couldn't be of God, you know,
10:18 -  because it just saved me from going into ministry and taking money and going through all that It was really something that we were going to do. And the Lord really never gave us any compensation.
10:29 -  So, you know, it's what people really get the invitation, they get the opportunity and they take it because it's going to be a road to success. Something that is outside our American experience but is a commonplace in Europe
10:44 -  is that most ministers in the church systems of Europe are federal employees. They are government employees. Their salary is not paid by their church, it's paid by the state.
10:56 -  And the people pay a church tax so that atheists who don't give a rap, who will never knock on the door of the step of a church, will pay the tax just merely to be on the rolls,
11:09 -  which gives them a right to be buried and that their children should have infant baptisms. They want to have the benefit of certain religious things. It's a whole system by which the clergy becomes a professional class
11:24 -  and is compromised at its very root. How do you bite the hand that feeds you? And not only feeds you during your adult life, but also retires you very comfortably.
11:36 -  If I'm not mistaken, they retire with full salary. And the salary as a government employee is not the kind of piddling thing that many of our ministers know who are working with small congregations
11:48 -  that can barely sustain them. They retire handsomely. They are trained by the state. The faculty of theology is in the state university.
11:59 -  And the whole system of prestige and acknowledgement has to be on the basis of the kind that secular and academic men also subscribe. You see that there's something working to produce a class of men
12:15 -  who minister in a way that never sound a cry, never raise a standard, never challenge the status quo because they are being totally sustained by it. We have a greater opportunity in our own churches where a pastor is supported through the congregation.
12:36 -  But I think even there there's a recognition that you don't dare offend those who provide your sustenance. The book, The Spirit of Truth, which is now going to be published in a few months, had its inspiration in this one thing, that in a certain visit to Canada on a Sunday off,
12:55 -  a Jewish brother said, Art, you've got to hear our pastor. He's a wonderful preacher. I said, Oh, praise God, there's a famine for the word of the Lord in the land. And I went running with expectation.
13:07 -  And there I was up in the balcony bracing myself for this great experience that would come and already somewhat distressed as I looked around and saw the signs of boredom and kids and together elbowing each other and husbands and wives looking like they were living the truth.
13:20 -  Something was amiss. There was not a reality that I would expect for a man who's a man of the word, congregation of such a man.
13:27 -  And then the word began to come. And I'm listening to the word and I'm nodding and giving approval to something that is doctrinally sound and biblical. But my guts are going haywire.
13:41 -  Every alarm system is ringing and I'm not at all. What this disparity between my head and my and my gut. And I finally realized what it was.
13:50 -  He was speaking correctly, but the spirit of the speaking was violently opposed to the words themselves. His word was calling for something radical based on the biblical text. But his spirit was saying to the congregation, now don't get rattled.
14:08 -  Don't panic. Don't think that I'm intending for you to take this seriously. This is just a sermon.
14:13 -  Remember, we have an unspoken agreement. You provide me with my security, my parsonage, my salary, my retirement. And I'll provide you with a good biblical message every Sunday.
14:25 -  That's when the Lord broke upon me the issue of the spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive. The spirit of truth is more than just the truth. He was speaking, quote, the truth, but he was not speaking it with the spirit of truth.
14:41 -  It was not the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Remember what the widow woman said. Now I know by this that thou art a man of God and the word in thy mouth is truth through and through.
14:54 -  You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. And maybe what we're looking at at modern Christendom are the tens upon tens of unnumbered multitudes and congregations of people in bondage hearing a technical word of biblical correctness,
15:11 -  but contradicted by a spirit of compromise. And therefore it's not the whole truth. And if it's not the whole truth, it's not the truth at all.
15:19 -  And therefore they're not being set free. So the function of the prophet is to come into the midst of that kind of subterfuge and blow the whistle, both in word and in presence and in deed,
15:36 -  to not allow that kind of subterfuge to continue in the name of Christianity, but to reveal it for the pretense that it is, the sham and the hoax that it is, by a word of such a kind that is like a knife that cuts through the whole deception.
15:53 -  And people gasp and come alive. Why, there's a woman in this room who said to me in the first hearing of me, who had been a notable charismatic for her adult life,
16:01 -  she said, now that I've heard you want, she said, I feel like I've been deceived up till now. I've always remembered that. That's what it's going to require.
16:11 -  And can it come from anyone except one that is brought up out of the wilderness place? Because if you're in that system, you become sublimated, attenuated to the half-truth, to the way of life. You get the slap on the back, you're one of the boys, you're invited to the conferences,
16:29 -  you go out afterwards for a meal and you chuckle together. And there's a fraternity of hail fellow, well-met. And I've seen those fraternities, not from the inside but from the outside.
16:41 -  I've come down in hotels where there have been international full gospel conferences and I was one of the secondary speakers in a physical contrast to the flamboyant of the others. And I would walk into the dining hall and there would be a table full of these prosperous
16:58 -  and affluent nationally known men and they'd look up for a moment and give me a raised eyebrow and then go back and I'd take a table somewhere at the other end of the room feeling like a turd. Are you willing for that?
17:14 -  You know, there's something in us that craves recognition by people who are where the action is. And until God brings you out of your obscurity and hiddenness, there is no action to speak of. There is no distinction.
17:30 -  And then when he does employ you, instead of the distinction that would have been self-honoring and flattering, you become a reproach and a stink. As my brother had to tell me, David, who came yesterday from Israel,
17:42 -  you're being called a false prophet in the land. So we're examining something of such a critical nature for the last days. I have not talked of it in any detail, though I've mentioned already this morning again.
17:59 -  I will meet with them in the wilderness of the nations. Ezekiel 20 and Hosea 2 and other places. I'm sorry? Ezekiel 20.
18:13 -  In fact, we can look at it for a moment if you don't mind the interruption. That the Israel that began its national career in the wilderness ends it. Must go through it again before it's of any use to God in blessing the nations.
18:35 -  Again, another sifting in a place where the flesh has no disposition to be. You don't find happy accommodations there. And I can tell you guys I am not speaking metaphorically.
18:52 -  I want to reiterate that this is actual. They are going to be cast out into the nations. They are the outcasts of Israel and the dispersed of Judah.
19:02 -  However, my poor friend David, God bless him, doesn't want to contemplate such a scenario. You heard our own prayers for him. There was a cry, at least in my own spirit,
19:12 -  that what he's going back to is going to be ultimately and soon a devastation. And he's so wide-eyed, he's so identified with the nation, he's so patriotic. He wants it so much to be Zion.
19:24 -  But it's so yet not unlike Zion and never will be a Zion until it will be sifted and tried and tested through the wilderness. I forgot in which book of the Minor Prophets it says,
19:37 -  And I will sift them as one sifts corn in a sieve, and not one grain shall fall to the ground. This sifting through the wilderness,
19:51 -  the wilderness is such a grid, G-R-I-D. It has difficulties, it has burrs, it has physical struggle, testing of every kind, as we know from the experience of Israel at the first.
20:06 -  It will be so again at the end. That's Amos 9.9. I'm sorry?
20:11 -  Amos 9.9. I will sift them as one sifts corn in a sieve, one by one. This process is going to be so selective for God to find that remnant
20:22 -  that will endure and be established as the restored nation with another character entirely because of what confronts them and meets them in the wilderness place.
20:31 -  Ezekiel 20, verse 33, As I live, save the Lord God, surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you.
20:41 -  Here's the issue of the theocracy of God that must begin with his own nation, must begin first with his own church. The government shall be upon his shoulder before it can be to the nations.
20:56 -  And what was the last official statement? We will not have this man to rule over us. But in the last days, I will rule over you.
21:05 -  It'll take a fury poured out because you're not going to want it. You're a stiff necked. You're opinionated.
21:14 -  You have your own mindset, frame of reference. It'll take a fury poured out to uproot you from the place of affluence, culture, and comfort that you have enjoyed
21:29 -  to bring you to a place of confrontation and revelation that would never have been found in Montreal or Toronto or the high rise towers of Chicago, New York
21:40 -  or the other places where Jewish people want to be found. I will bring you out from the people, the same word people there means nations, goyim,
21:54 -  and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out.
22:01 -  I'll tell you, I'm not a great biblical scholar, but I'll say that any time I find the same phrase repeated in two verses, I'm alerted that God is wanting to say something acutely.
22:13 -  When he mentions fury poured out twice, you better believe that what it's indicating is a last day's anti-Semitic fury against the Jewish people,
22:24 -  such a blast of hatred and seeking for their life that they'll not be safe in Toronto or Montreal or Auckland or wherever it is they have found any degree of safety.
22:36 -  God will use this fiendish, satanic hatred to allow them to be driven to a place where he's waiting to meet them, the wilderness of the nations.
22:48 -  I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. I believe that this is so literal.
22:59 -  This is not poetry, and I wish you could have been with me as God has given me occasion to be in the wilderness place and places that are already being prepared.
23:12 -  I have actually been in a wilderness in Mexico with a brother with his four-wheel vehicle who has been charged with the mandate to plot a flight of escape for Jews
23:22 -  through the Sierra Madre Mountains, who held my name for seven years and called me and wrote me, and I kept putting him off. He sounded like some weirdo about escape and flight and refuge,
23:33 -  like some melodramatic stuff that's so opposed to my taste. Sounds like a movie scenario, and I didn't want him to come up to the community.
23:41 -  Who needs a harebrained character? You know, there's something about things Jewish that bring the characters out of the woodwork,
23:47 -  and so finally I couldn't put this guy off. I said, I'm coming to Springfield, Missouri. You'll meet me there, I'll meet with you.
23:53 -  He flew in, we flew in, sitting at a restaurant with Dan McConaughey, our pilot, and in walks this blond, blue-eyed boy,
24:00 -  slightly built, you know, a Gentile of the Gentiles. The moment I saw him, something leaped in my spirit like Elizabeth bearing John
24:09 -  at the salutation of Mary. No question, God's man, God's appointment. And we sat down and he said,
24:16 -  I've been holding your name for seven years. God has given me a mandate to establish an escape route, and you're one of five men that God has told me
24:26 -  will be related with me in this. He told me the names of the other, I knew the other men, every single one of them, a multimillionaire,
24:33 -  a pastor whom Shelley Folk has now replaced in Scotchdale, Arizona. This man has gone on to be now with the Lord.
24:40 -  A banker, substantial, reputable, serious man. We have met in this banker's high-rise club and talked together over this thing.
24:52 -  This young man has moved now from Phoenix. He's on the border of Mexico, directly south, in a little spot you can hardly find on the map,
25:02 -  and has a half-million-dollar vineyard. And when I visited him last, I've been there now two or three times,
25:10 -  I said, how did you come to this? The vines themselves, the plantings, cost over $3 or $4 each,
25:17 -  and he had over $50,000 to $100,000 of them. The last word in his Israeli drip irrigation system, and he said, Art, I had to have this.
25:26 -  I'm in such a location that if I don't have a valid occupation, I'm immediately suspect as being one in the drug thing, and I had to have it covered,
25:36 -  and the Lord has provided this. So on one of my trips with him, he took me in in the four-wheel vehicle
25:42 -  to show me segments of this escape route. I'll tell you, dear saints, I trembled that we ourselves would come out alive.
25:49 -  I never saw a cactus so high, 20 feet high, sand dunes, absolute desolate places, no water, the most primitive back wilderness places I had ever seen.
26:00 -  This is the path, he says. God has shown me this, this, and this. The man speaks Spanish.
26:06 -  He was an antiquarian, a museum curator who used to go in and find these Indian villages and find their artifacts and bring them to museums.
26:14 -  He has a remarkable knowledge of this whole, the most remote area, and I can tell you if I took the time
26:20 -  how many others I know personally that God has shown me are links in this. And remember why we came here?
26:28 -  When we lived in that 17-room house in New Jersey, and I came as a speaker 40 miles from here, and they said, Art, there's a property for sale.
26:35 -  Would you care to see it? I said, sure, why not? I was coming up to the boys' camp here that was bankrupt with a chain across it,
26:42 -  and I came out of the car, and I came over the chain, and my foot came down on the property, and the Lord spoke, Dominion, the name it now bears,
26:50 -  end-time teaching center, community, refuge. Those were the only words and exactly the words, and on the basis of that intimation,
27:03 -  I wouldn't even call it a still small voice, an intimation, a whisper of God. Everything was set in motion that radically altered
27:10 -  the whole fabric and makeup of my life. Living in New Jersey, my publisher's community, having some ministry with Catherine Coleman,
27:22 -  being on several of her national telecasts and radio programs and books being published, and I could have gone in a direction of increasing recognition
27:31 -  and ministry, and the Lord brings us here. Thinking that refuge meant persecuted saints in the last days until this young man came into my life
27:41 -  and something opened up for the Lord to show me, graphically, demonstrably, something is already in motion, places are being established.
27:50 -  I carry a photograph of a painting in my address book of a property in Oregon that shows Jews in the most bedraggled condition,
28:00 -  spent, broken, hunched over, fatigued, weary, hopeless, coming in straggling lines off the West Coast
28:10 -  through a backwoods place cut through where they put the telegraph poles or whatever it is, and they're coming into two barrack-like buildings
28:18 -  by a river that's called the Salmon River, a painting by a woman in the spirit who had never, ever seen that property.
28:24 -  I can tell you, I have been on that property. Those barracks exist, and the man who was commissioned
28:31 -  had been a high-flying wheeler-dealer in the Bahamas, ready to buy his own island, had his own commercial plane, boat,
28:37 -  I mean, the guy, and he had been a Christian as a kid, and the Lord stripped him to the bone, took him out of that whole thing,
28:44 -  reduced his life to nothing, and thrust him in that rural wilderness area in Oregon. And then, in the course of this time,
28:52 -  it unfolded that he wanted this built and that built before he even revealed to him that it was going to be for Jews in flight.
28:59 -  Dear Saints, I have to persuade my own community that this is not some romantic affinity of my own.
29:10 -  The fact of the matter is it violates my own taste. I don't like it. It sounds too melodramatic,
29:18 -  but this is absolutely authentic and true, and we're going to see it worldwide. I think I mentioned one time earlier when I was in New Zealand
29:26 -  why the Lord would be bringing me there when the action I would have thought would have been in Europe or other nations,
29:32 -  this little backwater island, and I think, well, how does that relate to the burden that God is giving me?
29:38 -  And one day sharing this very text in New Zealand, the Lord impressed me that New Zealand itself, the whole nation, is a wilderness among the nations.
29:47 -  That is to say, it's not in the main line. It's not in your places of prestige and affluence. It's a little back place,
29:55 -  but it may well be that the Lord has appointed that little place to be something that will be accommodating and receiving
30:01 -  numbers of Jewish people passing through, and I don't know from what parts of the world, but brace yourself for this.
30:07 -  It's coming, and it's going to take place in the wilderness nation, and here's the key thing that pertains to us,
30:13 -  and there I will meet with you face to face. And I know what that means. If they don't see the face of their God
30:25 -  in that crisis time, in the moment of their ultimate extremity, we miss the whole historic point
30:31 -  for which God is allowing a fury to be poured out upon them. If they just see us in some kind of
30:37 -  begrudging accommodation, well, I guess we've got to, and take you in,
30:43 -  and are irritated by them and the demand they make upon our food supply, which in those days may be sparse.
30:50 -  Maybe the economy has already broken and tottered, and we're struggling ourselves to subsist. And here comes this intrusion.
30:57 -  This is why I'm trembling over this property next door to us, this camp, that they say by the end of this month,
31:03 -  if the caretakers don't come up with the money, it's going to some wealthy man in Nebraska who's going to make a private home out of it
31:09 -  and tear down the lodge. Here's a building calculated to receive numbers of people that can house
31:18 -  200 or more comfortably, greater numbers than that, if you want to even put out beds
31:24 -  in that main dining hall in the all-purpose room. I've had a dream of Argentina.
31:30 -  I've never been to Latin America, where I came into an armory, and it was filled with cuts,
31:37 -  with evidence of people who had slept in it and had to abruptly leave and to go on to the next place.
31:45 -  And in the dream, the Lord is showing that it was Jews who had moved through that place, and that I was in Argentina.
31:52 -  So this is going to be global, worldwide, not only for Israel's sake, but for the nations through which they pass
31:59 -  and the church in the nations, an ultimate test of where we are in God at a time when this people will be
32:06 -  desperately pursued, hunted, and anyone who will identify with them, extend to them help and grace and comfort
32:12 -  will do so at the peril of their lives. And this is maybe the setup that gives us opportunity
32:18 -  not only to extend mercy that they might obtain mercy, but that they might be moved to jealousy
32:24 -  by a demonstration of an essentially Gentile church that is willing to extend themselves to them
32:31 -  at peril of their own lives. I could just hear them saying now, why are you doing this?
32:38 -  Don't you know the risk? Why are you willing? It's like Elijah stretching himself out
32:44 -  over that dead child, so much as to say, take my life for his. When they see our willingness
32:50 -  to extend our life for them, something has got to pop, something has got to go.
32:56 -  There I will meet with you face to face in the wilderness of nations. The farm that's right behind us,
33:02 -  a 120-acre property, I have had a vision, I'm not a man given to this often,
33:08 -  of three children laughing and playing and being happy, set back much further in
33:14 -  than our own property. And yet I had sought to purchase that years ago and it went right through our fingers.
33:20 -  A woman with whom I'd been negotiating related to Mam Broga. And we were talking about the purchase
33:26 -  of that property for months or just working out the final details and all of a sudden I learned
33:32 -  she's selling it to a young student at Bemidji State. And I said, boy, I heard
33:38 -  you're selling a property, we've been talking about it for months, how is it that you haven't given me an opportunity
33:44 -  to meet any other offer that's been given? Well, she began to mumble and I think she was being offered
33:50 -  21,000, I said, we'll give you 24, of course I didn't have it but I believe the Lord will exceed the offer.
33:56 -  No, she said, I made up my mind and all of a sudden the Lord said, cool it.
34:02 -  Just a peace came over me. I said, okay, and walked away. That property has been sold, I think,
34:08 -  at least three times since. It's now worth about 80,000 from 21,000. And yet I know that I know that I know
34:14 -  that one day Jewish children will be on that property laughing and being happy
34:20 -  as some relief and an escape from pursuit and being hunted.
34:26 -  And I don't know how the Lord's going to cover us. Whether there'll be an actual way in which men who have taken
34:32 -  Bibles into Iron Curtain countries went right through armed guards who didn't even see
34:38 -  their Bibles. Or the fact that we're on an Indian reservation here. And that somehow in the outworking
34:44 -  of things, these Indian tribes, because of the temper of things, will have an autonomy and will be like
34:50 -  a little Switzerland under an Indian national. This is the Chippewa tribes headquarters right here in Cast Lake.
34:56 -  And that will cover us. I don't know how the Lord's going to do it. Or there'll be a regional revival where all the believers round about
35:02 -  will be in the purposes of God. There'll be nothing to conceal. We'll all be working together. I don't know. Although there have been dreams and
35:08 -  and informations that on this property we were going ourselves to be threatened.
35:14 -  And that somehow the Lord would bring us through it. It's in the wilderness. And it's going to take
35:20 -  wilderness people to bring a wilderness witness. So we're on something
35:26 -  critical. Wim? I mentioned what happened in San Antonio when we went to have a hamburger. And that lady came to you.
35:32 -  You want to share that? I want to share it because I guess it was certainly a confirmation to me
35:38 -  that we were having that after a meeting we went to have a hamburger. I guess it was the last night we were there.
35:44 -  And a lady came saw Art there and said I need to talk to you. And she came up and
35:50 -  sat down and just started talking about this vision the Lord had given her about hiding Jews and
35:56 -  all these things. And they had begun to change their lifestyle and do everything in obedience to what
36:02 -  she said. And my man she said my husband doesn't understand me. He thinks I freaked out. She had a face shining
36:08 -  like an angel. What a precious believer. The fact of the matter is I should have left the day before. The only reason
36:14 -  I was there an extra day is because my car broke down. First time ever that something had gone fluky in my dashboard
36:20 -  where my instruments were going wild all over the place. And I thought I was overheating and it wasn't overheating at all. I had to
36:26 -  stay over an additional day. And because of that we had a wonderful time with the leadership of Wim's Fellowship
36:32 -  on community I believe. And then we went in for a hamburger and here's this woman Art Katz. I can't
36:38 -  believe it. I've been wanting to see you. My husband thinks I'm mad. I don't know what to think. I have to tell you
36:44 -  I think that God is wanting us to move. He's told me that we have to build a 20 foot table
36:50 -  and we've got to do this and that. I lost some large property and the number 40 keeps coming up. The number 40.
36:56 -  She said Art am I mad? I said you dear sister. You need to know you're right
37:02 -  on with God. And he has appointed you to spur something that will be
37:08 -  life and death for Jews in a soon coming hour. And she said I don't understand this number 40. I said well
37:14 -  it may mean 40 miles or 40 acres or some kind of responsibility to move them through a certain portion of
37:20 -  it. We got back to Wins House that night and that mail that had come that day was a real estate sale
37:26 -  with 40 square miles of property for sale on the Texas Mexican
37:32 -  border. I have experiences like this every time I go out now.
37:38 -  I told you I went to a Holocaust conference in Seattle at the University of Washington and I gave the brothers
37:44 -  who knew I was coming leave to arrange meetings for me. I said here's how God confirms this.
37:50 -  I saw the announcement of this Holocaust conference a scholars conference. I said wow the 21st and 22nd annual
37:56 -  and I hastily sent in my registration. The day that I sent the registration I got a phone call
38:02 -  from Alaska. A woman saying Art when are you going to come up to us? You've been promising. I said well
38:08 -  I'll never be closer than when I'm going to be in March. Where are you going to be? I'm going to be in Seattle. Oh she said
38:14 -  can you come up to Juneau? We'll fly you from Seattle and back. I said well you have to know I have only two free days Thursday and Friday.
38:20 -  She said those are the days of our Bible school. Up I went and in fact I came so crunched
38:26 -  from the Holocaust conference to see men merchandising in the bones of the victims
38:32 -  and I had my own paper that I had prepared on the subject. I was not a speaker. And I thought I'll use the first morning
38:38 -  maybe just even to review a few things but there are only 12 people there. They won't be interested. And
38:44 -  I did it and I thought how dull. I don't even like the way I'm hearing myself. But when it was over
38:50 -  the leading assemblies of God, Pastor and Juneau said to me Artie said I've been to Masada
38:56 -  and I have subscribed to the conventional explanations about Jewish heroism
39:02 -  but after hearing you today said my whole view has been changed in the light of what you've been saying about judgment.
39:08 -  I said my dear brother you'll find that from this day forth not only has that view been changed
39:14 -  but every view has been changed. Something about the issue of the Holocaust
39:20 -  that touches and alters everything. And so I came back from that Thursday and Friday expecting meetings to have been arranged
39:28 -  for me for that weekend in Tacoma or Seattle where I've been several times over the years and been in many churches
39:34 -  not a single door had opened. And the guys who had been trying to arrange said Artie we don't know what it is
39:40 -  we've tried we've called nobody will have you. I said well that's strange. He said except that a woman
39:46 -  called, same one who called last night before the meeting to say she was praying and interceding for us
39:54 -  to whom you had given our phone number just before I left on the trip she had written me a letter thanking me for
40:00 -  German addresses I had given her. She had a wonderful time in Germany. And I noticed that the post mark was Washington, state of Washington
40:06 -  but it's some little town, Little Rock, Washington. And I wrote to her a letter quickly I said I'm going to be in Seattle why don't you
40:12 -  call these guys for arranging my meetings if you're close enough to come. She called and found out there were no meetings at all.
40:18 -  So she said you think Artie would come to us? We're way out on the boondocks.
40:24 -  We're south of Tacoma and just in off the coast and just a little handful of saints and
40:30 -  they said well there's no other meetings. And they told me about it I said go ahead set it up. And so I drove down
40:36 -  there when I came back there were no other meetings learning that the pastor of that little fellowship was in ministry
40:42 -  because of the blessing he had received from my ministry at a retreat center in California
40:48 -  many years before and now I'm coming to his fellowship. And so I arrived and they take me out to see
40:54 -  an 80 acre property that they're about to obtain in which they thought that they were going to build a minister's retreat for tired
41:00 -  ministers. I didn't say a word I'm looking over that property. Everything is going off in me.
41:06 -  All kinds of signals and I shut my I don't say anything. I let them think it's going to be a minister's retreat
41:12 -  center. And we came back that night we had a home meeting wall to wall saints and I
41:18 -  shared with them from Ezekiel 20 God's last days stratagem for
41:26 -  the saving of a remnant from his people while at the same time a radical test for his
41:32 -  church and also the nations. You could have heard the proverbial pin drop. There was such an anointing
41:38 -  such an authority. It wasn't a man giving an opinion. It was a thus saith the Lord. A mandate had come
41:44 -  to a people in a wilderness place completely by surprise in a moment. It was a
41:50 -  night to be remembered. And when it was over some people came up for prayer they said when you pray with us
41:56 -  we're in the fishing business and we had thought to sell our fleet. Oh I said well where do you harper it?
42:02 -  Anchor it. Anchor it. A dry docket. Oh they said
42:08 -  in Alaska by the what do they call those Siberian Straits the right?
42:14 -  Bearing Straits. By the Bearing Straits. The moment they said that my spirit
42:20 -  leaped and I said I said let's pray. And when we finished praying
42:26 -  the brother said well maybe instead of thinking about selling our fleet we need to think of updating it.
42:32 -  I said dear brother I think that's good. You're going to find that you're not going to be moving fish but men.
42:38 -  I can multiply these story saints. And that place that I'm describing is directly
42:44 -  lateral to the place of the picture that I have in Oregon just south of it with the same proximity
42:50 -  to the coast. That Jews could be brought out of Russia out of Siberia down the west coast of America.
42:56 -  And built by the Salmon River. And I know places like that on both coasts
43:02 -  right down like a funnel into Mexico and out through a seaport that God has already
43:08 -  appointed. Which is the same seaport under a different name by which the conquistadors came into
43:14 -  America back in the 16th century with many Jews among them who were burned at the stake even
43:20 -  in what is today Mexico. One last story and I can multiply them
43:26 -  but just to show you that this is global. Being in Switzerland
43:32 -  my book Reality came out in French and brought a little response and I started a
43:38 -  correspondence with some young couple that wrote to me. They loved the book and finally I visited with them and we
43:44 -  established a relationship and I would visit them from time to time. On this visit they wanted me to see
43:50 -  a property that they thought God wanted them to purchase. Multi-million dollar estate. It was a posh
43:56 -  girl school that had once been a Moravian place of refuge. Three centuries before
44:02 -  Moravians in flight from persecution had used that place as a place of refuge.
44:08 -  It had been a nobleman's estate and had become in modern times a posh girl school.
44:14 -  It had everything. Barracks, homes, garage, barns, vineyards, gardens,
44:20 -  everything. And it was being sold for millions of dollars and I thought God wanted them to have it though. They didn't have that kind of money.
44:26 -  We were walking over the place because often God will speak to you on a property as he did on that property.
44:32 -  And as we were walking I said, you know, wouldn't it be remarkable that a place that had its inception
44:38 -  as a flight from persecution, a place of refuge from Moravians would end
44:44 -  as a place of refuge for Jews. And the moment that word came out of my mouth the Holy Ghost fell.
44:50 -  I mean fell in such a way that not one of us dared take a step or even breathe.
44:56 -  Like, Lord, what are you saying? And we just took hands in a circle and asked him that question, what are you
45:02 -  saying Lord? I never imagined Switzerland although I should have, what place would be exempt if it's through the
45:08 -  nations of the peoples? And they said, you've got to go in and tell the director because they're liable to sell this
45:14 -  property and to someone who has no vision for this purpose. I said, well, I'm an American, you know,
45:20 -  these French speaking people will look at us with contempt as some weirdo talking about flight and refuge.
45:26 -  They said, oh, you've got to. I said, okay. We walk into the director's office and on his desk
45:32 -  in French, one on top of the other, reality of Ben Israel. He had just finished
45:38 -  finished reading both books with his wife and in walks the author and he was blessed by both books
45:44 -  and I told him what I'm telling you and he took it absolutely seriously. It wasn't some weirdo.
45:50 -  It was a man whose reputation and character had been established through his books. He said, let me get on the phone
45:56 -  and call the pastor who is responsible for the committee for the sale of the property. He called this man
46:02 -  long distance, introduced me over the phone. You couldn't have bought that. And the man says, well, we need to speak
46:08 -  about this face to face. I said, I agree. I said, when can we do this? Well, he said, I'm going to be in Basel next Monday. I said, you are?
46:14 -  My schedule has just been changed. I'm going to be in Basel on Monday. And we met on Monday in Basel and I
46:20 -  spoke to him for two hours. God's last days dealings with Israel. Flight through the nations. And here's what I said to
46:26 -  him. Your decision about this property is a decision for the destiny
46:32 -  of your movement. Your Moravian movement has become a curio, something like the Mennonites
46:38 -  of the present time, or the Amish who drive horse carts and don't wear buttons.
46:44 -  It's a cute cultural phenomenon, but it's not the radical Anabaptist power that
46:50 -  it was in its inception. It has settled into something much less. Your decision about this property
46:56 -  will affect the destiny of your movement. Either you go out like a little bleep and you're fast becoming that, or God will
47:02 -  revive you or bring you into the apostolic splendor and power that you knew at the first, because you'll bless them
47:08 -  that blessed thee. Pray for that property. It's still up for grabs. It's been
47:14 -  temporarily rented by a German group that is fixing it up. God bless the Germans. But it's not yet sold.
47:20 -  So I can tell you story after story. And not an exaggeration, not a word of exaggeration
47:26 -  of anything I'm telling you. Only to impress you with this. This is not some phantasmal thing.
47:32 -  It's not an allegory. It's not a metaphor. There is going to be a time of flight
47:38 -  where the Jews will be cast out of Israel and into the nations again. I can't say assuredly, though it's my strong
47:46 -  anticipation, but surely the Jews that are in the nations will not remain in the places of safety and affluence
47:52 -  that they now know and enjoy. With a fury poured out, he will meet with them because he must
47:58 -  rule over them or he'll rule over none. And the key for us is I will meet
48:04 -  with you face to face. And the little episode that took place here at Ben Israel,
48:10 -  but I always insert, of how much of a demand that's going to be. You know, mere religious
48:16 -  condescension is not enough. Merely for them to see people who are pursing their lips and grimly
48:22 -  accommodating them is not going to reveal God. We had a Jewish hitchhiker picked up
48:28 -  in the first Ben Israel. And a skid row nothing with rags on his back. Someone picked
48:34 -  him up and he thought, Ben Israel, they're Jewish, I'll bring him to them. And Paul Volk
48:40 -  received him. Can you find a nicer Jewish brother? Mild mannered, sweet spoken,
48:46 -  not this Art Katz type. And he showed him a place to stay and he got him some
48:52 -  food. And before he could turn around and leave, this guy was complaining. He didn't like the facility,
48:58 -  didn't like the food, he didn't like this, he didn't like that. And Paul said when he heard the lack of gratitude
49:04 -  and the criticism, the ingratitude, he said something rose up in his gut that he had never
49:10 -  before experienced. He said, it was murder. That's one Jew with another Jew.
49:16 -  What about Gentiles when they're going to catch, when Jews are going to come in their surly manner? You think that
49:22 -  they're going to be full of gracious compliment and thank you and and on their best behavior, they're going to be
49:28 -  they're going to be deranged. They're going to be knocked out of their nest. They're going to be completely bewildered.
49:34 -  I can still remember the films that I used to show my history classes of the Warsaw ghetto, a Jewish
49:40 -  woman holding her dead baby walking back and forth like a caged tiger on the sidewalk
49:46 -  and off into the gutter, back on the sidewalk and down into the gutter with her hair screaming, with one stocking up, one stocking down,
49:52 -  and completely out of her mind. Because of the sudden shock of what had happened to her.
49:58 -  Jews who were affluent and all of a sudden stripped facing the grimest details and
50:04 -  their children dying in their arms for starvation or disease. There were women who came to Auschwitz
50:10 -  and when the train stopped, they got up to the mirrors and put on their lipstick and combed their hair
50:16 -  thinking they were coming to some kind of rest center. Only to find within hours they were in an oven.
50:22 -  With a fury poured out means calamity and it means suddenness.
50:28 -  And those sophisticated kids who have it all together, when conditions
50:34 -  are accommodating will find that when the bottom falls out, they're not going to be all that gracious. They're not going to know what hit
50:40 -  them. And in that condition, they're going to come upon us. Will we be prepared to receive the assault?
50:46 -  The weight of that, physically, morally, emotionally, and spiritually.
50:52 -  At a time when we'll be risking our own lives to receive them. I know you're saying it can't happen here.
50:58 -  Conditions can never like that happen in America. Oh, you silly saps. If it could happen in Germany, in the
51:04 -  land of Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Brahms, Beethoven and Mozart, you don't think
51:10 -  it can happen here in Dinkyville with a culture that's paper thin and under the surface of it, the most vile hatreds and
51:16 -  bitternesses and racial antagonisms. It'll erupt like that. And the skinheads are already in motion
51:22 -  and the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klans that will rise to the surface to be a dominant class in society.
51:28 -  So we'll be doing it at risk. And in that condition, and they despise our facilities
51:34 -  and don't like what we've prepared, what will rise up out of your gut? Involuntarily.
51:40 -  What, no fury like a woman scorned? No.
51:46 -  No hell. No, yeah. And what rises up when
51:52 -  hospitality is scorned when it comes at great cost? That's why God is speaking now.
51:58 -  What's the ministry of Elijah? Turning the people and preparing the people
52:04 -  for the last days realities that precede the coming of the Lord. And there's got to be a spiritual preparation
52:10 -  of a people that will have the moral, spiritual stamina and sanctification that is so thorough
52:16 -  and so deep, no matter how they hit from the blind side, no matter what the human disappointment, no matter what is said,
52:22 -  all that those who are inflicting and testing them by that will find the sweetness
52:28 -  of Christ, the unconditional love of God that cannot be offended against.
52:34 -  When I preached about I said this once before in the course of these weeks, that by our mercy
52:40 -  they will receive mercy, a woman cried out voluntarily in the congregation. But Archie said we don't have mercy for each other. How are we going to
52:46 -  have it for Jews? Exactly. It's because we know that they will come when that mercy will be called
52:52 -  for, we had better start coming into a relationship where we will be extending mercy to each other. And that's the
52:58 -  remarkable mystery of God. That the last days requirement of the church
53:04 -  with regard to the Jew in their utter and final extremity is exactly the kind of
53:10 -  thing that makes church church and fits us for our own eternal destiny to rule and reign with him in the
53:16 -  meekness of the Lamb. So I don't know how we got on this, I wondered when the Lord was going to insert this
53:22 -  but he used the word wilderness to trigger something. A people that will meet him in the wilderness
53:28 -  by seeing his face in a wilderness Elijah people who
53:34 -  cannot be offended against. Oh, 20 years ago when I was praying with my mother, the Lord gave me a picture
53:40 -  with regard to the suffering that he would make
53:46 -  us go through. He said it wasn't everybody but it's to do with the
53:52 -  preparing a rose, the passage in Isaiah that says about knocking down the mountains
53:58 -  and filling in the valley. And the picture was of the knocked down mountains filling in the valley
54:04 -  and an absolutely golden rose going across it. And the Lord said
54:10 -  not everybody's got to experience this but as I do this with you
54:16 -  so you will make a golden rose that others can walk along to find pain.
54:22 -  The highway of holiness, yeah. It's the golden net of the rose which is us
54:28 -  because we've been smashed down and the gold of Jesus
54:34 -  Amen. Let's take a look at the classic text in Isaiah.
54:40 -  We'll conclude with this chapter 35 that begins with the word wilderness.
54:48 -  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them.
54:54 -  Will we be glad for the wilderness and the solitary place? How do you like to be solitary
55:00 -  and not one of the boys? How do you like to be a stink and a reproach?
55:06 -  Isaiah 35.1 Because we have got to occupy that place if that place is to be
55:12 -  for them subsequently and glad for them. We need first to be glad for it.
55:18 -  Will we give up our 17 room house and whatever the equivalent is to be brought into the wilderness place
55:24 -  and be glad for it and count the privilege and distinction. I keep telling the Lord
55:30 -  Lord I'm the most privileged man. I'm so privileged. You have reserved me for your best.
55:36 -  I thank you that you've saved me from being a Jewish Billy Graham. That you didn't make me some charismatic personality
55:42 -  that flit from holiday in to holiday in. I thank you you've brought me to your finest and your best in different places in the world.
55:48 -  You answered my prayer I said reserve me Lord for your truest use.
55:54 -  And it took a solitary place. A wilderness place.
56:00 -  And the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. That country that I passed through in Mexico
56:06 -  no water, blazing heat. The Lord will be their cover. Fountains will break forth
56:12 -  in the wilderness. I'm not being poetic I'm being literal. They're going to see God in supernatural power
56:18 -  as they have not understood nor seen Him since they came out of Egypt. And they'll say
56:24 -  no longer will you say that I'm the God who brought you out of Egypt. But you'll say that I'm the God who has brought you
56:30 -  out of the nations and in every place where you were cast. With exactly the same supernatural demonstration
56:36 -  as your fathers knew at the first. It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy
56:42 -  and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it. The excellency of Carmel and Sharon. That's not to say that it
56:48 -  takes place there. But the excellency of those places will be found in the solitary place.
56:54 -  It'll be something golden. The Lord will do something ravishing. They shall see the glory of the Lord
57:02 -  and the excellency of our God. Not only in what He does supernaturally to sustain them in such places
57:08 -  but by their making contact with His remnant people who reveal His glory.
57:14 -  The light that lightens the Gentiles is the glory of the people of Israel. I'm saved because
57:20 -  of that. I'm saved because a young high school girl on vacation in Switzerland was willing
57:26 -  to spend the day with me when I was bumming around as the hopeless atheist and bumped into this little
57:32 -  innocent whose friends had left her for the day and walking the woods surrounding Zurich and probing this girl's motive
57:38 -  who kept talking about the love of God, the love of God, the love of God. And finally reaching such a point of disgust to say, hey, I can't
57:44 -  stay in this God talk anymore. I'm sick of cliches, whether they're Marxist or Christian. Answer me one
57:50 -  question that no Christian has ever been able to answer in all of the times that I have been involved
57:56 -  in encounters with Christians and have done them in. You've been talking about God? How do you know that He is?
58:02 -  I thought to myself, I got her now. That's silent since you'll think of some clever thing from Sunday school and I'll run
58:08 -  roughshod over like a steam roller. No hesitation tilted up a little face to me beaming
58:14 -  with the light of God. Oh, Archie said, I know that God lives, He lives in me. And boom,
58:20 -  down I went, the struck ox, the blow, the power, finally
58:26 -  groggily, so to speak, getting to my feet, and what hit me? The power
58:32 -  of that statement. And it wasn't even intellectual. It wasn't even theological. In fact, it sounds
58:38 -  like a cliché. I know that God lives, He lives in me. You know what the power was? She had the face
58:44 -  to prove it. Little wasp, white Anglo-Saxon middle class
58:50 -  Protestant from the American Midwest. What a formula that every New York
58:56 -  Jew would shrink from in any way even acknowledging. The epitome that
59:02 -  the summing up of all that we despise and have contempt for was represented in that girl.
59:08 -  But there was a light in her face. It's the light that lightens the Gentiles and the glory of the people
59:14 -  of Israel. But I saw that light, Berkeley graduate, ex-Marxist intellectual world traveler.
59:20 -  I was jealous. Little high school Gentile. Jealous for the light that I had never found
59:26 -  in any Marxist institute or university. They're going to see something in our faces, saints.
59:32 -  That's the glory of God. And we're going to say something
59:38 -  to them. Strengthen you the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees. This is now God speaking to us.
59:44 -  They shall see, but now we're being addressed in verses three and four. Say to them that are of a fearful heart,
59:50 -  be strong, fear not. Here's your answer to whether the church is going to be here in the last day's tribulation time.
59:56 -  Who's speaking to them? Who can say to them, fear not? That could be more than
01:00:02 -  just a little bleep. More than just a hopeful statement. But that when they hear the fear not,
01:00:08 -  their fear goes. Something goes. It's a word that's creative. It establishes
01:00:14 -  fearlessness. It establishes hope. It's a life giving word. It's a creative event for those
01:00:20 -  who hear it. Don't tell me we're going to be able to speak a word like that if we ourselves are afraid.
01:00:26 -  Afraid of our reputations and afraid of loss of recognition or security or
01:00:32 -  whatever. This is a prepared people who can strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
01:00:38 -  by speaking. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, be strong, fear not.
01:00:44 -  Behold your God will come. Imagine the confidence that we have. We have such a grasp of the eschatological
01:00:50 -  conclusion of the age. All the more confirmed by what's happening with them. They are assigned to the nations.
01:00:56 -  It's ticking away. It's happening. Yeah, Art spoke of it in 1992 when
01:01:02 -  we had our prophetical school, but I don't know. It sounded far fetched and imaginary, but here it is.
01:01:08 -  1996 or 8 or whatever, and it's happening. And when it
01:01:14 -  happens, saints, it will come suddenly. And the preparation therefore needs to begin for it now. Your God will come
01:01:22 -  with vengeance. The day of the Lord. Even God with a recompense, He will come
01:01:28 -  and save you. The deliverer will come out of Zion. And save them from their sins
01:01:34 -  and Jacob from their transgressions. Because it is written, I have a covenant with them.
01:01:40 -  Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened. What a word that is. What was the messianic task?
01:01:46 -  To preach the good tidings, the good news to the meek, to hear the broken
01:01:52 -  hearted, to give sight to the blind, to open the prison doors and to set the captives free. Then the eyes of the blind shall be
01:01:58 -  opened. This is preaching. This is a word. It's not a saying like a little vocalization.
01:02:04 -  It's a prophetic word. That breaks the power of fear. That establishes
01:02:10 -  faith. That gives hope. That saves them. If you're hopelessness, you're a candidate for death. It's the hopeless
01:02:16 -  who die in the concentration camps. It's those who have some kind of hope that survive under the very same conditions.
01:02:22 -  A word that comes to them. And the eyes of the blind shall be opened. What an event. By saying a
01:02:28 -  word. And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a heart and the tongue of the dumb
01:02:34 -  sing. For in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert. And the part's ground shall
01:02:40 -  become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grassed with greets and rushes.
01:02:46 -  I think there'll be little water breaking out. God will give us people to drink. He'll keep them from the heat of the sun.
01:02:52 -  But it'll also be waters of life when we say unto them. And a highway shall be there.
01:02:58 -  And the way, and it shall be called the way of holiness. In the most remote, dusty, back
01:03:04 -  wood parts of the world that hardly be found on a map. That when I tell people Bemidji, they said
01:03:10 -  my travel agent can't find it. The unclean shall not pass over but shall be for those the wayfaring men though
01:03:16 -  fool shall not err therein. No lion shall be. You don't have to worry about the Nazis there. You don't have to worry about your anti-Semitic
01:03:22 -  persecutors there. Nor any ravenous beast who wants to do you in. It shall not be found there
01:03:28 -  but the redeemed shall walk there. And the ransomed or the redeemed of the Lord shall return
01:03:34 -  and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness
01:03:40 -  and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. That's why my heart was broken with David the other night.
01:03:46 -  Broken not because he was interfering with our meeting or striking a wrong note. He was
01:03:52 -  broken because he has no anticipation of this. Because I know what's coming in my prophetic heart
01:03:58 -  and he wants so much to see it not come. Can't Israel be established already? Haven't they suffered enough?
01:04:04 -  But what is the sorrowing and the sighing that shall flee away? The Holocaust did not produce it.
01:04:10 -  Not the depth of sorrow and sighing but when the last hope has been demolished, when we have been uprooted
01:04:16 -  out of the places where we thought we would finally be safe, the United States of America Switzerland, the Western democracies
01:04:22 -  and there we're hounded and persecuted. There the skinheads and the Nazis
01:04:28 -  have so taken over and influenced society that there's not a place of safety. And what shall we hope then?
01:04:34 -  Our ideals and our democratic ideologies and all that has proved nothing. That's where I came to
01:04:40 -  38 years ago. Those hopes died that maybe a candidate for God.
01:04:46 -  And where it says the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing
01:04:52 -  implies they may have been there before but they were not there as the redeemed of the Lord. Something of so
01:04:58 -  radical a kind was required that may have necessitated their expulsion again
01:05:04 -  into the nations thinking this would never again happen. That the hope of having our own nation
01:05:10 -  and safety that we have so long sought that that too fails
01:05:16 -  what a mourning and sighing. That is the root cause of it. The final
01:05:22 -  and ultimate disappointment and cast again into the nations how far will God go
01:05:28 -  to have a people prepared for their millennial destiny. That sorrow
01:05:34 -  and sighing shall flee away and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. Here's the eternality
01:05:40 -  of it. This is a final historic episode but it brings us into the millennial
01:05:46 -  and eternal age. Everlasting joy. Here's where God wipes away the tears.
01:05:52 -  Here they shall not weep anymore. Here he says you can lie down in peace and safety
01:05:58 -  and not be afraid anymore. But this is what false prophets
01:06:04 -  are already saying has come. That you can be safe. This will not come upon you.
01:06:10 -  You've suffered enough. There'll be no further catastrophes. How the ears love to hear.
01:06:16 -  The soothing thing. But the prophet who says brace yourself. There's something yet to come.
01:06:22 -  Devastation. A time of Jacob's trouble. A possible expulsion again into the nations. Whether or not
01:06:28 -  that something so severe that will and must bring you to a place where you say we are cut off.
01:06:34 -  We are without hope. We are as dry bones. Then comes your life from the dead. So the redeemed of the Lord
01:06:40 -  shall return. There may not be many. Because in Ezekiel 20 if we had gone on it says and the rebels that are among you
01:06:46 -  who have transgressed against me I will purge out. I will take them out of the nations wherein they have sojourned.
01:06:52 -  But I will not bring them into the land. And I tell you saints brace yourself. It's only a remnant that are going to survive
01:06:58 -  this process. I think the great majority of our Jewish people unhappily are rebels who transgress.
01:07:04 -  And only a remnant who will respond to the grace and the mercy available to them in the hour of
01:07:10 -  extremity will constitute the redeemed of the Lord that shall return. And with their return is his return.
01:07:16 -  For he is pent up in the heavens waiting the restoration of all things spoken by Isaiah, spoken by
01:07:22 -  Ezekiel, spoken by Hosea. What did they speak? That Israel will return. A nation
01:07:32 -  will be restored. May not be many numerically but they will stand for a redeemed nation. And the Lord who is
01:07:38 -  pent up waiting for that can come and occupy his capital in that restored land.
01:07:44 -  This is no longer theoretical. It's no longer fanciful. It's not a text
01:07:50 -  that we can use as a metaphor to refer to the church or to find spiritual allusions
01:07:56 -  for our sermons. This is nit-grit stuff. This is literal. There's going to be
01:08:02 -  a highway of holiness in the wilderness and many will be saved thereon.
01:08:08 -  And we have been robbed of this meaning by the lack of faith to have believed this as a literal word
01:08:14 -  that such an extravagant design could have taken place in the last days. God casting his ancient people again
01:08:20 -  out into the nations and sifting them through it and particularly the wilderness of the nations and there designing
01:08:26 -  an encounter face-to-face that they might by that return as the redeemed of the Lord
01:08:32 -  with everlasting joy upon their heads, mourning and sighing having fled away and joy and
01:08:38 -  singing replacing good. What have we done with that verse? We've sung it in our church services
01:08:44 -  mindlessly and stupidly and so the redeemed of the Lord shall return
01:08:50 -  banging out tamarids and renouncing unto Zion, never once thinking that it meant them.
01:08:56 -  How prepared are we then for the reality that's about to come? Kathy?
01:09:04 -  I was thinking when you talked about the Catholic and that and there's this verse in the Matthew Quintin Course that says pray that your flight not be in the winter
01:09:10 -  and not on the Sabbath and I've got one gal, she's in Washington now, but the Lord gave her a vision of Alaska
01:09:16 -  of which she didn't know but somebody confirmed it to her that it had been at that exact spot. And the one thing that she mentioned was that
01:09:22 -  they were moving the Jews under the very worst of conditions into the storms and the weather
01:09:28 -  because the search planes couldn't be out and keeping to those Catholics and just like these people now it's been what, at two o'clock in the afternoon
01:09:34 -  but it'll be in the dark at night or some place I mean, can men go to Catholics at night?
01:09:40 -  Well, at your table is a brother who was with me in Alaska, the Yukon British Columbia
01:09:46 -  close to the Arctic Circle and we were ministering and moving with leading ministers at a
01:09:52 -  movement called The Move that have communities from the Arctic Circle to the Amazon but they don't
01:09:58 -  believe the restoration of Israel they don't believe in the physical little return of the Lord but they're darling, sweet
01:10:04 -  heart, precious people who have sacrificed and suffered to establish wilderness
01:10:10 -  communities and how many of them Mike said to us you know, we don't even know really why we're here
01:10:16 -  but we feel that we're here for purposes beyond ourselves that we don't yet understand. A brother from that movement
01:10:22 -  in Massachusetts writes to me and says Artie said, I know that I know that you're a key
01:10:28 -  of God to remove the veil from this entire movement and to show them God's last days purposes
01:10:34 -  for Israel, whom they think they have replaced in their what's that word, triumphalist
01:10:42 -  kind of Christianity they are physically situated they're heroic people
01:10:48 -  and they're all strung out in the long places that are will be places of safety
01:10:54 -  of refuge and flight in the day that the Lord, in the day of his power they will be willing.
01:11:06 -  Isn't this remarkable? Something that some of you may know and may not know
01:11:12 -  in the winter time you don't even need a boat to go over to Russia, you can walk across
01:11:18 -  the Barren Strait. You know how we came into favor with that movement? They had never
01:11:24 -  before ever invited anyone to address it outside of their own ranks. They are a very exclusive
01:11:30 -  sect but the founder of that movement, now dead
01:11:36 -  in fact he died in a plane crash flying to meet me a great apostolic figure who was able
01:11:42 -  somehow to speak a word that that people were able to uproot themselves in their middle class lifestyles, sell their
01:11:48 -  homes, their businesses, then come up to the Yukon and live in tents in the winter that as they ate there, the spoon would
01:11:54 -  stick to the jaw of their mouth if it was so cold and struggle through every kind of they're tremendous people.
01:12:00 -  What brought us in relationship? He heard a tape of a message that I gave in Jerusalem
01:12:06 -  on Elijah where I was not supposed to be a speaker and the Lord had me on a platform
01:12:12 -  and I'm still suffering the reproach for having taken more time than I was supposed to have taken because the note came up to me
01:12:18 -  while I was talking from Jamie Buckingham, my co-author or my publishers on the platform that said, take 45
01:12:24 -  minutes. I said, oh praise God. They must recognize the anointing on this word which the Lord gave me
01:12:30 -  three o'clock that morning and I went into the bathroom to look it over and not to wake Inger up in the motel room.
01:12:36 -  I found out later when I years looked back at that note that it was supposed to take 4-5 minutes
01:12:42 -  and I read it as 45 and to this day suffering the reproach
01:12:48 -  of a man who does his own thing self-willed, independent and leaving Kathryn Kuhlman
01:12:54 -  waiting in the wings and not taking that offering by which they lost over $20,000 and they were not able
01:13:00 -  publicly to acknowledge the great dignitaries of there because this squirt this upstart who was
01:13:06 -  stopped upon arrival in coming to Israel when I presented my passport and was found I was on a blacklist
01:13:12 -  and they wouldn't let me in. I said, okay Lord, I'm ready to go back on the same plane you want me here for some purpose of your own
01:13:18 -  get me through. And they jab it in Hebrew making telephone calls and they let me in.
01:13:24 -  They had invited me to be a speaker at a conference and I had refused it because I was so jealous
01:13:30 -  of the Lord's use of me in that land and did not want to be attached with some kind of touring conference kind
01:13:36 -  of thing that would have made me identified. But when I found out I was on a blacklist there was nothing to hide and sure enough
01:13:42 -  on the last day the Jewish guy they got to replace me got sick. Just like the guy at the Holocaust
01:13:48 -  message had a baby at 4 o'clock in the morning had to fly out of town. And they said the people are complaining that it's not been a
01:13:54 -  single Jewish speaker. Would you share with them 7 minutes? Then it became 15 minutes
01:14:00 -  and then I got the note that became 45. It was a message on Elijah It's the message in the book Reality.
01:14:06 -  It's the message which the brother heard and read and hearing that word about Elijah
01:14:12 -  something was struck in his spirit that opened a door for me into that movement after his death because the
01:14:18 -  last thing he did before he died was everywhere that he went he spoke about art cats this message of Elijah
01:14:24 -  we need to be in relationship with this man there's something in the spirit and realm and when he died I was the
01:14:30 -  first one to be invited and that relationship continues still. And it will be a life and death provision of God
01:14:36 -  for numbers of Jews coming out of Russian God knows where else even from Latin America
01:14:42 -  because of the intricacy of God's working someone said Art if you know all these things why don't you organize it?
01:14:48 -  I said nothing doing this is the hand of the Lord he doesn't need any human assistance
01:14:54 -  we don't have to structure this it's by his spirit we'll find each other by his spirit it's all relational
01:15:00 -  because the people that will pass through this have got to know this is not of man but of God
01:15:06 -  and when they see that they'll return as the redeemed of the world let's pray
01:15:14 -  for this vast thing I'm so pleased somewhere in the early morning hours thinking Lord
01:15:20 -  we passed through the whole subject of this one I never did get a chance to speak about the issue of the wilderness confrontation
01:15:26 -  that you're preparing for your remnant church thank you Lord for answering in your own time
01:15:32 -  can I just add a little something? in Isaiah 62 in this whole main
01:15:38 -  and the burden of the word of the Lord for Jerusalem and that it might be
01:15:44 -  a praise in the earth give him no rest till he establish him till he made Jerusalem a praise in the earth
01:15:50 -  then in 62 then in verse 10 there's some things that might seem to be unclear
01:15:56 -  about this possibly and yet it's the speaking to one people the challenge
01:16:02 -  to them for the benefit of another people to go through
01:16:08 -  go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up
01:16:14 -  cast up the highways or build up the highways gather out the stones
01:16:20 -  I think of the stumbling blocks and the offenses for the people
01:16:26 -  so the word is speaking to one people to go through the gates
01:16:32 -  and in so doing be making the way for another people in terms of wilderness experiences
01:16:38 -  and the dealings and the judgments of God in our life are gates before us for us to enter
01:16:44 -  and for the Lord to do precious, precious I think we can end
01:16:50 -  I'm stirred now by Bob and we can end with it in the very scriptures that Bob cited in Isaiah 62
01:16:56 -  I said watch them upon thy wall O Jerusalem which shall never hold their peace they know not ye that make mention of the Lord
01:17:02 -  keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth
01:17:08 -  do we think that all this is going to take place without intercession do we think that this colossal
01:17:14 -  design of God this last days scenario
01:17:20 -  can take place that these places in the wilderness can be established that a church can be prepared for these encounters
01:17:26 -  that a people can be sifted and kept alive through it and restored to the land
01:17:32 -  it eclipses even the marvel of bringing them out of Egypt can all of that take place with the satanic fury
01:17:38 -  being poured out without the intercession of God's people their watchmen on the wall
01:17:44 -  who will give him no peace day nor night till he establish until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth
01:17:50 -  well I'm just able to sing that and put it on the tape I'd love for Bob to learn it and we would all learn it
01:17:56 -  it goes something like this Isaiah 62 6 and 7
01:18:02 -  I've set watchmen on thy walls Jerusalem which shall never hold
01:18:08 -  their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the Lord
01:18:14 -  keep not silence and give him no rest till he establish
01:18:20 -  until he make Jerusalem a praise
01:18:26 -  in the earth amen till he establish
01:18:32 -  until he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth
01:18:38 -  Jerusalem a praise in the earth
01:18:44 -  let's pray thank you precious God you do all things well
01:18:52 -  Lord we were listless we were tired we shifted in our seats we barely got through the first portion before the break
01:18:58 -  and wondered how we could continue and have you ever been a God
01:19:04 -  to respond to prayer have we ever been the beneficiaries of your life the energy the vitality
01:19:10 -  the anointing the unction the authority the truth that you have been speaking
01:19:16 -  is indisputable it's not a question of fancy it's not the romantic imagination it's very God
01:19:22 -  privileging us with a glimpse of last days reality for which the true church needs now
01:19:28 -  to be prepared it was the very ministry of Elijah not just the talking about him
01:19:34 -  that we have been privileged to experience today and we just want to say we thank you
01:19:40 -  we thank you and we thank the many senators from the nations and those nations are scheduled my God
01:19:46 -  to have their part in this for the very first thing you shall do as the coming king
01:19:52 -  is to judge the nations on one question only and that for all eternity
01:19:58 -  what did you do with the least of these my brethren when you saw them hungry and thirsty and naked for whatsoever you did to the least of these
01:20:04 -  you did also unto me Lord bless your ministers in this room give them a message to take back to their churches
01:20:10 -  to their nations they'll be scorned they'll be looked upon as ridiculous
01:20:16 -  they'll be called romantics and dreamers as your prophets have always been scorned always been rejected
01:20:22 -  but we ask my God a cry and a voice that those who are alive in God will hear
01:20:28 -  or will be made alive in the hearing let the great multitudes reject it because it's contrary to their convenience
01:20:34 -  but let there be a remnant people let there be a remnant people who will hear and respond
01:20:40 -  hear our cry my God as even we prostrate ourselves out over your dead church
01:20:46 -  your ceremonial church going through mock motions and so utterly unprepared for anything of the things that we have discussed
01:20:52 -  and we pray my God for a spirit of intercession that you would hear a cry
01:20:58 -  from us as we prostrate ourselves over that church that would bring it to life
01:21:04 -  again thank you my God grant that we should be men and women
01:21:10 -  of whom it is said the word of God in your mouth is truth
01:21:16 -  whatever it takes Lord and it's going to take a wilderness preparation we invite it this morning
01:21:22 -  in whatever place my God we have found affluence creature comfort security we invite you to rock that boat
01:21:28 -  we invite you to bring wilderness conditions into our lives in an urban place
01:21:34 -  that no one else knows, no one else experiences it takes place behind closed doors and screens and shades that have been pulled down
01:21:40 -  prepare us my God that a camel's hair garment is sufficient, locust is sufficient
01:21:46 -  we don't need the applause of men we don't need acceptance we don't need recognition, only you are grateful
01:21:52 -  saying well done faithful servant and nothing else I bless these children Lord
01:21:58 -  I bless these sons and daughters put something into our souls this morning my God
01:22:04 -  let the word be an event for them something to break forth in the wilderness in the dry place of their own hearts
01:22:10 -  pools breaking forth and streams my God of living water of hope and encouragement and vision and understanding
01:22:16 -  thank you Lord oh gracious God make a way, make straight the way
01:22:22 -  for your coming precious King we pray in Jesus name hallelujah
