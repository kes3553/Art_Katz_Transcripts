Decade of the Nineties 2 of 3

00:00 -  May the Lord play me as well as this brother has played that piano, as crisply and as expertly, to bring forth the desire of his heart. Lord, that's my prayer. Gracious God, the redemption of this speaking occasion and of tonight, my
00:23 -  God, to bring to conclusion what you began so beautifully last night and to leave an enduring deposit with this people and beyond them, my God, through the tapes, to touch the lives of your people and to bring them to a place of
00:41 -  readiness, preparation for the things that shall shortly come to pass. Bless us again, we pray. By your spirit, grant us the sense of your burden, your ache, your concern. Change us by the hearing of your word. Thank you and praise you for our
00:58 -  privilege in it, my God. Now, do you be all praise and glory and honor for it in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, you can have a well-dressed speaker who will be somewhat diminished because he has to wear a jacket or you can have a greater
01:15 -  freedom if you allow me to take it off. Thank you. There's just something incompatible about end time themes and being dressed to the ears because I'm going to paint the picture of struggle and oppression and
01:40 -  persecution and the probability of an eventual martyrdom that somehow is not in keeping with the decorum of Sunday morning services, the strange anomaly of our Christian life, the terrible clash of realities and the choosing of the one
02:01 -  that we intend to be foremost though it contradicts the things that are visible and are seen. How's that for the beginning? Got the point? Have you known that tension? Have you struggled with conflicting realities and do you
02:17 -  realize that ultimately the issue for us is which we will choose? The one that is continually pressing its claims upon us through the media, through the very air we breathe, the whole of society, the whole world is an unspoken conspiracy to
02:33 -  imprint upon us, the remnant people of God, its wisdom, its reality, its claims and many of us have been suckered into saying yea and amen to that not knowing and not understanding how much at odds, how altogether opposed, how contrary in
02:51 -  every point and particular are these conflicting kingdoms. In fact even the issue of their conflict has been somehow eclipsed and obscured. Gary and I were overseas recently and in Switzerland and I went out of my way to see the places
03:11 -  of Anabaptist persecution and suffering. You say who are the Anabaptists? Shame on you for not knowing because you ought to be in conscious unbroken continuum with them whose invisible cloud of witnesses is around us even right now. The true
03:29 -  saints of God and the pattern of church history always reveals it that somehow they're the butt of oppression and persecution by the larger religious majority who cannot abide or tolerate their presence, harmless as they are,
03:45 -  small in number as they are, yet something about them, the quality of their life, what they represent blows the whistle on the fraudulence of conventional Christendom so much so that they cannot permit them to live. We need
04:00 -  to know dear folk that we're here today because of the sacrifice and the bloodshed, the pain, the suffering, the fortitude of generations of saints of that kind who are not yet complete without us. And if that kind of suffering
04:15 -  punctuates the history of the church, what shall its conclusion require? Hallelujah, you're getting serious already. May you never again lapse back to anything less than to what you're now rising to express and to evidence.
04:35 -  Clearly our intention is to ruin you for charismatic things and if you hear me harp on that, it's not because I have some malicious glee, but it stands for kind of a symbol of something that has been acceptable to us and has brought a
04:52 -  measure of delight and improvement to us. It has been an amelioration but something much less than God's own desire for that which is ultimate and pertains to His glory. In fact, just off the top of my head, as the basis of
05:07 -  measure, I would say that the thing charismatic pertains to our interests, how we enjoyed the meeting, how we were blessed, how we are benefited, as the thing apostolic pertains to His glory forever. It's another standard of measure
05:24 -  altogether that is ultimate and requires ultimate consecration to obtain. It is transforming when we no longer have ourselves as the center of our own consideration how well the church is doing and is blessed and its numbers and
05:41 -  its programs and its budgets and have another standard above, beyond, and other than ourselves which remarkably transforms us. So I want to inject you with apostolic and prophetic passion that obliterates every lesser
06:01 -  consideration and by the same token makes you a candidate for persecution, suffering, martyrdom, and death. Not that this is something to be woefully grieved about because the saints that I've described to you counted it as the
06:17 -  crowning witness of their call. If somehow they ended their life in some place less than that, they would search themselves and ask, in what way have we failed to be a people whose faith would of necessity be consummated by the
06:32 -  crown of persecution and martyrdom? So one of two things today, either at the end of the service there'll be a white wagon out there with a strafe jacket awaiting me to cart me away where I really ought to be off and out from the sight of that
06:46 -  which constitutes sanity or we will declare that the things that I'm positing today constitutes ultimate sanity and anything less than that is perversely insane. Having said all that, the Lord has not allowed me any freedom
07:10 -  but to speak one message since the return from this overseas trip which took place at exactly the time when these great communist powers were being toppled and being privileged to have been in and out of East Germany more
07:25 -  times in recent years than Brooklyn, New York, my birthplace and to know Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia and I've been in Romania and some of these places and have sensed how formidable and immovable these monolithic structures
07:41 -  were, I was all the more astonished at how quickly they came down when God snapped his fingers. If we think that we can account for this sociologically or politically we miss it by a mile. In fact too many of us are attenuated to
07:56 -  time and Newsweek magazines and think that that is the perspective by which all things must be seen. God forbid that that's the only basis for interpretation that we have is political and sociological and economic.
08:10 -  Certainly God is in and through those factors but he's the God who broods over history moving it for the consummation that is in his heart and can set up and bring down kings and kingdoms at the snap of his finger. So I just want to
08:27 -  share some impressions they are not prophetic thus saith the Lord's they are rather an assessment of recent events transmuted through a prophetic personality trying to sense their meaning and not all together in agreement
08:42 -  with others who profess the prophetic calling and are also making their forecasts of the decade of the 90s. Have you sensed how I was going to say momentous, portentous, have you sensed the significance of this decade? We're
08:59 -  not just moving into another span of 10 years this is a final and decisive span of time and this I will say without any condescension with an absolute certitude that this final decade will set in the whole configuration of things
09:18 -  as they will be until the very end. If the end does not come by the year 2000 if it takes yet another decade it's all decided. This decade is decisive and especially for the church and its conscious alignment with the purposes of
09:37 -  God and where it indeed will be when the smoke clears at the conclusion of this decade because what I foresee is the emergence of only two essential bodies in Christendom, two radical polarities in opposition to one with the
09:55 -  other. One is called apostate and the other is called apostolic and there's no neutral ground in between. Sorry about that but there's already forces working of a centrifugal kind that will compel us increasingly day by day moment by
10:12 -  moment decision by decision to the one or to the other. The fact that apostolic things seem to us to be radical is not so much what it is in itself as it is the statement of the fact that we have lived so long so below what is normative
10:29 -  in God's intention that when it is expressed to us we we suck for air as if this is some new gospel when all it is is the faith once and for all given the saints which we should have long ago contended for or we would not now need
10:45 -  so strenuously to find it. Can I hear an amen? Bless the Lord. So when these kingdoms toppled ex-Marxist that I am and know something about the power of Marxist ideology and its regimes when these things came down and lost the
11:04 -  respect and the esteem of their own people when the great sovereign head of that whole Marxist world himself introduces political reforms that negates the the ultimate place of the Communist Party in his own nation when
11:20 -  he himself goes to the Pope and and informs him that we have spiritual need and calls him his holiness we need to brace ourselves and to know that we have come to the beginning of the end. These are the end time folks and we ought to
11:38 -  live as if we really believe that even without three suit three-piece suits whatever we do whatever we do tomorrow when we go to business is only a necessary condescension in the world in order to sustain body and life would
11:56 -  have as a place of witness our true calling and our place and our purpose for being a salvation is right here. This is not some Sunday addendum this is the whole purpose for God's creation as I mentioned last night and I think it bears
12:11 -  repeating today from Ephesians 3 10 that God has created all things in order that through the church the manifest or the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated to the principalities and the powers of the air. Now I would be
12:27 -  astonished if you understood what that means. It would be an enormous testimony because well let's say that we'll look for a time and it shall please the Lord to come back because I have been majored in this theme and we all need to major
12:43 -  it to understand that this is the eternal purpose of God for the church and that he did not think it too lavish or too extravagant to create all things because the church cannot exist in some kind of vacuum it's got
12:57 -  to exist in the earth in society in nations there's got to be the ways and means by which of mankind is sustained who thinks that the very issue of its sustenance or its civilization or its culture or its own purposes is what life
13:10 -  is all about but do not know that that's not that's only the secondary thing what it's all about is that God has created all things in order that through the church the ultimate demonstration of the manifold wisdom of God might be
13:26 -  made not only in here in the earth and before visibly before men but to a stratum in the air above the earth where the principalities and powers occupy and somehow that demonstration marks thinnest to the usurping rule and
13:43 -  releases a mankind and bondage for the redemptive reprogram of God for his entire creation of which the church is the key so I can't expect you to understand this in just a single statement but I want want to put this
13:57 -  in your spirits that a church that will not take its eternal purpose into its consideration is not the church if you don't have eternity in your heart if you have not that as the for peace and the sent the most pivot of all you are
14:14 -  seeing who are hopelessly locked into time into culture into the things that temporal and are if so facto by that thing single thing alone rendered invalid for the purposes of God you need to take the eternal purpose of God
14:31 -  into consideration you know the remarkable thing is you say well art that will completely unfit us to be relevant in the world quite the contrary the world says those that are heavenly minded are no earthly good but God says
14:45 -  accept your heavenly minded you know earthly good and that statement from Ephesians 3 10 came I believe from the pen of Paul and he was not some airy and phantasmal apostle who was occupied with futuristic things that made him just a
15:02 -  pitiful spectacle on earth the same man who so embraced and saw the things that were eternal and invisible in such a way that it made his afflictions momentary and light and what afflictions they were is the same man that was nuts and bolts
15:17 -  with the church how to take communion what to do with the table what to do about the issues of judgment in the church how about adultery how about fornication how about this how about long hair how about how about in all of
15:28 -  the practical adumbrations of the faith Paul was the man on the spot and yet the same man totally was absorbed with and taken by the ultimate purposes of God I'll tell you dear children that the church is built on the foundation of the
15:46 -  apostles and the prophets and we have been in a woeful condition for the want of that foundation but I'll tell you that God is restoring men of these foundational callings and it has not been a cheap thing in God's sight it's
16:02 -  an exquisite and painful school of preparation but it's coming now just in time to insert the foundational things that will enable us to stand to overcome to endure and to fulfill both the eternal and immediate purposes of God
16:17 -  for the day of his coming and if I don't say it I don't know what I'm going to be saying I'm just saying word for word and statement by statement as it comes but and excuse me for the ragged interjection of things his coming is not
16:30 -  some fixed chronological event I don't believe like you know we can sit on our haunches and we can burp our way through the next decade and and be the kinds of casual saints that the church has characteristically been and he'll come
16:43 -  and he'll come at a time opportunity to save us from any necessity for suffering what pitiful fictions but I want to say that Peter says what manner of men ought we to be seeing these things looking for and hasting the day of his appearing
17:04 -  isn't it remarkable that the Lord leaves to the church and the issue of its maturation the time of his appearing it's not some fixed kind of chronological thing that's going to happen independent of our condition our
17:17 -  very condition releases him to appear so bless the Lord back to the collapse of Marxist kingdoms the first impression that came to me I know that we're all excited because the doors are now open for evangelism indeed we ought well to
17:36 -  take opportunity by it not knowing what will soon enough come that might close it but I think in terms of what God is wanting to us to understand as we enter this decade of the 90s is that the conditions have now occurred by which a
17:53 -  total global world economic and political system can be established of for which the world will rub its hands in glee because what is its desperate need but unity and peace but it's an antichrist system it's engineered by men
18:12 -  therefore system and it's opposed to God and it seeks by the machinations of men to establish a peace that comes by its enforced rule contrary to the issues of the faith and the freedom for the faith and the word antichrist not only means
18:31 -  against but it means like as appearing to be the same as it's a pseudo ps is it you do pseudo peace pseudo unity that will appeal to many even those who are Christians because there will be a parallel movement to this in the
18:50 -  religious world as in the political for a harmonious political and religious system of a Jezebel and Ahab kind and we're already hearing these things struck particularly in the Catholic charismatic renewal movements that for
19:08 -  the sake of the unified church we need to not allow the doctrines that have divided us you know to continue but you know set them aside the issue is unity unity unity well I don't know what it is about me but I have never been able to
19:23 -  say amen to any of that kind of stuff my guts have always been gnarled and twisted and ache when I have been part by the ordination of God that that is to say I have been in attendance never been part of these ecumenical and
19:40 -  charismatic kinds of things with the banner of the dove and men with turnaround collars and everyone is slapping each other in the back and giving each other hugs as if we have achieved the unity of the faith only the
19:52 -  deceived could conceivably respond to that with any enthusiasm only those who don't know what it what it in fact takes to achieve unity in marriage and in family and in fellowship can it could in any way be impressed with little
20:07 -  suckered in to that fiction it's false and we need to recognize it and know that the world is moving toward it and so as ideology has been removed as a factor that has kept east and west from each other so too will the issue of
20:23 -  doctrine be removed that has kept the great religious bodies from each other and those who will stand for doctrine as Gary and I are already beginning to experience are going to be looked upon as impediments to progress and you're
20:37 -  doctrinally bound and you make issues of doctrine I mean can't you I want to charge you with a jealousy for the word of God for doctrine is not some kind of antiseptic catalog of truths they are the vital issues of the faith and to
20:53 -  sub to allow them to be subverted or to dissipate it is to lose the faith itself which men have died till this hour so I think we're going to see the rise of signs and wonders as a substitute for doctrine taking precedence over doctrine
21:10 -  and that we that we will be expected to be so impressed with what seems to be visible signs of power that isn't that the evidence that God is in this and that we should not make such an issue of doctrines which up from now have
21:22 -  divided Catholicism from Protestantism it's interesting that in the book of Revelation in chapter 6 verse 9 it speaks of those who were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held that's somehow holding the
21:40 -  God in an age that looks upon it as an impediment to ecumenical unity might be the very thing that occasions our death how jealous are you for that word this morning for love the word of God and to contend for it and not to allow it in
21:59 -  any way to be diminished or subverted subverted in the interests of so-called ecumenical unity there will be lying signs and wonders that will eclipse doctrine as a new basis for trans denominational quote unity unquote the
22:16 -  very same base or basis by which anti Christ himself finds acceptance in the nations because he brings fire down from heaven because he's full of supernatural demonstration and who can make war with him so this whole issue of
22:30 -  science wonders seeming demonstrations of power will be the formula for deception for millions of people and I'll tell you what I've never seen a Christendom more candidates for that deception than our present church at
22:43 -  large board looking for something and if they can't find it in some Jewish Lee messianic oriented thing with the the the head coverings of the prayer shawls and the other kinds of Jewish things that seem to bring a resonance of
23:00 -  something into a church that knows that somehow it's wanting something then they'll find it in power or science and wonders so the real antidote to being candidates for that deception is to have what God intends that the church should
23:13 -  have as formative and substantive in its soul and its corporate life and being that doesn't need stick luck stood the Jewish way it doesn't need cutesy stuff of a Jewish kind or the charismatic kind or demonstration of power because the
23:27 -  substance of its life is so preeminently apostolic and prophetic and that's not to negate power but to look again for the power that comes when those that believe are together and great grace is upon them all and with power gave the
23:47 -  Apostles testimony to the resurrection of Jesus Christ that there's a conjunction with true power and true character that is Godly because Apostles if they are anything are holy Apostles and through whom power can be expressed
24:04 -  without fear of usurpation or misuse for the advancing of their own purposes and ambitions there'll be many phony Apostles they already are and prophets already doing their thing and feathering their own nests through our gullible
24:19 -  Christendom that is so easily wants some kind of excitement and novelty of a new kind where the true ones when they come will be painfully jarring unseemly need to be caught away in ambulances as somehow disturbing the serenity of our
24:39 -  meetings may God give us the discernment to distinguish the true from the false and I appreciate the gift of discernment but I think in this case it has something to do with the measure of the maturity of the church as a body if
24:56 -  we're immature if we're carnal if we're fleshly if we're soulish we'll have as much discernment as a fence post so the issue of discernment that saves us from end-time deception is the issue of our maturity the issue of our maturity is
25:11 -  the issue of our consecration and the willingness to hear sharp and demanding things from God and to be changed by them and to break out of that nexus that thinks that a Sunday sermon is only a companion piece to the to the praise and
25:26 -  worship and so long as it's biblical it fulfills its requirement I think that we're going to see from true pastors as the of the kind that you happily have men who will require something from us by the word that is given so we're
25:48 -  moving toward a beast system where the issue of signs and wonders and powers will be a preeminent factor great grace was upon them all you know we have not known that grace in modern times it's something reserved and waiting for us to
26:06 -  become an all it's waiting for us to become an integral body more than the collection of individualities that comprise a Sunday morning congregation it's a people who have come to an allness an integration of life an
26:19 -  intensive occasion a real unity where the word church and community are synonyms one for the other when we will reach that all we will experience a great grace and buy it power great grace component of all and with power
26:37 -  give the Apostles testimony to the resurrection Jesus Christ they did not contain it in themselves but somehow being joined with that body and sent by that body apostolic sending bodies they express the power that was incorporate
26:51 -  in the Saints as the apostolic body and community of God's people we need to break away from this thing of virtuoso men that somehow we look up from our seats with enrapt astonishment that they have it and we're just of course
27:06 -  ordinary few citizens what I mean what have we subscribed to and not understood the organism the genius of what the body of Christ is and that men who are sent from such bodies express the power and the authenticity and the
27:27 -  character of the body itself they are not virtuosos doing their things in a vacuum independent of those by whom they are sent so we need to know that and move consciously toward becoming an apostolic body in its constituency and
27:42 -  maturity and very makeup and character if there are to be sent from us those who will again turn the world upside down that God allows a congregation to lay hands on these men and then says in Acts 13 the first description of
27:57 -  apostolic sending and so after they had fasted and prayed they laid hands on them so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went have you ever doubted on that that God equated the laying on of the hands of men as being synonymous
28:14 -  with the same as being sent forth by the Holy Ghost can we qualify for that this morning we dare submit ourselves to the hands of an entire congregation whom we only vaguely or generally know and who is it among you that was left late last
28:31 -  night twiddling the dial on the TV set or inserting a secret video after your wife went to bed to watch things that are not available conventionally and have those hands laid on our heads we need to know each other folk and attend to one
28:47 -  another not in some kind of snooping sneaky way but to exhort one another daily while it is yet today next on days too late the rhythms of things and what is coming out now in such vile and filth and viciousness in the earth is of such
29:01 -  a potent and supple kind that except that we attend to one another in truth and in love as God intended for the interaction that characterizes true church we're going to be victim of deception and of sin and the falling we
29:17 -  meet one another urgently desperately but not as mere cordial sitters alongside of each other those that believe we're together is more than those that believe were alongside each other together is a profound apostolic word and I want to
29:33 -  tell you this just in brief you'll not get it without suffering you'll not go from casual islands of individualism to an integrated true apostolic sending body that is together without experiencing suffering the suffering of
29:49 -  confrontation the suffering of the humiliation of being found out and as a God waiting for us to come to the ground of truth that he might need us there and bring the redemptive grace that changes us into his image and his sanctifying
30:07 -  instrument is ourselves with each other in the honesty and truth spoken in love that God had always intended as momentous for the church come on guys come out of the world come out of that fiction come out of that nonsense come
30:21 -  out of that privacy come out of that kind of thing that we were taught jealously to safeguard as if somehow it has it has any redemptive value and open ourselves to what our true calling is as the people of God the church who go from
30:35 -  house to house daily breaking bread without calling for us to say you're coming lest you find the guy at whose home you've come with his feet up on the coffee table watching some sleazy thing on the box or his wife's hair up in
30:49 -  curlers or any of the other kinds of things we have got to become the people of God hallelujah it's God's end time provision if the age began in such clash between powers of darkness and light that had its fatalities and casualties
31:06 -  common sense will tell you what should we expect for the when the age ends in the paroxysm of the fury of the powers of darkness who had whose last days are literally numbered and will not let go without bringing down into cataclysmic
31:23 -  destruction all that they can as was expressed through Hitler in the Gothammerung of the last days of the Nazi regime when in the in the midst of a blazing inferno of a destroyed Berlin out of the last bunkers still issuing
31:36 -  commands to destroy to destroy to destroy it's the very nature of the destroyer and we would do well to understand these realities and to be fitted for them well a pastor who heard me once in the Sundays of God pastor
31:58 -  said to the brother who had invited me he said I've never heard a man who hates the world more than this cat and it's a strange paradox because I love the world I love it I love nature I love God's people I love anything that shows the
32:14 -  handiwork of God but there's something instinctive that wells up in me that is so fiercely despising of that which produces and distorts them and ruins it that is confirmed by the script where he says God destroys those who destroyed
32:31 -  the earth so we just need to have a sense I want to just take a few moments to give it an impression of what I think that we can anticipate about social change that is coming in the world even as I've just hinted at the political
32:43 -  economic and religious and already this and it's not nothing that we don't already know it's already working only it's going to come to such volume such intensification and such sweeping power that we should be forewarned because
32:59 -  there's something working in the world a dynamic that is so restless has such a drivenness of its own there are inexorable forces that compel it continually to produce to demand to bring into its orbit mankind in such a
33:16 -  way as to make merchandise even out of their souls there where there's something about human nature that becomes satiated that needs to find ever the increasing novelty new kinds of things for its attraction for its
33:29 -  attention that's why if you look back over television programs that were made a decade or two decades ago and compare them to today there's a remarkable shift I don't know if you've noticed it our present programming is increasingly
33:42 -  violent vile disgustingly sensual words for that it's polluted because people get bored and yet and these men who produce and package such things and we're talking about multi-million but billion dollar things were even
34:01 -  Notre Dame's sells its birthright that is football classics already to a TV network everything is merchandise everything is dollars everything is contract guys who just got out of school get three four five six seven million
34:15 -  dollar contracts to begin with that you say well they were to look what they bring to the box office but what does it bring to us morally what does it do to our whole sense of value and speaking as a depression baby who sucked in the
34:28 -  five-cent bottle of Pepsi Cola with my mother and my brother and counted it privileged for one bottle between us on special occasions when chocolate pudding was considered a treat for a birthday party and I praise God for those hard
34:45 -  times because they gave a sense of value that has been completely lost in the ease and the affluence of a spilling over materialism of this age which when it will be denied when it will abruptly be brought to a halt will occasion such
35:01 -  a screech and howl from a whole generation of pampered people and youth especially that it will be uncontainable so I foresee a rise of violence but of such a cruel and malicious kind as will even shock those who have lost their
35:20 -  capacity to be shocked because there are forces working that produce an increasing impatience in the world where that is encouraged to have and to possess and to gratify itself instantly everything is now and it's immediate
35:36 -  that we have not the patience for anything that is protracted in the earlier TV there were plots there was the unfolding of a storyline there was character development who will sit through a what was that great Civil War
35:50 -  film gone with the wind that takes hours to unfold and you move through a complex plot and character development we want to see it now you watch now what what is being shown 15 second episodes this happens that happens a strong a
36:07 -  confrontation look a gesture of violence a rape and then the next scene that until it comes to a final conclusion it is predicated and inculcates impatience a gratification that is shaped to want now and what happens if that will be denied
36:27 -  in the increasing crescendo of of demand that is legitimated of luxury that is made necessary and it is not gratified we're going to see a short few people explode in anger expressed in violence that will be global that the whole that
36:47 -  the world will teeter-totter in a threatening of a anarchy that will require such an imposition of force that will lay the foundation for a totalitarian global world order where will the church be in such a context is what we need
37:08 -  ourselves to consider an impatient vacuous inherently lawless culturally illiterate sensual world frustrated and exasperated in its contention for it cannot materially obtain will give increasing vent to explosive anger and
37:26 -  physical violence competition for space competition for jobs competition for air competition for water and would just be the formula for explosive calamities and occasion by disaster disasters that will see on each time looting pillage rape and
37:45 -  disorder the new barbarians Chuck Colson Colston not that they are illiterate but they are non literate that words no longer have value or meaning or the patience even to read what to consider because everything is now visual and
38:00 -  prepared for us and we lose even our capacity to enjoy words for themselves one of the most distinguishing features of our humanity is being blurred and is being removed a whole generation of kids trained up sufficient to read manuals or
38:19 -  write an application for work but taking no enjoyment in the printed word which has every capacity for the development of intelligence and refinement and value but amusement has become the motif and the centerpiece of our age everything is
38:38 -  amusement I just think is so many early morning hours isn't there a new slogan for coca-cola about how good it feels everything is couched in sensual terms in gratification and enjoyment amusement well we need to realize that the prefix
38:56 -  a negates the word that follows a theist theist is God Godless or a fear I'm not God believing news means to reflect and to consider to ponder and to wave the very distinguishing characteristic of a moral mankind and when we become satiated
39:15 -  with our amusement we lose our capacity to muse to reflect to ponder and to consider we lose our humanity we become the new barbarians we become the vandals in fact vandalism is the single greatest debacle on university campuses
39:32 -  I think the next is rape and at the university which is supposed to be the citadel of civilization is characterized by vandalism there's little that could be hoped for in the world outside of it what is but now lewd vulgar and obscene
39:52 -  will become enshrined as desirable values and be celebrated as good we are at the verge of such a massive value shift of the script which the scripture foresees that good will be called evil and evil will be called good light will
40:08 -  be called darkness and darkness like that there's a whole value reversal taking place already even in the language of our teenagers when something is good they say it's dead these are not accidental phenomena they are symptoms
40:22 -  of changes already taking place for example the Ten Commandments produces complexes because it says thou shalt not and if only that evil will remove and people could be living in greater harmony with their own natural desires
40:39 -  we would not have people with complexes and and broken down in their minds and in conflict with guilt so the evil is not their fornication the evil is the thou shalt not which is some anarchic system of values that has no credibility and
40:54 -  should long ago have been dismissed and what about those who continue to uphold it and the interesting thing is that it says in the book of Revelation that what distinguishes God's overcoming people is that they have the testimony of Jesus
41:07 -  and they hold the commandments of God the hypodermic needles to the drug addicts so as to keep the danger of AIDS to a minimum Gary while I was in Switzerland Gary was not with me at that time they took me
41:25 -  into Needle Park right opposite the great Swiss reformed church with the statue of Slingley the reformer there and in the shadow of that building and in that part completely given over to the drug addicts beautiful kids from
41:40 -  comfortable middle-class homes with blood running down their arms and legs and the whole thing given unabandonedly to addiction and so the city itself providing up to 7,000 free needles a night so that they should not
41:56 -  contaminate themselves with AIDS with a free AIDS testing station and of course already in our society even prophylactics being freely given at junior high school and high school levels you say but our you know logic requires that
42:10 -  society protect itself from these plagues by at least providing the free needles that may be true at their level but what we need to understand is that when society does this it gives an endorsement it condones the very evil
42:27 -  itself by providing the thing for its performance and erode something in the moral fabric of that society which ironically because of the vacuum caused by it moves more and more people to the actual evil that they think they're
42:43 -  going to restrict society has its back to the wall folks it's come to an ultimate paradox that in the things that they employ for their own defense they deepen their own hole and the only real salvation as it ever and always was was
42:59 -  a salvation in Christ Jesus which is not to be a mere Sunday message but it's the salvation now for nations that the church is required to come forward in such a preeminence and take such a place because the world is freaking out and
43:15 -  its logic and its humanisms cannot save it well there's so much more here but just to say this a great greater number of Christians will not be able to be satisfied with conventional Christendom that merely to sit in a church that
43:35 -  speaks a correct word or doctrine is not enough the things that are merely correct are not enough merely to be phraseologically correct is not enough it needs to be an awesome power and authenticity in our words and in our
43:52 -  life and there's going to be a restiveness and among many Christians who've been able to be satisfied this long in situations like that but the very issues that are taking place in the world will be a factor that will move
44:05 -  saints to look for a deeper quality of faith and relationship and what they now know in their conventional and predictable Christian situations and so we have the very formative factors by which a minority of the spirit will
44:20 -  increasingly be called out to be the remnant people of God who are willing to pay the price of true relationship and true faith whereas the majority who have who do not see the need or have not the stomach for the cost and the sacrifice
44:36 -  of it and who remain in these normative Christian situations will become increasingly deceived having the words that are appropriate to the faith but without the power thereof but what's more they will be irritated by that
44:51 -  minority of the spirit who have moved on to a more authentic existential quality of faith and look upon them not only as being strange but perhaps even being heretical and even threatening to what is considered normal or normative and
45:06 -  Christian in a word we're going to see form the very elements that make up a church that is persecuted and a church that is its persecutor and we need to know now that we're moving for the one or the other it will not be as I've said
45:22 -  before a neutral ground that the logic of true faith is persecution and that the scriptures will be fulfilled that says and they will kill us and claim they are doing God a service we're going to see the reenactment of the persecution
45:38 -  of the Anabaptists in the 16th century even persecuted by the major Reformation churches again to be the distinguishing character of the struggle at the end of the age again apostasy on the one hand or apostolicity on the other
45:58 -  and there'll be no in between and it's not going to be a final moments decision that will determine in which of these two camps who will find ourselves those decisions are being made now every day moment by moment in the things to which
46:11 -  we submit ourselves even our hearing of words like this in our response to them even our willingness to inform God to have it registered clearly with him the witnesses on the earth and in the powers of the air that we determined to be
46:28 -  this remnant pilgrim people these strangers and sojourners in the earth who invite persecution by the very quality of their life as I'm fond of telling in these days that one of my early experiences as a believer where in many
46:45 -  ways I had a quality of faith and commitment then in my naivety that's been hard to retain as I've gone on over the years but sitting in a teacher's cafeteria at the lunch table with a Jewish colleague who was seeing the
46:59 -  psychiatrist and taking pills and having an affair with another teacher and whom to whom I had witnessed earlier but this time at the lunch table just silently eating and yet I could feel billowing out from her such an anger such a
47:12 -  bitterness that you could feel it like like daggers dotting out of the ice and I looked up at sure enough this woman was just about to explode she was virtually foaming at the mouth and finally she threw her fork down as she
47:22 -  stood with exasperation even when you're silent she said you're a living accusation I've never forgotten that and I believe that that shall be a description of God's remnant people at the end of the age we shall not be able
47:39 -  to participate in the things that they think normal normal and our very inability and unwillingness condemns us at their site because it condemns them something about us and I believe that we can expect an increasing radiance from
47:55 -  God that will be visible in our faces no accident that when we went to Johannesburg South Africa before going up to Zimbabwe for a memorial service for the 16 precious white saints had cocked to death two years before by a
48:11 -  band show a band of marauders of a Marxist and racist kind that we were in the home of a Jewish doctor not saved but his wife is a Christian and is related to that family that died and he was telling me that his buddy was among
48:26 -  them whom he knew before he was saved and they were drinking buddies and one of the boys and in fact this buddy of his had been in the war in Zimbabwe and he could kill a black as quickly as looking at one but after he was saved he
48:41 -  was really saved he was converted and went with a band of souls to one of the more remote sections of Zimbabwe and they built a wire far out of the reach of government protection in the very area of a tribe that was in hostile opposition
48:53 -  for the tribe now in power knowing that they were vulnerable by that very decision led by God to be a community of reconciliation in that location and sure enough though they chose not to arm themselves trusting God for their
49:06 -  defense abruptly in one late night our came this marauding band and tied them their hands behind their backs with barbed wire and led them into a building and hacked them to death there was not a shot sounded just the sound of the axe
49:19 -  thumping into bodies the black brother who was witness to it said to me in Zimbabwe it was not a shriek a cry a plea for their lives though God did not inform them they had such an intuitive and total confidence in the sovereignty
49:35 -  of God that somehow even though humanly speaking to be cut short when they were doing good for the African villages round about with irrigation systems fish ponds chicken coops and all the kinds of things to aid a downtrodden economy to be
49:50 -  suddenly blotted out makes no human sense at all but not needing explanation and confident in the sovereignty of God that somehow the requirement of their lives was fulfilling a purpose in the mystery of suffering they submitted to
50:07 -  without a screech without a howl without a plea for their earthly lives saints of such a kind multilingual trained who could have made their way in the world lustlessly of whom the world was not worthy and this Jewish doctor who knew
50:24 -  them said you know in the beginning I was irritated by this brother's conversion the way he came on me as a Jew you need to be saved he said but toward the end there was such a change in them that was visible there was a
50:36 -  luster there's a radiance in their faces and when we said that I thought that's not isn't that what it says about Stephen who was the first mother that his face shown like an angel and I have a sense that prophetic intuitive sense
50:49 -  that that is not mere happenstance but is a characteristic of those people who come to such a place of sanctification and separation from the world that the light of God shines in their faces of which then they're not even conscious
51:03 -  that makes the world antagonistic in its darkness against them and actually encourages the opposition and the persecution and even the martyrdom it's the mystery of suffering that we need again to know and to understand and to
51:21 -  embrace is not some odious thing but even the very genius of the ultimate purpose of God for the church I have not the time this takes a seminar but you look in revelations and in the book of Daniel and it says and power was given
51:34 -  to the beast to overcome the saints and he vexed him and wore them out where was God who allowed and even gave him the power to overcome the church because they who were the harlot of Babylon is swollen with the blood of the prophets
51:55 -  and the Apostles and of the saints and of the martyrs for Jesus Christ who hold who have the word others testimony and love not their lives unto death no wonder that the hope of eternal reward was such a dimension and a quotient in
52:23 -  the early church has been so lost to us who thinks in those terms today and I want to tell you their folks that if we don't we will not be able to stand when the pressure comes on if our sense of gratification is solely centered in this
52:39 -  world and through men we will topple like the proverbial deck of cards we need to have a conscious appreciation and an anticipation of a reward that is future and that is eternal henceforth there is laid up for me Paul says the
52:53 -  victors crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me and recompense me on that great day and not to me only but also to all those who have loved and yearned for and welcomed his appearing with the God that
53:10 -  we could spend 15 minutes just on this one verse alone that even acknowledges that there is a great day is that enough vocabulary we speak about the day of the Lord the day of the soon appearing the day of his judgment the day of his wrath
53:25 -  the early church did that was so predominant in their vocabulary but completely lost to us so that every day is like another day because we have not the consciousness of that day there's a day coming and it's soon and it's at the
53:41 -  door it's shortly to come to pass it's at hand and we need to know it and we need to live in the light of its expectation for though its judgment for a blaspheming mankind it is vindication and glory for the saints who endure
53:58 -  until the end in the hope of the crown of righteousness which is their reward I'll tell you what in 25 years as a believer and over 20 years in full-time ministry I have never felt so foolish as I do like this moment there's something
54:13 -  about speaking those words now in 1990 in North Carolina to a very precious and and impressive Christian congregation that makes those words almost just jam up in your mouth they seem so contradictory so out of place so
54:33 -  something is wrong folks either those words are dated and archaic and have no place in our consciousness or something is wrong with us that the very speaking of them in the congregation of the Saints seems so awkward and inopportune
54:47 -  we need to come to greater conformity with the things that are eschatological and apocalyptic that is to say to be saints of God at last I want to pray for that I want you to join me in that prayer I don't know I want to give you
55:03 -  an invitation I don't know how to say it but I know that there's a Lord waiting in the wings so to speak and that this is not for everyone to be in the overcoming church is not by virtue of conscription it's the volunteer army of
55:18 -  God and the discipline for it begins now where we're soft where we've been spoiled where we have indulged ourselves where we've been casual where we've cut corners there's a God who is waiting even now if we will say yes to him to
55:36 -  attend to those very things and his great love that we might stand let's bow before him this morning who is the captain of the host who is before us with his sword in hand knowing better than we of the things that shall
55:59 -  shortly come to pass Lord precious God thank you for looking upon us thank you my God for the hour that has struck for the time that has come we are embarrassed my God we feel ourselves out of shape we're not prepared for it my God we have
56:23 -  embraced the mentality of the world that makes one Sunday like another we have no conscious sense that we're moving toward a consummation as the people of God or that anything of an ultimate kind should be required of us we have been
56:39 -  essentially I get by people we thank you that you've called us to a radical last day's heroism and courage of the kind my God that has preceded us and with whom this morning we want to see ourselves in conscious continuum and continuation so I
57:01 -  asked you to look upon your people my God who are evidently ready for such a word as this and to take them at their word as they respond to you now by saying yes look whatever takes whatever discipline whatever dealing whatever
57:18 -  trial to shape to affect to form my character and my life my integration with your people to be the end time and overcoming remnant people of God I say yes Lord let it come if that's your prayer would you stand before the Lord
57:40 -  kind of strange to give an invitation before the final meeting but there's some of you who will not be here tonight we need to make this affirmation now if you think that this is some kind of evangelical fit and joddle some kind of
57:59 -  flourish for the end of a service you are deceived this is solemn God takes this seriously he's taking you at your response if you not understood that and you're not sure you'll be better sitting that to make of this a light plaything
58:18 -  out of a reflex action Lord in Jesus name has been minister appointed for this speaking and for this invitation and call I ask you Holy One of all to seal by name every soul that has stood in response to your speaking and to your
58:38 -  invitation knowing that it means a release of things that have been waiting in reserve till now of trials and of dealings and of kinds of sufferings that we all would shrink from but recognize that coming from your hand
58:53 -  it is very love and we should not my God shamefully fail you in the day of our testing thank you my God that you're preparing this now for the things that shortly to come to pass I bless these people who have stood and I bless my God
59:11 -  this congregation I bless the church of this locality my God may there be a consequence as we have been praying both in time and eternity for this response both in this age and in the ages to come feel my God what you have transacted here
59:29 -  this morning that is solemn and ultimate and serious and bring us to apostolic and prophetic stature to the eternal praise of your glory now and forever in Jesus name we pray and God standing people said God bless you I didn't
59:50 -  mention but two of my books are outside the only two I have both are remarkable both are out of print and both deserve to be circulated to God's people the first is the journal of my conversion 25 years ago it's a book written by an
01:00:06 -  atheist in the process of being apprehended by God it's a tremendous document of the reality of God to deal with a Jewish atheist of a Marxist persuasion and to show himself real in the struggle that my Jewish soul went
01:00:19 -  through over the issue of Jesus the letters in the book their colleagues in California are the act copies of the actual letters that were sent to put this in the hands of a Jew or an intellectual is a remarkable instrument
01:00:30 -  of God it's very candid and you'll see the value this is a lot later book of four principal messages the first one is about Joseph but he refused and more act message now than when the book was first published another classic word on
01:00:47 -  Elijah on the Sabbath of God about act 16 of apostolic commitment and suffering so I commend both books we don't sell them I let the Lord speak to you I think the two of them what should I say four bucks seven bucks eleven
