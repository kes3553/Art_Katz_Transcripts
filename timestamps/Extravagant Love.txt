Extravagant Love

00:00 -  and I'm far from any kind of authority and I'm far from any kind of authority my prayer is that the Lord will minister to me this morning as much as you my prayer is that the Lord will minister to me this morning as much as you
00:14 -  that we all of us together will be on the receiving end because our need is desperate and few of us have any actual knowledge of this subject
00:27 -  and in fact, not that I'm the most extensive reader around which is not that I am the most extensive reader that exists but there seems to be a lack of really profound Christian literature on this subject
00:39 -  and I think that the answer is not to be found because there's a lack of writing skills But I don't think the answer is that there's a lack of writing skills and I don't think the answer is that there's a lack of writing skills
00:58 -  but just a lack of actual knowledge and experience of this love So I would recommend to you the one from whom I am reading this morning, Basilea Slink I've not found anyone like her
01:18 -  when it comes to the knowledge of first love also called bridal love and just again to remind you that the condition in which we shall be found at the very end
01:33 -  and the consummation of all of God's redemptive work at the final end of the ages is as a bride adorned for the bridegroom I don't think that we should ever lose sight of that
01:51 -  It could easily happen when we become embroiled in what is immediately before us the necessities for evangelism, the issues of discipleship the needs that are in the world
02:11 -  but I think it's good to keep our eyes toward heaven look up Jesus said when these things begin to come to pass, look up
02:23 -  and these things have already begun to come to pass the horrible fulfillment of the end time things which makes our looking up all the more urgent and necessary
02:41 -  setting our affections on the things above not because it's a technical requirement but because it's where Christ is
02:57 -  don't you admire the genius of God don't you admire the genius of God that he has so established things
03:10 -  that no kind of mechanical discipleship will suffice only love any other obedience will run out
03:26 -  but only love goes beyond only love will compel you to look up and keep your affections set there
03:37 -  it cannot be imposed as a mechanical requirement it is the logic of love itself it inheres in love
03:52 -  it is built in to love so there is one requirement foremost above every other consideration we must become passionate lovers of God
04:10 -  we have got to know in our actual experience what bridal love is also called first love first because it puts him before every other consideration
04:25 -  and bridal because it has eyes only for him because it's intense and burning nothing in the world has prepared us for this
04:40 -  even our previous shabby romantic experiences even our previous shabby romantic experiences the casual matter-of-fact spirit of the world
04:56 -  the everyday, practical spirit of the world this business-as-usual mentality this ordinary business-as-usual mentality
05:09 -  casual and passing relationships have not fitted us for this kind of intense love have not fitted us for this kind of intense love
05:23 -  so let me read a little bit about it from Bachelier Sling's book so let me read a little bit about it from Bachelier Sling's book I wish I could read it all from cover to cover for you
05:31 -  I wish I could read it all from cover to cover for you because she describes how she was quite successful in ministry because she describes how she was quite successful in ministry
05:41 -  many doors were opened to her everywhere she was an admirable Bible teacher serving God diligently
05:52 -  very content with her successful Christian life enjoying the applause and the commendation of others enjoying the applause and the commendation of others
06:03 -  until God convicted her of one thing she had not obeyed the commandment especially the first
06:15 -  thou shalt love no ifs, no ands, or buts, thou shalt and not any kind of love either
06:27 -  but with all thy heart all thy heart all thy mind
06:35 -  all thy strength the total call of a total God who has answered that commandment
06:45 -  how many of us now recognize the impossibility of the faith this is not some clever alternative to Judaism or Judaism with a new wrinkle
07:01 -  this is altogether a devastatingly other thing impossible to human attainment it must be of God
07:17 -  through God for God that he be all in all
07:24 -  for this very bridal love that we are discussing itself comes from him it's heavenly
07:34 -  therefore it's burning because God himself is a consuming fire it cannot be fabricated from the earth
07:43 -  not a matter of personal temperament it can't be drummed up or worked up it comes from above
07:52 -  and it returns to above through vessels who are open to receive it who will put away their earthly contents
08:04 -  where the flesh or that enmity with the spirit is lustrous against the spirit it is always in contention with the spirit
08:17 -  the good is always the enemy of the perfect and our light kind of Christian affection our ability to give each other little hugs
08:34 -  our ability to give each other little hugs and how you doing brother is always contending against this pure and burning love
08:49 -  which would far eclipse it I was sharing with Paul and Wilbert at lunch yesterday about our community in northern Minnesota
09:05 -  how the lord has sent us some really precious saints their very coming to us is already the evidence of true commitment who wants to live in 30-40 degrees below zero weather
09:24 -  and winter is the largest season of the year it doesn't end until May and it begins in October
09:38 -  so people don't come to us for little life vacations let alone give up their homes, their security, their businesses and their private lifestyle let alone give up their homes, their businesses and their private lifestyle
09:59 -  to make ice in the winter and mud in the sleds and mosquitoes in the summer but there is no exception to those who have come they have not cracked up within weeks or months of their coming
10:17 -  they have not cracked up within weeks or months of their coming where the seams have burst and the stuffing has come out of their little Christian dolls precious charismatic saints
10:36 -  they had it all together they talked profoundly about the body of Christ the love of God
10:44 -  ministry until the pressures became intense the intensity of this daily life together
10:54 -  and the little porcelain figurine begins to crack and then come undone altogether and out of that death comes the reality of a resurrection life
11:12 -  people who show themselves so kind, so loving for the first week I wondered to what degree we are all in a condition of deception
11:27 -  that our true condition simply has not been revealed because we have not been together intensely enough and long enough for God to reveal it
11:44 -  I would say the greatest obstacle to this first and bridal love is our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have
11:59 -  our own stubborn unwillingness to give up the measure that we have our own unwillingness to give up the earthly counterpart our own unwillingness to give up our earthly counterpart
12:13 -  it is only in the place of suffering and death that it happens and it is a suffering and death when it does happen that darkness comes over the earth
12:28 -  before there is a breakthrough a pressing through the veil of the greater glory
12:44 -  what is this bridal love, this first love? it has eyes for the bridegroom alone it is the end of all flirting
13:00 -  roving eyes why do we carry on like that? because our hearts are not yet filled to the uttermost
13:13 -  and there is room for a little something extra and we are scanning the horizon to see where it might come because our hearts are not filled to overflowing with the love of him alone
13:33 -  I tell you children, I did not know what the word filled meant as many times as I have used it as a Pentecostal until I was travelling through the American midwest in the harvest season
13:52 -  it was last year they had what they called a bumper crop, an enormous success in the harvest and the corn cribs were filled up to overflowing and were piled over on the ground in yet another heap
14:16 -  and then I understood what it meant to be filled even coming to the brim is not enough it has got to flow over
14:30 -  and maybe this is exactly where our Christian life falls short many of us are far below the full line in love and remember that it is a faith which works by love
14:50 -  how many of us have not seen it working? not because we lack the faith but because we lack the love
15:03 -  I can almost fall on my face right now before God at the genius of God who insists upon the two together
15:17 -  and will not let us be sufficient with the one without the other and he will not let us be sufficient with the one without the other can you imagine what we would be if we were great men and women of faith without love?
15:41 -  it would be a horror of horrors some kind of bristling spiritual efficiency a pharisaical know-it-all
15:58 -  ready to do but loveless I'm glad that God insisted
16:06 -  it's the faith that works by love are you filled to overflowing? and maybe it can be said that we really do not touch the world
16:21 -  we can pressure our vehicles with stickers and bumper slogans and all these things we can have campaigns to wear blue in the faith and make our knuckles bloody from knocking on doors
16:40 -  and we really have not impressed the world until the fragrance of his love overflows to me dear children, this is a first and primary need
16:57 -  it has taken me 15 years to see it and I could kick myself that I didn't realize
17:08 -  why the first commandment is the first commandment thou shalt love what good are the other nine?
17:22 -  and indeed how can they be fulfilled if we have not yet met this first requirement it's only love that gives the enablement
17:38 -  it's only love that provokes and motivates us to be faithful in all the requirements of God God has put it first
17:54 -  but we have put it last and we need to reestablish our priorities and seek first this love
18:07 -  to the exclusion of all else and I have told God again and again and again not only for myself but for my community
18:20 -  and above every other consideration this one thing should mark us that we are passionate lovers of God I think it will save us from every error
18:40 -  and everything else will follow it has eyes for the bridegroom alone such an absoluteness seems utterly lacking in my own life
18:54 -  hasn't God been speaking to us about the things that are absolute? total and unconditional above and below
19:11 -  such a severity, such a clear demarcation in his perspective a line of separation but not in our own view
19:27 -  for which reason we have not recognized this need of a total utterness toward God an utterness toward God
19:43 -  an absoluteness toward God you think in your own experience when have you met such a believer
19:52 -  that displays this kind of absoluteness and utterness toward God who is absolutely impervious to the world who is immune to the world
20:07 -  he simply cannot be attracted it's all the same to him to abound, to abate
20:16 -  to increase or to decrease it's all the same to him to abound, to abate
20:25 -  to increase or to decrease what kind of a car he's in, when he's driving, when he eats or doesn't eat what he wears or doesn't wear, what he has or doesn't have
20:39 -  single eyes toward God such an utterness this has about it, the flavor of things apostolic
20:55 -  this has about it, the flavor of things apostolic can I read a little quotation from Oswald Chambers? can I read a little quotation from Oswald Chambers?
21:04 -  a saint is a sacramental personality a saint is a sacramental personality sacramental, sacramenteel, is that Dutch?
21:13 -  I don't know that it's sacramental it's a catholic word, sacramental sacramenteel, do you understand that?
21:22 -  a saint is a sacramental personality a saint is a sacramental personality where did Oswald Chambers get that?
21:31 -  from heaven one through whom the presence of God comes to others one through whom the presence of God comes to others
21:40 -  I had written this a few months ago and this morning by accident my eye fell upon it again I had written this a few months ago
21:50 -  I added a further question What then should it's corporate expressions be? what then should it's corporate expressions be?
22:03 -  can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities can you imagine a church made up of sacramental personalities
22:15 -  a whole body that has this utterness toward God marked by first bridal love watch out world
22:29 -  they would not be able to resist the glory of such a people this love gives up all others it is a spin-thrift love
22:44 -  a lavish love that doesn't count the pennies one of the amusing, if not sad and melancholy experiences that men like me face continually
23:06 -  is the payment we receive for services rendered how can you put a price on the ministry? how can you put a price on the ministry?
23:15 -  shall it be so much per day? shall it be so much per day? so much per lecture?
23:24 -  how do we evaluate its worth? shall we pay according to need? shall we pay according to need?
23:33 -  you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches? you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches? you know what I'm struck in my heart with in most of my experience with churches?
23:42 -  they're very... they are very minimal they are very minimal they're satisfied to be adequate
23:51 -  I almost feel like a man being paid for his services I almost feel like
24:00 -  a man being paid for his services but there is nothing extravagant about their gesture it's stingy, it's narrow
24:14 -  and my sadness is not for me that I'm being denied because the Lord sees to me aboundingly I'm sad for their sake
24:29 -  and this is especially true in Europe because they have not learned how to give they don't know what extravagance means
24:44 -  because the kind of extravagance that is pleasing in the Lord's sight is not something which you can be taught or instructed it's the overflow of love
25:01 -  the love to give that must give so I see this as a symptom of lovelessness a worldly mechanical attitude
25:16 -  so much paid for services rendered not the fragrance of Christ it's the stink of the world
25:28 -  of a church that needs to be profoundly converted to the lavish love of God that gives everything to the beloved
25:46 -  I want to examine with you this morning a little episode in Luke the 7th chapter do you remember when Jesus was invited in the 36th verse to come to the house of a Pharisee to eat
26:07 -  and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment
26:16 -  and stood at his feet behind him waiting for the Lord to come and the Lord said to her, Jesus, come to the house of a Pharisee to eat and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner
26:25 -  brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet
26:34 -  and anointed them with the ointment and when the Pharisee which had bitten him sort he spoke within himself saying, this man if he were a prophet
26:43 -  would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner Jesus answering said unto him, Simon
26:52 -  I have something to say unto thee and I think that the Lord has also something to say unto us you want me to read it?
27:01 -  no, I think that they can follow there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50
27:10 -  and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said, I suppose that he
27:20 -  to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, see thou this woman
27:29 -  I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears
27:38 -  and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in
27:47 -  hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
27:56 -  wherefore I say unto thee her sins which on many are forgiven for she loved much
28:05 -  but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that said it met with and began to say within themselves
28:14 -  who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
28:23 -  it's a remarkable and precious episode there are two others like it in the gospels
28:36 -  in all three episodes a woman is the chief actor you know how foolish women can get they're not practical like us fellows
28:50 -  they're so reckless and mindless they'll waste anything this is my single greatest issue with my wife
29:00 -  she just does not have a proper Jewish sense of economy we have guests and she's lavish I would have put out just a little salad, a little of this
29:18 -  no two salads, three salads coffee and tea cake and cookies
29:27 -  cake and cookies it's amazing how that kind of lavishness will drive a man to a fury
29:45 -  so I really understand the reaction of the disciples in one of these episodes when the woman came with the alabaster box and broke it it says they were filled with indignation
29:56 -  as I said so what purpose is this waste? why this ointment could have been sold and the money could have been distributed to the poor
30:10 -  could have bought literature or tracts they couldn't understand this act they were offended by it
30:23 -  and it is still true to this very day I met a precious young Christian on this trip that when he first came to the Lord he came in first love
30:40 -  the Lord swept him off his feet the Lord threw him upside down
30:54 -  he was so in love with the Lord that he would walk against a wall he was already in heaven but you know what the more experienced Christians say
31:08 -  you'll get over this you'll come down to normal and sure enough when they said this enough
31:17 -  he did they could not stand to see someone so lost in love to God it intimidated them
31:32 -  they wanted to make him as they were you'll get over this it's true to this day
31:41 -  the disciples have indignation at this kind of lavish extravagance that pours itself out upon the Lord
31:58 -  and is not satisfied with just the minimal requirement or obligation this Pharisee thought he was in real sport the other Pharisees wouldn't touch Jesus with a ten-foot pole
32:22 -  he was quite an emancipated fellow quite liberal and he was going to have this character into his house to eat
32:32 -  and he fed him I'm sure it was adequate but he was quite proud of his largesse of soul, his hospitality
32:44 -  but a stinking woman came a putrid sinner the Amplified Bible says an especially wicked sinner
32:56 -  and he was very happy the Amplified Bible says an especially wicked sinner and she couldn't even bring herself to stand before the Lord
33:13 -  she stood weeping behind him and she washed his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair
33:29 -  I don't know if you ladies can even understand this today but there was a generation when a woman's hair was her crowning glory it was the best she had
33:46 -  and with that she wiped the feet of the Lord what shall we say also of tears? maybe that's the best we have also
33:59 -  it comes from the inward place I'm not talking about some shabby sentimental tears this wasn't just a tear
34:12 -  she washed the feet of the Lord with her tears it was a profuse overflow it was an...
34:24 -  it was an exceedingly great sufficient to wash a man's feet from the dust of the road I always thought that the scriptures were just being poetic here
34:43 -  and really who can cry that profusely this is a profound deep inner weeping which of us has ever come to that kind of profound breaking in the depths of our being
35:04 -  and it shows I can almost look over this room and know who has had a measure of breaking and who has not do you remember what I quoted to you from Phinney yesterday?
35:20 -  he wouldn't even dream to travel with any man who has not been broken down before the Lord within the space of no more than three weeks
35:32 -  as a frequent and a recurring experience this is not yet the case this is not just a once and for all
35:49 -  but God calling an entire people to live in the spirit of repentance because the more truly spiritual they become the more they recognize the subtlety and the depth of their being
36:13 -  and can say with Paul, I am the chief of sinners it's amazing the kind of conviction that God can bring to sexual I've had an occasion to visit with Basilia Schlink several occasions
36:35 -  and I spoke to her about this I said you speak about the necessity for daily repentance you know how direct we Jews are
36:49 -  but tell me, do you experience this yourself? you impeccable saint you spotless glory
37:02 -  you radiant heavenly being are you trying to tell me that you repent daily? that you are a sinner daily, that you see the necessity for repentance?
37:18 -  she was amazed at my question but of course she said give me an example of what you repented yesterday
37:31 -  and when she gave me the example I repented because it was not anything that I would have thought of as sin
37:43 -  it wasn't any flagrant violation of any kind no real harm was done by it it was only just a little attitude
37:58 -  just an inward disposition of heart that was a little bit sullen it passed in a moment but she broke and repented over it
38:16 -  we had a couple of confessions last night of people who had a critical spirit they confessed it
38:30 -  but that they break and they weep over it maybe we need to see as God sees that in his sight there is no such thing as a small sin
38:45 -  I want to tell you that last night was the most difficult night of my ministry before you in these days I was inwardly struggling and laboring the flow of God was being impeded
39:03 -  I don't know how to explain this I came very prayed up very expectant
39:15 -  believing largely from God for great things I came believing that God would do great things but we didn't get them
39:27 -  I wonder if so much as one or two with a critical spirit are enough I wonder if one or two with a critical spirit are enough to affect the flow and to grieve the spirit of God
39:48 -  if it has not been dismissed by an authentic repentance and sorrow if it has not been dismissed by an authentic repentance and sorrow it seems that the experience of men in true revivals supports this
40:10 -  the man who wrote the definitive book on the revivals in China it is enough for a whole meeting that there is one man who has a wicked spirit and who ruins the whole meeting and then the awakening did not continue
40:44 -  until this person really broke and grieved or the Lord removed him how little do we understand these things?
40:56 -  because we do not understand the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit because we have had only a functional and utilitarian attitude about the Spirit of God because we only have an attitude that wants to make use and really only sees the functioning of the Holy Spirit
41:18 -  only thinking about what He can do for us and through us but not contemplating Him in love love is sensitive toward the beloved
41:31 -  love is sensitive toward the beloved it has a purpose and it feels when the mood of love changes love is very careful not to bring the slightest offense
41:52 -  how little have we had this kind of loving attitude toward the Spirit of God not realizing that the Spirit of God is the very inner essence of Him
42:16 -  how much greater reverence should we have for Him and be careful not to grieve Him by earthly and fleshly attitudes
42:32 -  that are contrary to His essence and personality which is burning love I didn't think that it would be possible to wash someone's feet with tears
42:53 -  but this brother says that in the Chinese revivals the floors were wet with the tears of the saints and I saw it recently in Sweden a young girl bent over a chair
43:13 -  and when she lifted her head the seat was wet with tears and how many of us here has God succeeded in breaking us up in the deep? where these precious tears are to be found
43:38 -  how many of us ourselves are like an alabaster box very nice to look upon singing all of the appropriate choruses
43:53 -  very expert in the current vocabulary and terminology impressive outward vessels thinking to serve God from that basis
44:09 -  and not recognizing that something has to come from the deep and not recognizing that something has to come from the deep and that can only flow out of brokenness
44:33 -  I don't know as much about evangelism as you that's not my calling but I just want to suggest what I think will have much to do with God's end time evangelism
44:45 -  but I just want to suggest what I think will have much to do with God's end time evangelism described in 2 Corinthians 2 in the 14th and the 16th verses
45:15 -  14 to the 16th verses 14 to the 16th verses 14 to the 16th verses
45:27 -  now thanks be unto God who always causes the triumph in Christ and then comes this tremendous statement and make it manifest the savor or the fragrance
45:39 -  of his knowledge by us in every place remember seeing that lately remember seeing that lately
45:49 -  isn't that a strange expression the fragrance of his knowledge the fragrance of his knowledge
46:01 -  we never think of knowledge as a fragrance let alone that it should be made manifest by us let alone that it should be made manifest by us
46:11 -  in every place have you ever thought about the knowledge of him as a fragrance have you ever thought about the knowledge of him as a fragrance
46:37 -  are you really disappointing me this morning I thought you were kind of a two-fisted rugged disciple type but this emphasis on fragrances surprises me
46:53 -  but this emphasis on fragrances surprises me this is too feminine a category this is too feminine
47:05 -  but still it says in the Gospel that the woman who came and broke the alabaster the whole house was filled with the fragrance how many of us are perfectly correct
47:23 -  and very right in our conduct and activity and service
47:33 -  but there is no fragrance the fragrance of the knowledge of him that can really turn the heads of men
47:47 -  when mere words fail have you really pondered what Jesus said to the disciples have you really pondered what Jesus said to the disciples
48:01 -  leave this woman alone for she has done a good work on me I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work
48:13 -  I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work I tell you you'll have to search the scriptures to find where he has ever celebrated anybody else's act as being a good work he even went further
48:29 -  where this good news is preached in the world this that this woman has done shall be spoken as a memorial unto her this that this woman has done shall be spoken as a memorial unto her
48:45 -  the difference between the attitude of the disciples and the attitude of Jesus the difference between the attitude of the disciples and the attitude of Jesus just as great as the difference between Jesus and Peter in yesterday's message
49:03 -  Jesus celebrated this act wherever this gospel shall be proclaimed are you conscious of how many gospels are being proclaimed today
49:15 -  are you conscious of how many gospels are being proclaimed today gospels of prosperity gospels of self interest
49:27 -  accept Jesus and you'll receive these benefits accept Jesus and you'll receive these benefits but where this gospel shall be proclaimed
49:39 -  that makes manifest the knowledge of him what was the greatest revelation of the knowledge of him in my opinion it came on the cross
49:51 -  in his suffering and brokenness something was exhibited in that suffering in that moment of ultimate agony
50:03 -  in that moment of ultimate agony and overwhelmed even the Roman centurion who was standing at the foot of the cross while the proud Psyrothaical Jews were crying
50:21 -  come down from the cross and we'll believe you this dumb centurion this mere gentile
50:33 -  who had no religious training a pagan of pagans who had seen emperors deified as God
50:51 -  in great pomp and ceremony saw this pitiful naked figure on the cross saw this pitiful naked figure on the cross
51:05 -  and the ultimate agony of his suffering yielding up his ghost and he cried out surely this is the son of God
51:19 -  something was revealed even to this unthinking club that only suffering can reveal
51:35 -  something somehow gets right to the heart of the issue cuts through subterfuge and deceit and concealment something in the suffering of Jesus and the way that he died
51:53 -  as a broken vessel poured out for the world that brought some knowledge into the soul of this Roman that he was compelled to cry out surely this is the son of God
52:17 -  the event was so enormous that even the dead had to come out of their graves and enter into the holy city it rent the veil of the temple
52:29 -  and cracked the stones and it will do so again and again as often as God and his people
52:41 -  will reveal him in their brokenness it's the ultimate revelation
52:49 -  to an unbelieving world to an unbelieving world of God as he really is
53:01 -  nothing reveals the love of God so much as God crucified wherever this Gospel shall be proclaimed in all the world
53:15 -  this that this woman hath done shall be spoken of because this act of hers this act of lavish love
53:25 -  this extravagance that was not just careful to screw up the cap and spill out a few drops this utter recklessness which smashed the box
53:43 -  and poured lavishly out over the head of the Lord so that the whole house was filled with the fragrance is a revelation of the heart of the Gospel itself
53:59 -  of the heart of God himself and it cannot be demonstrated by those whose alabaster boxes are still together
54:11 -  who are just measuring out a few appropriate drops giving the minimal requirements and have not yet come to the extravagance of love
54:25 -  Jesus said to the Pharisee, I came into your house and you gave me no water for my feet or you failed even to give the minimal obligations
54:37 -  you didn't even give me any kind of a cheap oil for my head you didn't even greet me with a kiss on my cheek but this woman
54:47 -  this especially wicked sinner has not ceased from the moment I have come in to wash my feet with her tears
54:57 -  and wipe them with her hair and have anointed me with this oil and have anointed me with this oil
55:09 -  tell me there were two men who owed a debt one owed more and one owed less and which of the two shall
55:19 -  love that creditor more who forgives their debt and which of the two shall
55:27 -  love that creditor more who forgives their debt oh he said the one who has the greater debt
55:41 -  Jesus said you've answered correctly he who has been forgiven much loves much
55:49 -  wouldn't it be an advantage for us if we were especially wicked sinners and knew it as this woman knew it
56:01 -  and knew it as this woman knew it because she knew herself as she really was she also knew who he was
56:11 -  whose feet were bathed with her tears but a religious Pharisee who was especially correct
56:27 -  did everything right and had a proper understanding he said if this man were a prophet
56:37 -  he would know but the one who sat at his table was far greater than a prophet
56:47 -  but the correct religionist could not see it he could not recognize Jesus because he could not see himself that is a revelation that comes only to especially wicked sinners
57:07 -  who are broken over it and are weeping with gratitude for the forgiveness that is extended to them
57:19 -  by him whose feet they wash by him whose feet they wash when Christ came into your house how did you receive him
57:35 -  and how have you received him since have you accorded to him the minimal things the necessary obligations
57:47 -  the minimal amount of prayer the appropriate amount of service you've been feeding him, you've had him to your table
58:01 -  maybe you've greeted him with a peck on the cheek a little kiss on the cheek I came into your house and you gave me no water for my feet
58:17 -  you didn't greet me with a kiss you gave me no oil for my hair how have you treated the Lord since he came into your house
58:35 -  most of us are minimal we get by we give the appropriate amount that's required
58:43 -  how can you measure this really what have you been pouring out on the body of Christ remember it says that she poured this upon his head
59:03 -  but when he spoke of it he said she has poured this upon my body what is poured upon the head is upon the body and what is poured upon the body is poured upon the head
59:27 -  what have you poured out upon the body in the extravagance of love that has filled the room with the fragrance
59:39 -  even the world knows how to be sociable and can be fraternal you can give a back slap and a bear hug
59:53 -  how are you doing brothers but there's no fragrance of the knowledge of him
01:00:05 -  that is made manifest by us in every place in every place
01:00:29 -  that this love has overwhelming power to go on even when obedience has spent itself
01:00:43 -  love continues on it flows over because this love joins us with the bridegroom
01:01:01 -  this bride that is adorned for the bridegroom that comes down from heaven this bride that is adorned for the bridegroom
01:01:13 -  is having the glory of God being like him because she's joined with him
01:01:27 -  in love any other kind of joining is illicit, illegal
01:01:35 -  sinful it's an intimate union with the Lord
01:01:47 -  by which you receive of his life and make it manifest again he'll not be satisfied with a peck on the cheek
01:02:01 -  he waits for lovers who'll be joined with him intimately has that union taken place with you
01:02:21 -  or have you just rendered to him the minimal obligation since he came into your house he who has been forgiven much, loves much
01:02:43 -  that's the key to this love you can't pump it up you can't manufacture this
01:02:53 -  it flows out with the tears of brokenness
01:03:01 -  for repentance from those who have great debts and cannot pay them who are especially wicked sinners
01:03:13 -  we really have a choice before us this morning I asked you last night, who do you more resemble, Nicodemus or Jesus the proud Pharisee
01:03:29 -  or the man of spirit I might well ask you the question this morning who do you more resemble
01:03:41 -  the correct Pharisee the religious who thought he was doing very generously to have him into his arms or the broken prostitute who washed his feet with her tears
01:03:55 -  or the broken prostitute who washed his feet with her tears I'll tell you how naive I am I don't think that there's any middle course
01:04:15 -  I think it's the one or the other I don't think that there's any other category I don't think that there's any other category
01:04:27 -  you're proud and Pharisee correct, minimal doing our obligations
01:04:33 -  or we're broken and extravagant and lavish in our love he said to her
01:04:53 -  thy faith has saved thee, go in peace faith is more than just subscribing to the correct doctrine true faith is an extravagant act of love
01:05:15 -  that has recognized who he is that has recognized who he is because it sees who we are
01:05:25 -  because this love also sees who we are this translation says your faith has saved you, go enter into your peace in freedom from all of the distresses that are experienced as a result of sin
01:05:43 -  the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin this is the answer to those of you who are still being harassed
01:06:01 -  these days have been filled with confessional sin in a kind of minimal way in the sense of fulfilling a required obligation
01:06:17 -  in the sense of fulfilling a required obligation but it is not a confession that has been extravagant lavish
01:06:29 -  until in tears that would enable you to go in peace in freedom from all of the distresses
01:06:41 -  in freedom from all of the vexations vexations in an annoyance of strife
01:06:55 -  that are experienced as a result of sin it is interesting that all of the disciples fled Jesus in his ultimate suffering
01:07:13 -  but I form a prostitute with that across wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us
01:07:25 -  wouldn't it be humbling and humiliating for us to learn that one former prostitute like that in the extravagance of her love
01:07:41 -  which comes out of a true repentance which comes out of a true repentance which comes out of a true repentance
01:07:49 -  from a particularly bad sin that he did more to bless the Lord to delight his heart
01:08:01 -  and to make him known than all of our acts of discipleship love is the answer
01:08:11 -  first love you can't pump it up your earthly thing is in the way
01:08:21 -  your light human affection you need to repent of it as an inadequate substitute
01:08:37 -  for that which is divine there is a connection between repentance and love there is a connection between repentance and love
01:08:51 -  may we see it by the eye of the spirit and not be proud religionists who cannot see
01:09:07 -  who call Jesus teacher who call Jesus teacher if this man were a prophet
01:09:17 -  and dignified for the man as well as for the woman therefore not going into may the house be filled with the fragrance
01:09:29 -  the house of God in the end days beyond all our programs and all our activities
01:09:39 -  all of our doing for God may this one thing characterize us above all the house is filled with the fragrance
01:09:53 -  of the knowledge of him made manifest by us in every place out of our own brokenness
01:10:05 -  have you asked the Lord for that? have you paid your debts, can you? or yours were not as great as hers
01:10:19 -  she was an especially wicked sinner and we're not ours were the smallest sins
01:10:29 -  critical spirit let us see as the Lord sees and to weep over it
01:10:39 -  only the Lord can perform this to those who are yielded to him for his precious breaking process
01:10:53 -  above all of the glorious experiences that I have known in God in 15 years enormous victories in ministry great breakthroughs in proclaiming the word
01:11:09 -  there's nothing that I cherish more than when the Lord brings this breaking I remember one time I was actually under the table at a banquet
01:11:31 -  I was a mess to look at I had exhausted all of my handkerchiefs and tissues my face was awash with tears
01:11:49 -  I was mopping my face with the tablecloth that left over the table I was under the table, I didn't want to be seen of men I had an inward breaking by God
01:12:07 -  and some great men of God whose shoes I was unworthy to unlace looked at the table cloth could I help you brother?
01:12:25 -  and I burst again had the expression of his love when you glimpse the love of God
01:12:37 -  it breaks your heart may he do it for us this morning may we rise above me, electors
01:12:51 -  electors, electors, electors may we receive the word of God as an event that breaks us
01:13:05 -  that we see by the eye of the spirit we are especially wicked in this state to be a prostitute is to be especially wicked
01:13:19 -  a woman who has given her body to men for gains but to be a proud religioner correct and self-satisfied
01:13:33 -  utterly assured in his knowledge who is only minimal to God and to God's people
01:13:47 -  is worse shall we pray?
