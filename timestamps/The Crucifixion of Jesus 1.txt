The Crucifixion of Jesus 1

00:00 -  So Lord, again, increase our discernment, open our understanding, enter us into the divine perspective, for we confess that we don't know as we ought to know, and there's knowing and knowing.
00:19 -  So we're asking, my God, for that knowledge into our deeps that affects and colors our whole soul and the way in which we perceive everything and anything has got to be affected by this single greatest episode in the history of man, the crucifixion of your son and the
00:43 -  gospel, my God, of which it is its heart. So again, be our teacher, Lord, you who bore the pains of it and communicate to us, my God, what only you can in your own way.
00:58 -  We thank you again for the privilege in Jesus name. Amen. Well, you see the battery of books and things that I have here dip in as the Lord guides.
01:13 -  I was impressed with this book by a British theologian, a lady, because she opens up with the question of the absurdity of the gospel, that God himself would suffer crucifixion, sending his son to suffer the most barbaric form of punishment which men could devise.
01:41 -  So we need to understand that, because the very beginning of the book of Romans, Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel, implying that there could be grounds for being ashamed of it or being embarrassed with what that message itself is, because especially to the
01:59 -  generation then who had opportunity to observe crucifixion, if not of Jesus, of any number of victims that were proliferated the highways, both in Rome and in any of their provinces, the unique Roman form of death for criminals and for slaves in rebellion.
02:24 -  Otherwise, capital punishment was beheading, more appropriate to the dignity of the criminal. But for the worst cases, crucifixion and the death could linger on for three or four or more days. So you watch these people writhing in their remarkable agony, and only Satan could have
02:53 -  conceived of so ingenious a method for bringing death to man. So where does Paul talk about, in Philippians, that Jesus emptied himself and took upon himself the form of a man, even a slave, son of David, of Israel, and suffered death, even the death of the cross,
03:17 -  the word even is, even that death, that ultimately humiliating and excruciating death, is what this son suffered, and that that's at the heart of the gospel. So we need to be sufficiently staggered or our proclamation of the gospel will suffer loss.
03:37 -  We've got to be reminded of how foolish and offensive a message it is from the very first, and because that brings home the whole question of why would God allow it? Why did his son have to suffer it? What was the enormity called sin that was so vile that no form
04:05 -  of expiation would satisfy the divine justice of God than this cruel form of death for his son? You got the idea? It's like asking a Jew about the Nazi holocaust. What could we have done? For what could we have been guilty that could in any way justify such a judgment upon us
04:30 -  that took six million of our lives, obliterated European Jewry, and counted in its victims a million and a half children and infants? What could we have done? What could we have been so guilty as to justify such an act, such a crucifixion of the nation Israel? So the same question could
04:53 -  be raised for the crucifixion of Jesus. What was the enormity of the sin for which only his death in such a form could suffice? And if we don't ask that question and come to some sense of it, we do not know sin as we ought. And if we do not know sin, we do not know righteousness.
05:15 -  And if we do not know sin nor righteousness, we do not know God. Everything collapses at the very beginning and we're condemned to some kind of shallow formula about are you saved brother, from which we ourselves have not been saved
05:31 -  sufficiently until we see the magnitude of what it is which God is saving us. The wrath of God. So let me read a little bit of her description of this Roman form of execution as a good point of beginning. And while I'm reading, you can look at this Holy Ghost
05:52 -  masterpiece. I don't know of another painting like it that depicts so realistically the suffering where you see pieces of wood, splinter, glass, whatever it was that was on the end of that cat and moutain tails talk about cruelty just to be flocked with this instrument, which was the
06:15 -  preparation for the cross of all of its victims and then have to carry the cross on the back that had been laid bare to the bone by that flagellation is already excruciating. We can almost say that the death of the cross was itself a relief from the pain that they were bearing from that very first.
06:35 -  So you see it in this painting, things sticking out of the flesh and the tincture. This depiction is not like the original. No reprint is. But in the original, the skin almost has the color of a dangrenous hue. The body is already decomposing. Death has set in. And you look at the face,
06:57 -  it's not like the pictures you see of Jesus on the cross looking like a ballet dancer. It's a man with his head down on his chest and his mouth is parted and his lips are white. And he's a suffering victim. And to add to that, the verbal abuse, the taunts and mocks of his own
07:16 -  people, if anything would drive someone to a fury, it's to be falsely accused and provoked while you're suffering for the very benefit of those who are accusing you. Come down from the cross and we will believe you. They mocked him. If you'll be the son of God, it's almost like Satan's taunt
07:36 -  of Jesus after his baptism in the Jordan. If you'll be the son of God, come down. Of course, you couldn't come down, not physically, but to come down would have been to nullify the whole purpose for being nailed. So I'm not rehearsing this because I have a maudlin propensity for
08:01 -  torture and love to dwell on the gory details, but we need to be exercised a little bit. We need to be jabbed in our deeps lest we trivialize this as in fact Catholicism has and sentimentalize it, which is just as effective as negating its importance as the actual
08:24 -  disregard that the Jewish community holds this crucifixion. It is disregarded as non-event of having no especial significance. It's just the unhappy end of a presumer suffering some kind of megalomania about himself as Messiah who ran afoul of the authorities and suffered
08:48 -  this consequence, missing the whole remarkable intent of God to be revealed through this suffering. Because Paul says that this is the revelation of the righteousness of God. How is that the statement of God's righteousness? If you don't know that, have not asked that
09:06 -  question, have not probed it, then how should you know righteousness at all? And how should you know God as righteous? Unless the cross, the heart of the gospel, is the most profound revelation of the righteousness of God. Otherwise, we just have to take it by faith that it says so.
09:26 -  Here we see the righteousness if we rightly interpret this suffering. And she says our problem is simply that we're too used to the Christian story. It's difficult for us to grasp the absurdity, indeed the sheer madness, of the gospel about
09:44 -  a crucified Savior which was proclaimed by the first Christians in a world where the cross was the most barbaric form of punishment which men could devise. So the first proclamation of the gospel is to those who know the form and have seen it and are being told that this one whom
10:05 -  they're celebrating is the very Son of God who has suffered this kind of death. It's as if God has gone out of his way to find the most offensive foundation for faith and salvation that he could conceive. That no man could ever be saved by any extension of himself or by any operation of his
10:31 -  own intelligence because this beggars all rationality. This is totally off the wall and the only way to understand that and to receive it is by the gift of grace, of faith, from faith to faith or you cannot. And in the wonderful book by another German theologian,
10:51 -  JÃ¼rgen Moltmann called The Crucified God, what a title, when I saw that book sticking out of that German bookcase all those years ago while this pastor's wife was sewing my torn pants, I'm sitting in my underwear hitting his study and looking at the bookcase which I'll always do when
11:10 -  I come to your house also because you tell a person by their bookcase what the absence of the same and as I'm gazing over his bookcase when my eye came on that panel, The Crucified God, whistling like somebody threw a switch, electric went through me and I made a resolve in that moment
11:29 -  I am not leaving this house without that book. I don't care whose body I have to step over, I am not leaving without that book and I didn't leave without that book and subsequently I sent him another copy. That book is such a statement, The Crucified God, that God would submit to this
11:49 -  and he quotes in the beginning he said true faith begins where the atheist thinks it should end because the atheist if he has any consideration for God will always conceive of some lofty imagining appropriate to the
12:07 -  dignity of what deities should be but this has no dignity. This is infamous, this is contrary to anything that you think that God should experience himself let alone allow his son to experience. So faith begins where the atheist thinks it should end. It's got to be faith, it can't be
12:29 -  rational agreement by any kind of logic. It's staggering but it's God's wisdom, the cross is God's wisdom and we need to understand why if we had communicated to others and received deeply its significance ourselves. She says we may well share this reluctance to
12:50 -  dwell on its horrors but if we got to understand the significance of the gospel as it was proclaimed in the first century it's essential that we grasp just what crucifixion entailed. Then she goes on to explain it was reserved for slaves, traders
13:08 -  and was the most degrading form of death. The victim died a lingering and horribly painful death. One could therefore inflict the maximum pain on one's enemies or on the criminals being punished and partly was due to the fact that nailing a man up naked whether dead or alive was the greatest
13:28 -  possible indignity to which one could subject him. This thing with the loin cloth is an artistic device. It's not a piece of historically accurate data but gothic artists, renaissance artists have all followed the same tradition of always giving Jesus a loin cloth but what she's
13:51 -  saying is that not only was the suffering physical it was also moral that the victim who has his that the victim who has his hands pinned can't cover himself is exposed to the gaze and view of anyone totally naked. For an orthodox Jew that would be humiliation of the ultimate kind
14:15 -  and so was it for Jesus also. Why did he have to die that way? So that you 2000 years later would not hide and cover yourself that you would be as willing in some measure to be publicly exposed in your nakedness because if you will not you'll not receive the benefit of God's grace
14:36 -  and redemptive working that waits upon the acknowledgement of the truth of your condition but if you cover it and conceal it because of your pride that doesn't want to be exposed you forfeit the benefit of God who wants to meet you in the truth of your condition
14:53 -  nakedly. Maybe we can define church as the willingness and the ability of God's people to be exposed and open and naked not only before God but even before each other because we know that we're not going to be the victim of those who will meanly use those opportunities to gossip
15:17 -  or to take cheap pleasure or delight in our nakedness. We can trust one another in covenant relationship going back to last night to be open naked and revealed so that we might receive prayer correction and all of the sanctifying redemptive work available only in an environment
15:39 -  of that kind. Where do you find the church like that when even the pastors themselves will not come out they just come out to do their thing as the man of faith and power and then when their fingers already go back again into hiding and who's more in need of redemption in truth than
15:59 -  these ministers who are chronically lacking in relational ability and don't want to be seen in the truth of their condition. Got that? So part of our responsibility is to create an environment conducive to the sanctifying work of God that only takes place on the ground of truth.
16:23 -  I can't help talk about nakedness without thinking about Noah and his drunken condition and the great episode in Genesis 9 where Ham who saw him exposed and there's even a hint that he did more than see him exposed but took advantage of his nakedness whatever that means and some
16:44 -  writers even suggest some sneaky kind of sexual thing of a perverse kind by which Ham advantaged himself on a defenseless naked father now drunk and then went out to tell his brothers but how did he tell them hey you want to know because there's something in a young son that likes to
17:05 -  be exalted at the cost of an older father have you ever noticed that but but Shem when he heard it would not be seduced into joining that kind of disrespect but walked backward with a cloak in order to cover his father's nakedness and to
17:25 -  keep his own eyes from in any way beholding it and it and is therefore eternally blessed that Noah says blessed be the God of Shem because Shem could not have done this of his own initiative it's not a normal human response the normal human response is to relish a father who's naked and
17:45 -  take advantage of it and say well he's had his time now I'm taking over he has shown his disqualification it's time for me now to rise and to graduate but Shem did not succumb to that temptation but covered his father and would not look upon his nakedness so what does what does
18:04 -  that mean for us and one brought one side of my mouth I'm saying the church ought to be a place where we can afford to be open transparent and real and then the next side of my mouth I'm saying we ought to cover one another you know that's a paradox but in the paradoxes is the glory of the
18:22 -  faith just to get at the heart of this crucifixion combined the death penalty with excruciating torture and with total humiliation that needs to be factored in not only the physical suffering the moral suffering of total humiliation of the nakedness of an orthodox Jew who is also very
18:47 -  God before the gaze of his people and contempt because he's dying as a criminal between criminals nakedly in that one form of execution reserved for the vilest of the vile got that idea he doesn't die with dignity he dies not only in excruciating torture but in
19:11 -  remarkable humiliation total humiliation and that the flogging that preceded his death sat the victim's strength and shortened the time of torture which could sometimes last for days that's why in the end they often broke the legs of the victims so they could stop they would stop
19:29 -  stretching themselves and then they would asphyxiate as the body fluids drowned them crucifixion was thus an utterly gruesome business a cruel and sadistic form of execution it is hardly surprising that the jewish historian Josephus described it as the most wretched of
19:47 -  deaths in the roman empire it was used primarily to punish slaves the threat was used to keep slaves subservient no wonder then that Paul recognized that his proclamation of christ on the cross was sheer folly and why does he begin in rome and the letter to rome which by the way
20:06 -  is not only Paul's most extensive and systematic statement but is most eloquent the language of the book of romans is superb and presumes a pretty sophisticated audience you just read the very introduction which we'll do shortly Paul's salutation the beginning
20:27 -  uh evidently indicates that the readers are at a level of erudition sophistications probably more than any other of the churches of the ancient world and to this church he writes this book the most systematic survey of his apostolic understanding of the faith and in the very beginning is i'm not
20:49 -  ashamed of the gospel of Jesus christ to a people who in rome the capital of the great emperors empire would likely then be ashamed so the the apostle has to disarm any disposition they would have to be embarrassed at their own message by saying that as the chief of apostles i'm not
21:11 -  ashamed why because this horrible thing is also the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes and if you knew the magnitude of sin in which every human soul abides and the wrath of God that rests upon every human soul in sin the wages of which is death and eternal separation
21:35 -  from God and an anguish of soul eternally that cannot be described then whatever the the subject matter i'm not ashamed of it because i understand that for which it saves us you got the idea if you don't understand the magnitude of sin and the wrath of God upon sin who's angry
21:56 -  with the sinner every day then you will be ashamed you will be offended you've got to see the suffering in the context of what it has come to expiate and that's what we have not seen and that's why we're reviewing this because the whole thrust of this school from its beginning was back to foundations
22:19 -  not just principles of faith but the foundation of foundations the crucified christ the issue of sin judgment atonement without which you can't even begin to talk about sanctification or church of the last days any of those things until you've come to grips with the foundation
22:43 -  of foundations which has this as at its beginning in the wisdom of God but the horror of it needs to strike us so so Paul recognized that the proclamation was folly the idea of a dying God was not without precedent in the ancient world but a gospel about a crucified lord was something
23:10 -  quite different the cross was a symbol of weakness of total impotence the dying Jesus was taunted because he could not save himself and neither so it seemed could his God the cross signified total humiliation and degradation so this is the scandal of the message of the cross
23:39 -  and Jesus says to his followers take up the cross and follow me the scandal of the cross was thus not simply that Jesus had been put to death as a criminal but that the particular death he had suffered was the most barbaric that could be devised moreover this barbaric death had involved
23:57 -  the display of his naked body in public the final utter degradation christian artists not unnaturally have shed have shrunk from this aspect of christ's suffering and have no inhibition in portraying the blood caused by the crown of thorns and the spear thrust but they have shrunk for
24:20 -  portraying the nakedness of christ and the modest loincloth which they add to the body conceals the shame that was an integral part of crucifixion so of what shall we be too proud if God himself suffered this and did he not suffer it to meet the issue of our pride that we would not have a
24:43 -  ground to stand on by which we keep ourselves from public exposure and the kinds of things that will be a humiliation for us if he will suffer that humiliation to what degree then we who follow him should also be willing got the idea and the church is phony baloney it's an institution it's a play
25:07 -  thing to the degree that we will not follow him in that humiliation and keep ourselves guarded from every angle to protect ourselves from any loss of our own dignity here i we have to sweat blood and and wring ourselves out to persuade believers to pray
25:29 -  when God has touched something of conviction and they they sit like lumps in their seats and will not open their mouths will not break will not pray their dignity will not allow it and they're making already a private arrangement with God i'll see you i'll see you about this later
25:48 -  and we'll talk about it in the privacy of my bedroom and there i will confess what you're wanting me now to confess publicly and and that private confession which i will do at my leisure and invoke you at my will for my convenience is one to which you will give yourself
26:07 -  how disrespectful to God and how much does it depreciate God as God that we can make a private transaction appropriate to our dignity and will not humble ourselves and cry out and pray in the moment in which he's present and and asks for our response got the idea we're proud and unwilling
26:32 -  and therefore the church suffers and is unreal and unable to communicate to a dying world those redemptive things that would have been known to us and communicated by us had we opened ourselves open ourselves to the work of God in the kind of thing that threatens our dignity
26:53 -  we're unwilling to be humbled got the idea i couldn't see that there must be a reason why every single morning i'm up around four look couldn't you make it six i would still have plenty of time for devotional seeking and preparation and then come to the class
27:13 -  why in this season especially when a man needs his rest am i most deprived so that by the time the class starts at 10 i'm then really beginning to feel the effect of the loss of sleep and lay out all these books not knowing how to begin but to begin in total weakness not knowing
27:35 -  which is a humiliation why because how dare we broach this subject except in the same character and spirit in which the subject itself takes place this is minor this is nothing to be a little hung over for want of rest but it's not an accident got the idea you guys and i believe that the
27:59 -  truest and deepest last days ministries must come out of that impotence and out of that weakness and not out of some flamboyant uh heady ability of our own which contradicts the very spirit and the ethos of the faith as it was given by the first at the first by a suffering and humiliated savior
28:20 -  this is full of implications for us now and especially in the last days but are you willing to be humiliated what happens if you fog up and you can't think of the next sentence and how to proceed and and your long painful silences and all of that stuff well that's a minor note next to
28:42 -  what he suffered so his suffering has that implication and when he says if any man would follow me but take up his cross that's what he's talking about but we are a cross neglecting and a cross rejecting church and it shows pitifully the church has got to come to the jew in the character
29:06 -  and spirit of its own messiah but how has the church come in the rare instances of which it has come if it has come at all superior if you see gothic churches in europe the portal of those cathedrals show a fallen jerusalem with a blindfold on and a broken scepter and humbled humiliated and
29:30 -  the other side is the victorius triumphant church triumphalism has been the note of the church historically toward the jew that that that that that you really missed it but now we take over see so we're not coming at all in the spirit of their own God and little wonder that they have
29:49 -  rejected what what little message we've had to offer there have been forced debates throughout the middle ages where leading rabbis were required to debate erudite priests over the issue of messianic scripture and jews were required to attend and if they fell asleep they were
30:06 -  wrapped on their on their heads there are people walked around with sticks if a jew feigned sleep or fell asleep they wrapped them but they of course they wanted to educate these jews about the truth what made luther anti-semitic the failure of jews to see in the prussian reformation
30:25 -  their messianic faith he could understand that they could reject catholicism but they should reject reformation protestantism which were which for the jew was no more impressive than catholicism and he was so angered by that failure and then his debate with rabbis
30:43 -  and the way in which they misconstrued the messianic prophecies or would not see the evident truth of them that he lashed out with his a book called the lies of the jews which served four centuries later to equip the nazi movement to do what luther commended burn their synagogues
31:03 -  destroy their talmud rob break loot destroy expel because he saw them as a threat to the reformation itself so we have not come to them as we ought but how do we come to them as we would how do we come in to this reality this mode this ethos e-t-h-o-s
31:32 -  because is there anything more offensive than false humility better that we would not make an attempt at it then then we should play at it and miss it as you must unless your humility is authentic how do you obtain that in the school of humiliation and the church and life
31:55 -  in the working of God in being found out and the issues of your own life and family that you don't hide and conceal and and depict yourself as the man of faith and power but but the flesh and blood as of all of God's saints
32:15 -  so one thing about humility it cannot be affected you can't put it on you can only have it in the same and the measure of your union with the God who himself is humbled by nature because you have joined him in the fellowship of his sufferings and in his humiliation
32:34 -  you're the continuation so to speak of what he began in his own suffering and death this natural man does not want to give up the ghost and doesn't want to suffer a crucifixion death and burial he doesn't mind getting baptized so long as it's only getting wet but he has no intention of
32:57 -  remaining buried he wants to continue in a certain self and the natural life which now will improve by virtue of being a christian rather than be extinguished if you're earnest in your walk you don't have to look far for the cross it will be there you don't have to ask
33:18 -  what does it mean you'll know it if you're earnest in your walk if you're not experiencing a suffering because of your identification with christ if you're not brought into places of confrontation and dealing you're shrinking from the cross you have seen to the
33:37 -  protection of your own life in which the issues are avoided but if you're earnest necessarily you will and must come to the cross as experience you don't have to look far to find it you know just as the sacrament of the lord's table has suffered great loss the sacrament of baptism
33:59 -  has equally suffered loss and where is the apostolic exposition of the meaning of water baptism in the book of romans itself the sixth chapter as Paul goes on and i don't know that we're going to go through every chapter and come to that but just now to say
34:14 -  that there's a way that God has provided that we might be joined with him in his crucifixion death and burial that we might be joined with him also unto a resurrection to newness of life God has provided a sacrament a means a mode by which we can obtain the benefit of his death
34:37 -  because we were not to be impaled afresh ourselves there's one death it's the great epochal e-p-o-c-h-a-l event in all history the crucifixion of God himself but we can enter into that reality receive the death of it by the means of baptism
34:58 -  so there's something available to us what God's not asking us to impale ourselves but he is giving us invitation to identify and join him in his very death but if we negate that and make that baptism only a religious requirement by of getting wet then we're as much alive after
35:20 -  we come out of the water as we before we went in so when i have occasion especially to baptize younger people i mock and taunt them and tell them that they're too young to die why are you doing this you're foolish you have a whole life ahead of you you've not even yet begun to live it to
35:39 -  test your talents and your abilities and find your way and fortune why are you wanting to bring down that life into death and if if they can pass through the test of my mocking and taunting and still require it then when i put them in the water i put them into death and burial and keep
35:58 -  them down when they come up they will come up by faith until the news of life and resurrection that's why we see so little resurrection reality because we've seen so little death reality and as john mentioned it's a it's a daily reenactment there's a daily dying and a daily
36:21 -  rising if we're walking in earnestness with the lord so none of that would have any meaning if this had no meaning it only has meaning to the degree that it meant for him a death of his natural man and of which he was the epitome of all that
36:42 -  could be hoped for in humanity he was very man and very God he was a superb piece of humanity what a pity that he had to die he could have gone on people were ready to make him king then but he wouldn't receive it he knew he had to pass through death he's the resurrection and the life
37:03 -  if they if they mourned and wept outside of the tomb of Lazarus because he was too young to die what would they think of the death of Jesus at only the age of 33 why do i regret the passing of spurgeon at the age of 57 or oswald chambers at the age of 38 or for that matter george gershwin
37:24 -  or any of my culture heroes whom i would have loved to have had a longer life why does God take them early i remember praying for a woman in england she said i've had a headache for over 30 years please pray for me i said what happened 30 years ago my father died i said oh
37:47 -  yeah and she said i have never forgiven God that he took him prematurely who are we to say what is premature from our earthly vantage point when God is the giver and taker of life i said you need to ask God's forgiveness for your arrogant attitude toward him that you've not forgiven him as if he
38:11 -  requires your forgiveness for something he in his own sovereignty and wisdom required and which she never thought that no one had ever told her like that she's been prayed for a thousand times since she still retained her headache she prayed as asking God for forgiveness for her proud
38:30 -  assumption that God could be wrong because she wanted her father so much to live a longer life he was evidently a dear man and when she prayed that i prayed for her boom that headache lifted as if it had never existed and she'll not experience it again so what am i saying by all that
38:51 -  the sovereignty of God the issues of death and our own willingness to submit to it so you take inventory what has your water baptism meant for you what did you intend that it should mean and what evidence have you seen consistently of the newness of life
39:11 -  and to which you should have been brought by going down into death and it was not your hangups like i never tire of telling people a baptism is not to crucify your hangups it's to crucify your virtues it's not to crucify you at your in your worst aspect but your best because even your best is
39:29 -  not best enough not good enough it's still men it's still human all too human it's still shot through with sin and ego vanity and pride it can never serve God in a priestly way there'll always be as a self-serving aspect so long as that root remains to which only one axe can be laid that
39:49 -  to which only one axe can be laid that can kill it it's this cross and evidently we've not understood that and therefore we've not received its benefit pity the issue really begins in the garden where Jesus sweated plots of blood i'm very fond of
40:08 -  saying i've said already in these days the first blood was extruded before it was extricated but it was the same blood shut later by the infliction of men but its first setting was extruded by the agony of Jesus in the garden wrestling out the commitment to the father unto death so what began
40:30 -  in the garden in the fall of adam is rectified by the second adam in faithful obedience to the father in suffering for the first adam and all the sons of adam that we might have a newness of life in him but it required that agonizing review of what this cross would would mean and a voluntary
40:59 -  willingness to go upon it because he said don't you know that i could have called for legions of soldiers i didn't have to suffer this but my kingdom is not of this world okay so let's go into the book of romans now
41:19 -  we're not doing a detailed study i'm not even able to lead in it but at your own leisure we're not going to begin with chapter one the salutation Paul is servant of Jesus christ called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of God which he promised beforehand through his
41:39 -  prophets in the holy scriptures the gospel concerning his son which was descended from david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead even Jesus christ that would what a mouthful what an
41:56 -  opening statement i wonder if it stupefied the gentile readers to receive an epistle like that with such a salutation and a greeting if that's the way he began what can be expected as he goes on in the depth and magnitude of his thought but this greeting alone deserves exacting examination
42:17 -  even to the acknowledgement of itself as a slave for the purpose of being set apart for the gospel of God so this great apostle saw the issue of the gospel as the principal reason for his being and that he would be the apostle to the gentiles to communicate this this message
42:38 -  and that it had to do with his son who was descended from david you would think that Paul would have been more politic than that and avoid anything in reference to what is jewish inviting to a gentile church in rome who are already smarting from the contempt of the synagogue
42:58 -  for themselves as gentile believers who profess to claim to have received Israel's messiah this this is so this is the details are enormous if you're if you're if you're to appreciate this epistle
43:16 -  that the church was already in tension and conflict with jews who still retained their synagogue judaism and treated the church with contempt and disdain as a bunch of gentile dum-dums who didn't understand hebrew and misconstrued the scriptures and read it to their
43:35 -  advantage to celebrate a criminal and make him the messiah and even God can you understand that so already they're smarting because jews are to be found in the capital of the greatest empire because their commerce business trade culture is the kind of thing in which we jews flourish
43:53 -  so when he says at the very beginning that this son of God is also the son of david he's like opening a sore wound and allowing even a wave of resentment to come from his readers but that doesn't even stop him in the same chapter a few verses later to say that this gospel
44:12 -  is not in the power of God of the salvation but it's to the jew first and also to the greek so here we have a beautiful picture of what an apostle is who does not withhold the whole council of God even though it will not fall well on the ears of his auditors he's not politic he's not playing
44:33 -  the game he's putting out the truth they need to hear these things because as we'll go on into romans especially 9 through 11 Paul really lays it on the line and says accept that they receive mercy through your mercy they will perish but if God did not hesitate to break them off from their
44:51 -  tree that you might be grafted in is he not able to graft them in again and if you do not hold fast in faith he'll break you off so Paul is already from the very first chapter establishing themes that the roman church which is to say the church in the world to this very day
45:12 -  needs profoundly to consider but you need to appreciate what it means to be apostolic it's not to withhold the truth because it may occasion misunderstanding or resentment it's not to skirt around it and wait for a more opportune moment right from the beginning
45:29 -  Paul begins to lay it out this son of God is also the son of david in the flesh he's jewish you need to be reminded because even today there are christians who for whom that has never struck home they said they they can't conceive that Jesus was a jew and of necessity had to be
45:52 -  to live under the law fulfill the requirements of the law to be a covenant faithful son and fulfill its requirements even in his death so this is the obligation of the apostle to set forth this remarkable
46:08 -  statement and doctrine of a gospel concerning his son who was descended from david according to the flesh and was declared to be the son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection of the dead Jesus christ our lord
46:24 -  so you you dwell on that but we want to go directly to 16 and 17 that sets the whole theme of the book of romans about the gospel as the power of God and the salvation to everyone who has faith
46:42 -  to the jew first and also to the greek for in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith or by faith to faith as it is written the one who is righteous will live by faith what do you make of that it raises the question that we need to consider and have been
47:02 -  considering in the first week of the school how is the righteousness of God revealed by faith in the gospel for in it the righteous righteousness of God is revealed through faith anybody have a glimmer
47:25 -  and if the God if the righteousness of God is not revealed through the gospel how then will it be revealed and how is the gospel the most acute and profound statement of that righteousness the gospel is the story and the account of the sending of God's son
47:47 -  to die and that through his death and the shedding of blood in that death an efficacy is released for the atonement of sin an atonement is obtained and at one minute with God because his ear is not heavy that it cannot hear nor his arm weak that it cannot save but your sins have separated you
48:11 -  from God the gospel is God's provision to end that separation and affect the reconciliation of lost mankind with God through the expiation or the shedding of blood performed by his son as perfect man and God because no lesser sacrifice would have sufficed for which all
48:37 -  previous sacrifice was an anticipation but could not be the once and for all sacrifice performed by very God himself that the God of righteousness who is rightly angry at sin because he's holy himself had to pay the price necessary that justice required to expiate it
49:02 -  or else he would not have been a righteous God if he had you know how jews talk today we don't need blood we ask God forgiveness we get it you ask and you get this blood business is unnecessary out of the construction of their own minds presuming upon God that merely to ask for
49:25 -  forgiveness is to obtain it without anything needful to expiate it they can say that because they have no real consciousness of the exceeding sinfulness of sin that requires more than little glib God forgive me and then you go on with your business sin is of such a thing and that's why
49:45 -  we're going into this we need to understand sin why is God angry with the sin every day why is the wrath of God justified why is the righteous God offended what is sin that this was required to expiate it and not just forgive me and then go on got the idea we have no message
50:07 -  for the jew until we ourselves have understood and received it seeing the magnitude of our own sin maybe that's why david had to commit both adultery and murder that if the sweet singer of Israel and the king of Israel the author of psalms could fall into so hideous a condition
50:29 -  which of us is except and not capable of that very conduct why is are not our sins like his ever before us do we have to commit it to prove that we share the same nature with david that if a david could fall we also not only can but have to me this this is
50:55 -  what is in my craw this is the thing that's in my inner man that needs to be worked out and expressed and understood and and received or else how shall we praise God what kind of worship are we capable if we have not deeply received this benevolence if we're only shallowly saved we'll
51:21 -  only shallowly praise we'll only shallowly worship and that in fact is the truth about present conditioning i will only shallowly witness it's righteous of God to give himself for the sins of the world because no other provision would have been sufficient
51:38 -  that's that's that's righteous of God to do and how was it done through suffering through sacrifice that's righteous so we're wanting a definition of righteousness any aspect of holding this to the light it reveals it Jesus revealed righteousness
51:58 -  in the bearing of the cross and voluntarily that's the righteousness of God or else we're stuck with abstract definitions that do not suffice this is the depiction of righteousness this saves us from abstract mental contemplations this is righteousness what was done on that cross
52:23 -  is righteousness it's the righteousness of God that will not let sin pass without an appropriate recompense or else how would it be righteous if he looks the other way as if sin is not a factor and he can take it or leave it and humors you and so that you can go on in it again if you choose
52:41 -  he's got to express his righteous indignation at what sin is because sin as we will read the last analysis is a direct affront to God is a willful conduct on the part of man against God in attitude and in conduct it's full of disrespect and contempt God says thou shall not
53:04 -  and nevertheless we do how can God ignore that and still retain his own Godliness and be an object for the worship and the consideration of mankind to save it from itself you
