The Prophetic Call

00:00 -  Lord, hear from heaven and give answer. Watch over, my God, your own interests with a great jealousy this morning. Let nothing be lost, nothing, either by the operation of the enemy or the operation of
00:21 -  the flesh. We ask, my God, for your brooding watch care over us, that that jealousy will be felt, my God, and experienced in our own hearts.
00:36 -  Someone mentioned this morning, Lord, about that Gentile widow who came to you and you said that it's not meat, that she should have meat from the table for the children of Israel. She said, what about the crumbs that fall to the dogs?
00:52 -  You could not gainsay her, Lord, with a heart like that. So we ask, Lord, that we would be as mindful of the crumbs as she. So give us a sense, Lord, that this is not academic or just something for our curiosity,
01:10 -  that there might be a life and death consequence based on how we hear, that there might be a consequence, something set in motion in our own character, our own faithfulness, our own obedience.
01:22 -  When something will be required of us, my God, when eternity hangs at the balance, that would have been affected by something that was spoken today. So we bless your name and we call upon your name, asking mercy, Lord, thanking you for
01:35 -  your constant love and the ministry of your spirit. What shall we say, Lord? Without your spirit, without your anointing, we might as well pack up.
01:47 -  But with your anointing, Lord, nothing can withstand that penetration. And we ask it again this morning. We acknowledge, Lord, with dull of hearing and indolent and lazy and cowardly and all
02:01 -  the other kinds of things, Lord, that that in here, in men, but we ask that you would divinely possess us and be made, Lord, everything unto us, that you might receive all the praise and the glory and the honor, in Jesus' name, now bless this time and make it rich and full
02:21 -  to your own delight, amen. Well, we mentioned something yesterday in passing about the controversy that has been brewing over the word prophet and prophets, that there's a recent phenomenon taking place,
02:41 -  I think, of interest worldwide of the sudden attention to the prophetic calling. And some remarkable things to note is the popularity now of that calling and people tripping off with the light and glee to pack out churches to hear men who have been called
03:03 -  prophets and oracles and all the rest. And I think it's a phenomenon that we need to attend with great care. We're told in the last days that there would be false prophets, false apostles.
03:20 -  One of the churches in the book of Revelation is congratulated by the Lord for discerning the false apostles, those who say that they are apostles and are not. So this is a remarkable phenomenon.
03:35 -  And I don't think that I'm prepared to be on record to say that what is being so popular today is false, but I have my suspicions and I certainly have my concerns. What I want to read to you is a letter that I wrote to a very precious brother missionary
03:52 -  in Japan. We have sat together in a number of prophetic conferences with these men or listening to these men, and he takes a much more, what's the word, kindly view than I and has written
04:05 -  a little booklet about them. And I'm writing to him after having read his booklet and making certain points and comments that I think would be of interest to you.
04:16 -  And then if we get through that this morning, I was challenged to sum up what I think has to do with the prophetic calling. What distinguishes true prophets?
04:29 -  And I wrote, it came out to be 12 statements, interesting number, and I think it's worth hearing. It's not a finished statement.
04:38 -  It's not a polished statement. It's very crude. It's right off the top of my head, but it certainly ought to fuel our fire.
04:44 -  It'll give us something to dig our teeth into and to inspect. I just want to say that before I begin this, I was really delighted for yesterday morning in the interplay between us over the subject under discussion.
04:58 -  This is exactly what I was hoping that the school would be, namely, not just one person lecturing or ruminating, but an interplay between the students, teacher, that we're all in this together.
05:12 -  You can't tell where the one ends, the other begins, and we're digging into something and drawing something out. So if you think back on how yesterday morning unfolded, it was just a precious bringing
05:26 -  forth through this one and through that, and I just want to encourage you all to continue in that. It's kind of ironic.
05:32 -  Now that we're hitting our stride, it's just about finished, and we're to God that we had another five weeks now that we're coming into a place of really kind of flowing and moving through this material in a good way that it has to end.
05:47 -  But not the least of the benefit would be to give us a taste of what God is wanting in the church. I think I mentioned before theology is too good merely to be the exclusive province of
06:01 -  theologians. It's the church's inheritance, and the people of God need to be drawn in to theological discussion and the examination of the issues of the faith, and most church people are bored
06:16 -  or listless and nothing much is required of them but passively to sit if we can somehow create an environment of the kind that we have been enjoying where God's people could sit like this with their Bibles out in notebooks and be involved in a kind of interaction over
06:32 -  significant subjects, we would see real growth and maturity coming to the people of God. Okay, any comment before I start? It's a letter to Carlton, Dear Carlton, I've just finished my first reading of your excellent
06:50 -  Standing in the Council of God, that's the name he gave his little book, passed on to me by a brother, evidently it springs from your concerns over the phenomena of our present day prophets which is also a matter of my own concern, may I think aloud and interact
07:06 -  with you over some statements in your very thoughtful work, certainly if the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, we cannot be careful enough in the consideration of this subject, feel free to interrupt me at any moment, raise
07:20 -  your hand, make a comment, and I just want to enlarge and underline myself some of the things that are being said, the church is built on the foundation of the prophets and the apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, and my jealousy over apostles
07:36 -  and prophets stems from this, if there's something flaky about apostles and prophets, what will be the superstructure based on that foundation, the superstructure cannot exceed the foundation, therefore the foundation deserves the most exceeding attention, so this has
07:58 -  been my long standing passion and jealousy, kind of a watchdog over these words that they should not be used indiscriminately nor likely which is in fact exactly what is happening today, these words are becoming a commonplace and I'm amazed at the naivety and ignorance
08:16 -  of the use of the words, so bad that people can't even distinguish between the gift of prophecy and the office of prophet, and I can't think of more fundamental confusion that would destroy the foundation of the church than this one thing alone, that it's like
08:33 -  a white brush like that or a brush that's parring everything or painting everything in the same color, the office of prophet is so holy, the holy prophets of old, the gift of prophecy is something else, that could be exercised as the spirit will through any
08:51 -  believer that does not make them a prophet, but I'm afraid that what is happening as I may have a point here in this paper to say is that people are not making that distinction, we need to make distinctions, we need to discriminate, we need to discern, and this is what the
09:07 -  church is, and it's an embarrassment that our scandals need to be examined and reviewed and critiqued by secular journalists, the kinds of things that we ought to have been doing would have avoided and prevented the scandal, but when the scandal comes even then
09:27 -  we're so dull in our ability to discern and to critique we have to wait for a journalist in the world to do it and to lay bare what is the root of the problem of the Jimmy Swaggots and the Jimmy Bakers, which is an indictment against the whole church that has so supported
09:41 -  men whose lifestyles is so contrary to the whole ethos of the New Testament scriptures, we're a bunch of dumb-dumbs and we've not been required to think and to critique and to be careful about our words and our terms, to examine the phenomena of our time and to
09:58 -  understand them, we just kind of go along with whatever the fad is, whatever the movement, whatever is currently in vogue, so we cannot be careful enough in the consideration of this subject, you have really put your finger on the key question, do our prophets prophesy
10:15 -  out of their own hearts and spirits or draw from each other or come to us out of the secret place, the thing that distinguishes the true prophet is where he gets his counsel, the when he says thus saith the Lord, is it a convention, is it a kind of punctuation that
10:38 -  is appropriate or is it a statement of the fact that what he's speaking has come out of the secret place of God or has it come out of his own rumination, his own imagination or is he hearing it from others, there's a remarkable amount of imitation and counterfeit
10:54 -  and we who have been around long enough have seen this kind of thing take place in other ways and I mentioned male imitations of Catherine Coleman, that her manner and her ministry after her death was emulated by many, even their voice and hoping that people would be
11:13 -  slain in the spirit and they would take up her mantle, I mean just another one that is very imitatable is the brother in L.A. from the Four Square Church, Jack Hayford, who he has a very distinct manner of speaking, he holds his arms over his chest and holds
11:34 -  his chin and he makes his points like that, a certain inflection of his voice then he will turn to the congregation and I was astonished as I traveled to find how many Jack Hayford imitations I was encountering and so if that can go on even in a mindless way, how much
11:50 -  more than will men who purport to be prophets imitate one another, catch what is presently popular and give themselves to it and be assured both of an audience and a hearing? Do they come to us out of the secret place? I could not agree more that, quote, if men do claim
12:14 -  to be commissioned we have a right to look for evidence that they indeed have stood in that place, unquote. My point of difference with you might be that the evidence is not so much the issue of the accuracy of their predictions but the credibility, cogency and
12:29 -  power of their message. In my opinion a prophet is first and foremost an inspired preacher and it is here more than any other criteria that I am most disappointed because he makes this point in his book, he says are these men true prophets or not and the issue, the
12:47 -  criterion that he uses is the accuracy of their predictions and whether I say it here or not, I will say it now, to me that is not the issue. The issue of prediction isn't for me even the issue of a prophet. For me the issue of the kind of prophet that we need
13:06 -  and I go on to develop in this letter that the church so desperately needs in the last days is not one who is going to be accurate to tell you your name and your middle initial and that you are suffering from arthritis or inflamed gums but a prophet who will give
13:18 -  us the oracles of God and say what this hour means and what it is to which we are pending and what is God requiring in the light of the things that point to the consummation of the age. We need men who bring the word, the inspired preacher, a prophet is eminently
13:35 -  first and foremost before any other capacity an inspired preacher. That doesn't mean that every inspired preacher is a prophet but if a prophet is not distinguished by his speaking don't look for his credentials on the basis of his gifting or his miracles or his gift
13:55 -  of knowledge or any of that. That could be a real snare. So my point of difference with you might be that the evidence is not so much the issue of the accuracy of their predictions but the credibility, cogency and power of their message. A prophet is first and foremost
14:15 -  an inspired preacher and it is in this criterion that I am most disappointed. It is not that the messages have not been biblical and good so much as that they have not been oracular that is prophetic in the sense of the weight, intensity and solemnity of the messages. Are
14:33 -  you understanding what I am saying? I have watched and attended many of these conferences in fact when out of my way to go to a most recent one just before our own school began and to see and hear again the man most reported to be the oracle of the hour and just like
14:49 -  every previous time that I have heard him. Now maybe there are other times when I have not that indeed he has come through in the way that I suspect a prophet should but every time I have heard him he has always been faithful in preaching a biblical word but it has not
15:04 -  been a prophetic word. Do you understand that? That a word can be sound, biblical, doctrinally clean and yet not be a prophetic word. It does not have the weight. It does not have the meaning. It does not have the portent that a prophetic word should and for people
15:24 -  who are not inducted in that understanding do not expect it, do not look for it and what they are really after is to wait for the message to finish so he can then embark on the thing for which they have really come namely the exciting exercise of his gift, the gift of
15:40 -  knowledge and what he can say about you and the healing or the benefit that might come from that. Maybe I am the one that will be called and you know that kind of thing. So we are moving into the dangers of the last days and I believe that it is the giddy love
16:00 -  for the demonstration of power and some kind of gifting that will seduce millions of God's people who are not too careful to examine the nexus or the origin of that manifestation so long as they themselves might be the happy recipient of a word of knowledge about them.
16:20 -  Why do God's people need that so much? Because I believe they have a deep seeded insecurity in faith. They have not the knowledge of God or themselves in God. They do not see themselves as accepted in the beloved and they want the confirmation that God really knows them. Look
16:40 -  he has called me by name or he knows my circumstance. It is a relief to know that God knows you. But you need to have that kind of testimony to have that assurance. Evidently great numbers of God's people do. They are insecure in their faith so all of the factors are there that
16:59 -  would move us toward deception. The insecurity of believers who are not grounded in a true apostolic faith, very quick to respond to any kind of sign or power demonstration that might attest to them that God sees them and knows them and men who have been promoted
17:17 -  to reputation and popularity on that basis and it is called prophetic. I wouldn't mind so much. I wouldn't mind. The great guardian of the faith. What would God do without me? But I wouldn't mind so much if that went on if it did not purport to be prophetic. But
17:35 -  once they invoke that word they have a fight coming. If you come through that portal be aware that when you invoke that word you better not be doing something sleazy under that banner where you discredit the word and its meaning and do violence to the foundation
17:55 -  of the church itself. This much is sure even if it is not a dangerous thing that will ultimately promote deception which I believe it will it certainly does not promote maturity whereas a prophetic word will. A prophetic word requires something. We are going to go into that in
18:11 -  these days but the kind of messages that these men are bringing is not that kind of requirement. It is just a preliminary prior to the exercise of the gift for which I believe people have really come and I have other things that I can share with you depending on your ability
18:25 -  to take it and your desire of two messages that have been transcribed that I gave years ago at Camp Dominion on the prophetic calling and I just flipped it over. It was only recently transcribed and it is full of anecdotal references out of my own experience of crisis of confrontation
18:46 -  of the kind of word that God gives in a moment that is totally not only requiring but of such a kind that people are ready to stone you in the hearing of it. So I am willing to give it to you. I want to give everything. Let the Lord ring me out in the rich experience
19:01 -  that I have had over the years so long as you know that not anything that is being read that has to do with my experience is in any way an opportunity for me to enjoy something egotistical or vain. I would be just as happy if it were another man's experience that we
19:18 -  would have the benefit of learning from it but it just so happens it is mine and I have it before me and I suspect that that is not the least of the reasons why the Lord is having us to have the school and I always felt that there is a volume of things that God has given,
19:31 -  a depth of experience, a measure of insight and it would be a pity to take that to my grave and not to have made it available to those who have like calling and there is a way to learn from that by which you need not necessarily have to pass through the experience
19:45 -  itself if you can appropriate it vicariously in the hearing which is not the least reason when the scriptures themselves are given so tighten the seat belt and if you can take it this will we're moving toward a conclusion but the Lord is going to really give us an intensity
20:03 -  and a volume of things right to the end it may take you weeks to sort it out after you leave but I want it on record on tape and that it has been sounded in your hearing so we're going to take that up in some detail so I'm talking now about the critical thing that distinguishes the
20:23 -  prophet is his message and it's more than just a sound biblical doctrine speaker speaking prophetic speaking has a distinctive character it's a message of a particular kind and I write it's not that the messages have not been biblical and good so much as that they have not been
20:42 -  maybe we'll need to make a study of that word the oracles of God that is to say prophetic in the sense of the weight the intensity the solemnity of them doesn't mean you have to that you're preaching for the long face but it's there's a heft to the word there's a weight and a sense of
21:01 -  requirement of penetration that is not to be found in other kinds of utterance true my sampling has not been extensive but I have not been struck by so much as any of those whom I've heard and indeed the last time was marked by a painful levity and unbecoming lightness after we were
21:21 -  informed that we were to hear the article of God for the hour this is an interesting thing that the conference that was conducted here in Minneapolis was marked by levity and lightness it was just a casual air about the whole thing like like a weekend frolic you know
21:43 -  ain't we got fun it was not the seriousness I hope I'm not being romantic but I think that there's an atmosphere appropriate to a prophetic speaking and hearing that was not in the in those days but it's like people after hearing the word they can get up and move around and joke and carry
22:03 -  on as if nothing had happened that's a disturbing symptom that nothing did happen please understand that the issue is not personal peak or disappointment p i q u e but that the prophetic standard which is in a certain way the statement of God before his
22:22 -  people not only is his fear not communicated neither his holiness in a real and searching sense but we are likely to suffer a distorted view of God understand that how much is involved when something is being labeled as prophetic and it's not it's not only that the prophetic
22:41 -  calling itself is being questioned and denigrated but God is being denigrated because he himself is so intrinsic to the thing that is prophetic and I'll say that and admit that I don't understand what that scripture means that says that that the how is it the testimony of Jesus is the
22:59 -  spirit of prophecy I don't understand it but I know it's a holy statement that somehow there's an intrinsic link between himself and what is prophetic that needs to be recognized and to treat the prophetic thing likely is to treat him likely it's not only the prophetic thing that
23:17 -  suffers in esteem he suffers in esteem the whole issue of God himself is at stake when there's a likeness and a levity in an environment in which the oracle of the hour is being supposedly proclaimed God suffers loss and he suffers it in the understanding and the hearts of his people
23:37 -  even though they may be unconscious that there is that loss it is taking place I think the greater issue is not so much as whether these prophets are accurate most of the time so much as whether they are prophets at all for him the issue was have they been accurate
24:02 -  more times than that and Mike Bickel has publicly announced and he's very much involved with the whole circle of of these prophets is that it's unfair for you to think that a prophet needs to be right on every time it's not the issue of batting 100% if you bat 70% 72% that's real good you know
24:26 -  it's like three out of four times you're it's right now don't don't be too demanding you know and make room for these men after all they're still in the last analysis of men but you know isn't it so American to predicate the issue of something being true on the basis of statistic
24:44 -  and the summing up and the arithmetic of it rather than the substantial inner quality of the thing that distinguishes it as being prophet can we recognize something that's authentically prophetic when it chokes and splutters and it's awkward and and trips all over itself and you know if we have
25:06 -  a statistical mentality that's American that measures by the proportion of of how much of it works the utilitarian mindset it'll it'll reassures that will not be a position to discern what is prophetically true something that's statistical is a matter of mind but the thing
25:28 -  that is of discernment is the matter of heart you know and so it's even putting us on a kind of false basis to determine true and false among prophets if it's moved us from heart discernment to mathematical discernment in terms of what is the average of people being led to God or from him
25:47 -  it may seem that a God is being celebrated but is it God in fact or a God which is the projection of our own kind of charismatic desire as a God who does not require a God who goes along we can we can label that God Jesus but that doesn't make him so does does does the some effect of
26:08 -  this ministry called prophetic lead us to the God who is God in fact and in truth and in spirit I think that the greater issue is not so much as whether these prophets are accurate most of the time so much as whether they are whether they are prophets at all to confirm the church in its own
26:24 -  present likeness by their own example is analogous to the false prophets of all testament time who confirmed Israel in its sin all in all what is their revelation how oracular is it what is it more or other than the general preaching of others who make no profession
26:42 -  of being prophets is their distinctive not much more the sensationalism or excitement of their gifts or the anticipation derived from the hero status generated largely by the by their affirmation of each other or the present fat of the church in search of relief from its apparent dryness or
27:01 -  some combination of the above that's a whole mouthful you know a church that's dry and recognizes or intuits that something is lacking is in a special candidate for deception to grasp the first thing that offers it relief and seems to bring a quotient of excitement and just as the
27:22 -  student of the church for this little more than quarter of a century i've seen the church go from fad to fad novelty to novelty gimmick to gimmick it's as if we're looking for something we know that there's something going to miss something's out of the way the church is wanting there's a
27:37 -  grayness in fact last year's conference was entitled the melees of the church the inherent sickness which makes the church a candidate to grasp at any sort of flaws a very dangerous kind of condition and to keep missing the kind of thing that God calculated for the church's health
27:55 -  better to suffer the dryness and wait for the true answer when it comes in God's time in God's way then for yourself to kindle the sparks or to reach out for any fad that's presently current and i don't want to take now the issues of how valid church growth is our evangelism what if
28:14 -  who would be the which names would be associated with this peter wagner of fuller theological seminary that has just recently established a david duplicy library first time that a fundamental evangelical
28:32 -  school has celebrated a pentecostal and somehow my spirit is not leaping over that but i something's rotten in denmark i don't know what this marriage means but it's not but it doesn't ring true in my spirit ecumenical right so that's church growth
28:55 -  and if you'll hear me out when i read you the prophetic calling in my own experiences i have actually been on the platform with peter wagner in an annual conference of a pentecostal denomination leave it to the lord and what we represented was so totally opposite we were such polarities
29:15 -  and this whole movement was virtually at the point of being seduced to find an answer to its own ills in the statistical methodological thing that he was offering them it's a whole thing worked out through computers and study guides and lists and how to speak and do and
29:33 -  perform and establish and guarantee increase numerically in your congregation and when the lord pulled the string at the end of those days men went down like dead the president of the of the movement and the school in which the conference was being conducted
29:49 -  was waken three o'clock in the morning by God and convicted and he said this this trouble of Israel is the man that i have sent and man came to me broken that morning the lord brought a spirit of repentance because i cried out to them to find the answer to their dryness not as a methodological
30:09 -  technique now being elaborated but where their fathers founded at the first namely on their faces in the sawdust and this man came and confessed before the entire school the president of the school he said i've never had a baptism in the holy spirit head of the pentecostal school
30:24 -  and things like that so we're not touching small things here and God give us the right spirit lord watch over my mouth my i you know when you start to talk about these things you're you're walking over a tightrope i could tell you things that i had been privy to
30:41 -  that you would clap your hand over your mouth but i'm not at liberty to tell you all those things and what measure i do tell you has got to be spoken in the very best and right spirit it's such a delicate thing it's fraught with danger for the church the true apostolic remnant reality
30:58 -  of God so we do need to be able to critique these phenomena but we need to keep our spirits guarded at the same time because i'm a man who has passed through it all i know them all i was catherine coolman coolman's darling for a short season but the whole promotion of my ministry came
31:18 -  through her national telecasts and that came because of an anointed five-minute testimony that i gave at a chicago full gospel conference when i was just the youngest of believers so i've known them i know them by name i know them personally i've been in intimate places that
31:34 -  lord has given me glimpses and discernments enough to alert me and to to keep me at that place of concern but i don't want to use it in a way that it can be used as denigrating and and condemning and and exalting yourself we are it we're at the cutting edge we are the true apostolic
31:56 -  and prophetic entity these are the flaky guys if not babalon itself so we need to have something of the spirit of david as we're touching something of a sensitive kind who could not bring himself to stretch his arm out against the anointed of of the lord even though he's a defunct king and
32:13 -  opposed to the true choice of God and was out to kill him but cut the hem of his garment and even that touched his sensitive conscience and offended him so let let us be kept by that kind of spirit and not latch into something that could be dangerous that would do more danger in critiquing
32:36 -  and correcting than if we have not attempted it and maybe this is what this has waited on a prophetical school of a kind that can examine the phenomena of its own generation that is called prophetical and yet not do it in a way that would offend the lord or in a sense even touches anointed
33:00 -  even if they are presently defunct you know in that anointing this this is a critical question about our own promotion so to speak i don't think that david would have been king if he had that day done violence to solomon it was the final test of his davidic art that would assure a kingdom
33:22 -  of bearing a particular character and that issue is our issue also if we air in this we disqualify ourselves from the kind of authentic thing that that we think that God has called us likewise my concern for the reference to angels is not so much that this is invalid in the
33:45 -  experience of saints and ministers as that it becomes an authorization or validating it's interesting that many of these newer prophets have testimonies that make great reference to angels angels told them this or angels were present at this and in fact angels are even
34:02 -  present while they're ministering to indeed tell them the name of a person in the congregation or the need of a something like that and that causes me a certain caution in my own spirit and so what i'm saying is it's not that i'm invalidating angels i love angels and
34:22 -  i'm grateful for angels but i'm a little suspicious when angels are invoked to validate the ministry as being prophetic in other words the ministry what to validate itself and if angels are indeed employed they should not be invoked or referred to in order to win the credibility
34:41 -  and the acceptance of God's people you understand so if we have angelic experiences keep it to yourself but to invoke it in order to win adherence is an employment that causes me a little flutter in my spirit we need to get back to this old testament new testament prophet
35:01 -  out of a dispensational mentality as if there's not a prophetic continuum that is the same in every generation this is what i believe and it doesn't end with one and begin with another i know there are new testament prophets like agabus but the kind of prophet that i think
35:22 -  is a continuum in the redemption history of the faith the house is shift remember that german word is the kind that i'm speaking about here the oracular kind whose word distinguishes his calling in fact the question i want to raise is if you'll not accept angelic
35:45 -  validation for the prophetic ministry what is this validation what would you look for what would you look for that would be a validation of authentic prophetic ministry and i'm saying when the men will invoke angels when their message fails to validate them so we need to be alive to the
36:05 -  message and will you will you have that kind of discernment supposing it's biblical as every message that i've heard from them is would that satisfy you is a biblical message in and of itself necessarily the same as being a prophetic message and that's why we're going
36:21 -  to get into proclamation because if the church needs anything it needs this and if we satisfy ourselves with something less i can't think of a more pitiful thing for the church if the church needs anything in the hour and the hour at which we were deeply
36:41 -  coming it needs really indeed to be an oracular word from the lord for a generation that has invited disaster by our frequent use of that phrase and God said and God said and God said i mean if anything has discredited God it's that frequency i'll give you one instance that
36:59 -  loops immediately to mind i was in europe there was a full gospel breakfast and i think it was a scandinavian minister replete and in the most showy kind of wardrobe i don't know why that seems so often to go together and he and he said the lord has given me a word this morning and why i
37:17 -  leave for it and the moment he opened his mouth and he began to give it just my whole spirit sang because it wasn't the word at all it was a commonplace it was a cheap he was a collection of of cliches and and the references but it was not the word God had not given him but he said God
37:37 -  gave him in order to win the attention of the people i mean that meets the strike of hearts that is so horrendous that is so much the employment of God that's a prostitution of the faith that is taking God's name in vain and the remarkable thing is such men are celebrated
37:55 -  and they then the amens ring throughout the room and nobody seems to recognize that we're just getting a hodgepodge and a mishmash of cliches and it's not the utterance the rama of God at all why can't they recognize it because as i'm going to show today and tomorrow somewhere along the
38:12 -  lines the sitting in the in the healing of a word that is not the word and affirming it as the word is not just missing out on something or not gaining something but it becomes a losing of something that is to say a dulling of the spirit a dulling of the ability to discern
38:33 -  until finally you become in a condition where anything goes you're not and you say amen to anything and you've lost all capacity to discriminate so this is you know very touchy you can't sit in the hearing of something that purports to be what God said and it is not that
38:53 -  and you for you to say amen well i'll even go further for you not to rise to your feet and cry out and blow the whistle and stop that farce means that you're giving yourself to it and suffering and erosion in your spirit thereby and how many of us have remained silent we felt well
39:12 -  something's wrong with us everybody else is having a ball and they're all amening and somehow we're unable to must be something wrong with us when the fact of the matter is it was something right in us and this terrible thing has been going on for a long time and bringing the church to its present
39:30 -  pathetic condition we've we've ascended too long at the statement and God said after this one who will stand and draw the sword and ruin a meeting he'll he'll not be silent he cannot contain himself he cannot allow such a violation of God to take place and that he should remain silent
39:49 -  in fact God has him in that place to puncture that balloon and of course what is he going to bring on his own head he's a art thou he who troubled Israel you ruined the good full gospel breakfast people were enjoying it and your question your comment your standing you know
40:06 -  ruined the whole morning so it's a good it's a great question what do we do nothing more disastrous than to be the self-appointed prophet who thinks that he's bringing the divine correction but i would say that when the divine correction is to be brought and you withhold yourself from
40:25 -  bringing it you become disqualified for future and further use and maybe the discernments of God are afforded to those men who would bring it if God had required it but but we're not answering john's question because john's not asking what happens if a meeting turns out that we're like a
40:42 -  full gospel breakfast john is saying what happens if the whole church and its ministry is like that continually whereas a kind of off being offered as a thus saith the lord but it's a weekly offering of paia cliches what do you do then somebody want to respond to that what if it what if the
41:00 -  conditions in your church and not just a passing full gospel breakfast goes without saying and it's implied that you don't even go to the leadership let alone stand up as God's man of the moment without tremendous preparation and prayer make sure that you're not moving in your own
41:20 -  self-appointed thing here's a thought that comes to mind that must be expressed instead of thinking in terms of individual corrections for individual cases what we need more largely to occupy ourselves with is the quality of the church at large the whole level
41:37 -  of the church in its faith its quality in its word and its proclamation and its expectation needs to be elevated so instead of putting whole fingers in the dikes where the water is already gushing through and trying to stem up the leaks what we need to do is to concern ourselves with
41:54 -  the whole foundation and and raise the church up at large in a solid place and not give ourselves the fighting pockets of of this and that and the other or we might it's something like the issue of being involved in demon deliverances there's no end of them but you never get to the place where
42:13 -  you deal with the principalities and the powers of the air so here we were so occupied with individual corrections they were missing the larger question namely the character the stature of the church its ministries its word its proclamation its faith and to give ourselves
42:30 -  to that larger thing and try to raise the whole church up so that men will not be able to function in that you know the atmosphere would not be permissible it would not permit a fluky word you could not get by with theatrics the people of God have come to a place of maturity where
42:48 -  they would instantly be turned off and you would sense it a man whose ministry is like that would not be comfortable he'd be compelled to to rise to meet the level of true expectancy of his people for a word they come with that expectation they're not coming for a pat religious performance
43:06 -  so we need to address ourselves to the whole church and the lifting up of that quality and not that we're fighting skirmishes we're all going to and have been faced by situations of that kind where we're not sure what we ought to do and it's a remarkable kind of suffering to be in that
43:25 -  predicament and in that tension and then even after the moment passes we're still assaulted by the thoughts of perhaps having missed the moment when we should have done something and we didn't that is a suffering but i want to tell you that that suffering is at the
43:40 -  heart of the church there's a suffering that remains to be filled up in the body and people always think it's a suffering that comes through persecution or that kind of thing but i think it's more likely this this kind of suffering is inevitable it's frequent and we have long
43:56 -  borne it many of us all of us in this room have agonized over the condition of the church our guts have been knotted while we've sat in meetings where people are having a ball with the amens and hallowed years and something in our we're doubled overs if someone hit us in the
44:13 -  what do you call it the solar plexus and and we can't our minds can't even understand it or we watched the moment pass when should we have said something or shouldn't we so i just want to say that that comes under the the title of suffering for his namesake and the lord knew
44:29 -  it there's a certain inevitability about it a certain tension of not knowing and you do the best in the light that you have but you'll always until the day of the lord wonder if you did rightly you went too far you didn't go far enough and i just say bear that suffering and the lord honors
44:45 -  that and i think that's what remains that needs to be filled up it may not be the whole of the suffering but it's a great deal of it and people who are going to feel it most acutely are those who take the lord seriously and are concerned for a jealousy for his church for unto him be
45:01 -  glory in the church and not disgrace but don't think you're alone in that we we're all suffering the church in its present condition and maybe the redemptive answer when it comes comes out of the willingness to bear that suffering as being part of the faith so let's i have to say that to that
45:20 -  just to take a look at it's the issue of God's word that somehow prophetic word is ponderous we know when we hear it it makes a particular demand upon our attention and likewise a requirement in our obedience i'm again saying this is not some finished statement that i've reviewed and
45:43 -  critiqued and worked out and finally made it it's just a off the top of my head reaction to a brother's book these these statements need to be more carefully worked out and i'm just thinking aloud that's what i said at the beginning i'm thinking aloud to you in this letter what kind
45:59 -  of a word is prophetic a word that makes a particular demand upon our attention and likewise a requirement in our obedience that kind of word as you rightly note i'm saying to this brother can only come out of the council of God my concern is at the basing of the church a decline in the
46:19 -  value and valuing of the word when that which is not out of this council is announced as being the prophetic word then i talk about the prophet whose sin was publicly identified he's now even presently i think under discipline doesn't matter that we know his name you probably would know if
46:41 -  i mentioned it and i speak about that certainly such failures do not have the origin in a moment out of what formative relationships in the body have these prophets come their public prominence has been sudden i wonder if there was an appropriate nurturing not only
47:00 -  of the gift but of the character of the men before they were visited on the body how long and rightly have they been part of a local body have they been sent out by the same or have we been witnessing a score of celebrities who obtain verification through each other
47:16 -  and are received too eagerly by a church wanting to be relieved of its power p-a-double-l-o-r of its grayness you want to if you kept do you want me to read that again i'm raising the questions one of these prominent prophets fell into sin and has been censured and dealt with but does that
47:37 -  really take care of the matter i'm raising the question of the the the sin and the failure as not having its origin in a moment out of what formative relationships have these prophets come where do they come from before they made their sudden appearance their public prominence has
47:56 -  been sudden i wonder if there has been an appropriate nurturing not only of the gift which seems to be our sole attention but the character of the men before they were visited on the body how long and rightly have they been part of a local body have they been sent out by
48:13 -  the same or have we been witnessing a score of celebrities who have obtained verification through each other what does it say in the scripture about the prophets prophesied falsely and the priest bear rule by their means it's like a self-validating thing that can take place
48:32 -  where the one applauds affirms and establishes the other but it's not a body that has validated them they've not risen up out of the organic nexus through the work of God itself like antioch they've just appeared on the scene and have validated themselves usually by the tribute
48:53 -  and the compliments of other men who are flowing in much the same thing i may mention this next paragraph talking about validating each other that we ourselves he and i this is brother from omni we recently together at a new testament church conference and remarking about the low
49:09 -  standard of truth that prevailed at that conference although the movement and represents itself as being at the highest expression of new testament church life i was surprised at the hype and boosting of each other the frequent reiterations of the presence of anointing and power of God
49:28 -  that seemed to me rather sadly absent the same environment where men celebrate each other and applaud each other was remarkably noted for the absence of anointing it was a painful absence you got me to hurt you and yet the word anointing and isn't this a wonderful time and hasn't God
49:47 -  been really with us and haven't we felt this power and if the speaker the next speaker that comes on would say something about the anointed speaking of the previous speaker when there really wasn't any anointing that can even be discerned so that there seems to be a configuration of things
50:02 -  that once you come to a place where you can lightly applaud one another so as to affirm that it's only a small step from there to begin to presume upon God and the spirit and the anointing and from there once you've taken that liberty you're virtually at the threshold they're not
50:19 -  already into the place of deception when you can say there's anointing when there's no anointing and you can say God was powerfully present when the the nearest child would have said where and you are a minister and the minister of responsibility in a movement and saying this to an audience of
50:36 -  ministers my God we've reached a point where the church is in very serious trouble and it's stems out of that same thing that where men are required to establish themselves by being validated by other men so is out of these burdens provoked by your paper that these remarks come a thinking
50:56 -  aloud as i've said and the ventilation of what has been brewing in my spirit over these past months i include a statement i composed yesterday as some thoughts were defining the prophet and his task though i yet i yet owe you a response to your kind letter about my position on Israel i would
51:11 -  be happy for some feedback in this most sincerely and appreciably your brother and him so we'll take a break now when we come back i'll read this other thing about some comments or statement of what may define a prophet and his task and leave this first thing as just opening up a whole subject
51:33 -  for us and also to say this isn't it good to have correspondence i mean shouldn't we do this more often if we read something from a brother hear something from a brother to take up the issue with them and to examine something i have to say for this brother he answered my letter fastidiously
51:51 -  and maybe in fact if we have time i'll bring you his answer and see how he has responded to it because there's something so encouraging in men from japan to minnesota in an exchange of correspondence over a theme of great concern for the church in this hour and bringing something to
52:07 -  light by ironing sharpening iron comparing scripture it's a wonderful thing we would have much more of it so let's just thank the lord for this portion so precious God we thank you we know we're walking on a delicate ground my God and we ask you to put our one foot before the other
52:27 -  to be watchful over our spirits my God that we don't in any way offend against you or your servants lord so far as we know our hearts my God we desire an honest examination and a critiquing because we're jealous for your name and for your glory and for your honor and the church alone for
52:46 -  whom that glory will come help us lord if in any way we have already erred in any comment in any thought and in anything in our hearts we ask your forgiveness keep us under your blood and help us my God through this time and into the deeper questions not what men are doing but what
53:04 -  which more rightly defines what is prophetic for we know my God that the whole future of the church rests on this being rightly established as foundation bless us now and i'll break and guide our conversation even in it and bring this back my God for such continuation as it
53:21 -  shall please you in Jesus name amen got it on the top of the sheet on the prophetic calling and task and in parenthesis what is a prophet and his function historically and presently
53:40 -  talk about old testament new testament prophets and again this is off the top of my head it deserves a lot of review and revising but what i like about it is it troubles the waters it's something cast in to get us to begin to reflect and to consider and i'm appreciating all of the
54:00 -  interaction especially the the scriptures that are being cited that are appropriate as we go on maybe we should look at a certain section in jeremiah that i was looking at the other day about prophets that are not sent of God
54:21 -  notice the predominance of the word sent every time i see the word sent something goes off in my spirit and someone asked me on the break well how about apostles aren't they also the foundation of the church i said yes and i don't know if we'll have time to speak of that but both are the
54:35 -  foundational ministries of the of the five fold ministries the apostle the apostles and the prophet are foundational so a lot of what we're saying about prophet is equally as appropriate to apostle and both are sent and that sending is so critical God will never send anything
54:59 -  that does not authentically represent him in fact he says of those whom he sends if you receive then you receive me and if you receive me you receive him who sends me there's an unbroken continuum between the sent one and God himself that's why if someone purports to be that which
55:16 -  is sent and it's not it's a statement about God that is false that's that's what we need deeply to recognize we're not talking about some fluky phenomenon we're talking about the very foundation of the faith which is God as God so in jeremiah 23 speaking about a condition
55:39 -  that has come to Israel and maybe now has come also to the church in verse 11 for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord and there's a conjunction between prophet and priest the prophets prophesy falsely and the
55:58 -  priests their rule by their means it's remarkable how self-serving this reciprocal thing is between heads of movements and fellowships and the and this prophet class and how they relate to each other and are comfortable with each other and affirm one another verse 11 of chapter 23 of
56:21 -  jeremiah oh we're the i think it's in jeremiah three or five five 31 okay very important verse in fact when one of these men began publicly to announce the coming of the other who is today called the apostle the oracle of the hour this scripture immediately flashed into my
56:53 -  remembrance the prophets prophesy falsely and the priest they rule by their means okay they commit adultery in verse 14 and walk in lies so this thing about one of these prophets falling in sexual sin is more than just an aberration or a little idiosyncratic factor factor about his life
57:15 -  is symptomatic of much more and i don't know that it's time now to talk of that but it's interesting that it's in this text in verse 15 at the end of it for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land nothing more profane than when the sacred
57:37 -  is not authentically sacred remember that the the priest shall teach the people the difference between the sacred and the profane and when the sacred becomes profane then there's no hope for anything and that has to do with what
57:53 -  we talked about what men will say and the lord said to me and he did not when you take the sacred phrase and the lord said i nearly employ it as a device to win the attention of your hearers you're desecrating the sacred you're making the sacred profane and once you've done that what can
58:14 -  be hoped for someone has said in the course of our discussions that the condition of the world needs very much to be laid at the door of the church that's true because if we are not as a priestly people setting forth the distinction between the profane and the sacred what can be
58:32 -  hoped for in the world when we ourselves are guilty of turning the sacred into the profane what can we hope for in the world so the ramifications of what we are talking about are beyond any full grasp remarkably consequential that the world is steeped in blood
58:54 -  that there's an amnesty international that monitors torture an organization i get its mailings and i contribute to it whose one function is to monitor torture in the world the the the misuse of prisoners and those that with a week have come into the hands of the powerful
59:15 -  and unbelievable atrocities and tortures and electric products and rates and i don't want to speak of it that that an organization is required to monitor it and that there's no nation exempt from the use of it and the magazine that i received called the
59:32 -  jerusalem reporter probably one of the finest periodicals available an article was written justifying torture on the basis that if Israeli lives can be spared by abstracting from a terrorist some information that would save the possible lives of others and is something that
59:53 -  is planned for their destruction torture is justified in obtaining it that's coming from Israelis so we're in such an age of expediency of the of the end justifying the means that once those things are struck and performed and become commonplace and the convict of all nations what
01:00:18 -  can be hoped for anywhere and there's no human cry i couldn't wait to see what the next issue would bring in letters to the editor one or two very pale lint responses no outcry it's as if there's a consensus of agreement yes torture is an expediency that must be important
01:00:40 -  so profaneness has gone forth into all the land and verse 16 at the end of that verse let's read the whole verse let's say if the lord of hosts harken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesied unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out
01:00:56 -  of the mouth of the lord they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said we talked about this they say the lord has said you shall have peace usually what they say is comforting if you by and large when they say the lord said to me what comes out of it is the kind
01:01:18 -  of the thing that is flattering to the flesh or encouraging rather than challenging or threatening false prophets have historically and proverbially prophesied peace when there is no peace and they say unto everyone that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall
01:01:39 -  come upon you for who hath stood in the council of the lord here's the cry of God and hath perceived and heard his word who hath mocked his word and heard it how dare we say and the lord said who has not stood in the council of the lord and heard his word
01:02:02 -  his word i think it's patently impossible for a huckster a flamboyant gain saying gain seeking minister to even be in that place to be in the council of love itself requires a certain humility a certain brokenness a certain utter dependency upon God a certain capacity to wait
01:02:26 -  a certain separation from self-interest and fame and fortune and recognition men who are attenuated to those things cannot even be in the council of the lord and yet they're the first ones so readily to say and the lord said so mark that verse well
01:02:46 -  for who has stood is lord almost saying where is he to be found who it's got to be so rare that anyone is to be found standing in the council of the lord and has perceived and heard his word isn't it wonderful that samuel became Israel's prophet after they were a long season
01:03:09 -  without prophets that the first word that he heard was a word of judgment and he faithfully communicated it and from that point on God let not any of his words fall to the ground for he was faithful both to hear and to communicate to the lord he didn't mince it
01:03:28 -  he didn't take the sharp edge off of it he didn't dull it he communicated it in full he heard it and he was faithful to communicate it and the lord let none of his words fall to the ground maybe one of the reasons men would even shrink from being in the council of God or hearing it
01:03:51 -  is that they're fearful what they might hear and be required to communicate it's not going to be pleasant seeing the church and the world in its present condition we can rightly anticipate that the lord's word is not going to be some soothing syrupy condescending thing to the flesh of man
01:04:10 -  it's going to be a word that will bring the sword behold a whirlwind of the lord has gone forth in fury even grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord shall not return till we have executed till we have performed his the
01:04:27 -  thoughts of his heart in the latter days you shall consider it perfectly i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied even the word ran is indicative of a certain impatience and haste that is unbecoming
01:04:48 -  but if they had stood in my council and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from the evil way and from the evil of their doings remember what we read yesterday about john the baptist and he shall turn his people
01:05:05 -  back to their God there's a turning that when a true word is spoken that comes from God it affects God's people so to turn them back to himself turn them from the evil way and from the evil of their doings verse 25 i've heard what the
01:05:26 -  prophets say the prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yay they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart which implies to me that they think that they indeed are hearing from God that what
01:05:45 -  they're communicating is the council of God that they've reached such a place of deceit that they that they've persuaded themselves that when they say let's say the lord it is the lord saying when you come to that condition it's pathetic you don't dare bring your predisposition of what you
01:06:02 -  would like to hear or communicate into that place you come as beggar and as one totally dependent and not anything of your own to be affirmed and then will God speak in that place unless he knows that the one to whom he's speaking will faithfully execute his word and not in any way minimize it
01:06:24 -  or soften it there's a great deal of that going on in fact one of the painful things for me in my own ministerial experience is to seek to bring that word faithfully and no longer no sooner to finish than to have the pastor come on the platform and to make a statement that takes the sting out of
01:06:45 -  what was said that once the sharp edge of it and even misconstrues it to make it to be something that it was not i mean i've seen demonstrations of that in this recent conference that i've described and as they would have it on a saturday afternoon there's kind of like an open platform
01:07:05 -  though they had acknowledged me publicly i was never invited to come up and say anything and this brother was and his life was on the line in his whole ministry because to us he was saying how cut up he was he was shredded it was excruciating for him to be in a place being
01:07:24 -  lauded as prophetic and there was no sense of God's presence and no anointing on any speaker and so they called him up and you know how everything is so established there's like a cue for you to follow you've got to respond in a way that goes along it's set up for that
01:07:45 -  for you to strike a contrary note is is a remarkable requirement and i watched this man i knew that what he would say then would have everything to do with his whole continuation and future in God would he dare say publicly what he'd been saying to us privately or would he go
01:08:03 -  along under the pressure of being in the spotlight on the platform being back slapped and hugged and embraced by men as being peer and equal and and and muffle his the truth of what he was feeling and make a kind of acceptable statement and that's the way he started and and my heart began to sink
01:08:23 -  and then he recognized which way he was going in court of itself and he cleared his story and he said i have got to say in all truth that from the moment this conference has begun till this present moment near its conclusion i have yet to experience the presence of God or to witness the anointing
01:08:39 -  of blood in any speaker praise God for truth i said surely this has got to be a turning point this is going to break the balloon this is the air is going to hiss out and will then move into something that's real and then i watched the master ceremonies catholic charismatic with the
01:08:59 -  greatest skill and sophistication that i've ever seen take that statement and turn it in such a way as to affirm what was going on and say let us all stand and pray for our brother and yes he has touched something that is in all of our hearts and i forgot now how he said it is on tape and
01:09:20 -  completely robbed the moment in fact i often watch pastors come up after a prophetic statement here's what i know what they will say in that moment is critical for the whole future of the church and their own integrity and their own standing in God and their own future and their
01:09:38 -  own ministry i wish i could say that in the majority of occasions the men rise to the occasion but more often than not they don't there's something defensive in pastors that wants to protect if not coddle the congregation and think that they have an obligation to protect them from the prophetic
01:10:00 -  word and if they have the courage so much as to have allowed it now they seek somehow to blunt it and to take the edge off of it and that's disastrous so
01:10:16 -  so interesting that verse 27 says about those that have expressed the deceits of their own heart which think to cause my people to forget my name
01:10:34 -  what we were saying was more likely to change his name or to communicate a sense of God that is not God and a lot of to think that it is God because you fashion the name of Jesus to it false prophetic things and things that are deceitful will affect how people perceive and
01:10:53 -  understand God if they're affirmed in their shallowness or a certain likeness and frivolity is communicated and God is the author of that and God was blessed that he cannot help but suffer loss so talk about profaning the sacred
01:11:17 -  and then at verse 29 the cry of God about what a true word is it's not my word like a fire safe lord and like a hammer that breaketh the lock and pieces you want to know what a prophetic word is it'll be like a fire and like a hammer that breaks the lock and pieces it's not going
01:11:33 -  to be some euling gratiating flesh flattering kind of thing that goes along with the popular fashion movements at that same conference that i'm describing to you the one theme that was reiterated again and again was ecumenicism a conference taking place in brighton england
01:11:53 -  which has since now passed on world evangelism and of the 30 speakers 20 of them were either priests or catholic charismatic laymen and when i wrote a letter of critique i hope i'm not running ahead of myself i was so churned up by what had taken place in those days that i was desperately
01:12:13 -  looking for the past that whose church it was conducted a man of very fine reputation couldn't find him so i thought well i've lost my opportunity three days later at home the lord wakened me at 3 a.m exactly the same hour that he wakened me in jerusalem to give me the
01:12:30 -  that message on elijah at that conference and i knew i had to go to my word processor and i ended up with a three-page letter of a critique of that conference and i forgot what i was going that i said in that letter
01:12:46 -  oh here's what i said i'm suspicious of the many appeals in that in those days for people to attend or support this charismatic ecumenical conference on evangelism to give Jesus to the world by the year 2000 seeing that it is supported by a religious movement whose
01:13:21 -  members are made up themselves of the unregenerate how can they purport to be concerned for the evangelism of the world when they're unable to see the condition of those who make up their own ranks every time i've walked into a catholic thing the first thing that strikes me is the darkness
01:13:38 -  everywhere the unregenerate darkness that's not being addressed and yet that church movement is foundational to this whole ecumenical enterprise and that's what was being sounded all throughout the days of that conference without the presence of God and the anointing of God
01:14:00 -  God's word when it comes is like a fire and a hammer that breaks the rock into pieces therefore behold i am against the prophet say of the lord that steal my words everyone from his neighbor now what do you think of that that it is his word perhaps in its inception but when it's
01:14:21 -  spoken subsequently by others it's not that they heard it in the council of the lord but that they heard it from the lips of other men and have adopted it as their own word doesn't that still make it the word of the lord he's as much against those who manufacture a word and say they'll say
01:14:44 -  the lord as he is against those who obtain it second hand from another and pass it off as being their own when it never came to them directly out of communion and fellowship with him would we have the courage to say i have no word if the spotlight is upon us and we're offered
01:15:03 -  opportunity to speak or will we quickly sense you know which way the wind is blowing and what's being accepted and popular now and give ourselves to something of that kind to be caught up in that stream that defined our acceptance and and popular success with it or couldn't we say the lord has
01:15:22 -  with it or couldn't we say the lord has not spoken i have no word i could tell you a few instances over the years where i've had to say that where hundreds of people had assembled with great expectation hoping to hear the word of the lord and i was desperately seeking the lord
01:15:43 -  for that word knowing that and yet when the hour struck he had not given anything and finally i had to get up on the platform and say to the chagrin and disappointment of everyone i'm sorry i have nothing to say the lord has not given me a word and sit down and you can just hear the crunch
01:16:03 -  of the people and how the lord took that silence and allowed the people to exhibit their inability to wait in silence and how they had to fabricate something and someone got up and read a whole chapter scripture and others prophesied and others did this and said that none of it was from God
01:16:22 -  and what that's what the lord wanted us to see how much of what we do is fabricated out of ourselves and after that demonstration came then the lord gave me a word and it was a word of fire and a word of breaking for them and used their behavior as the witness of it and the end thereof
01:16:41 -  was a brokenness and a repentance before God that could not have been obtained in any lesser way but it had to begin by saying the lord has given me no word and i have to sit down so let's just finish this i'm against verse 31 the prophets that say the lord it's interesting
01:16:59 -  that the lord calls them prophets throughout that use their tongues and say he sayeth behold i'm against them that prophesy false dreams sayeth the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their likeness
01:17:17 -  you want you want a symptom that indicates the likelihood of false prophet likeness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all sayeth the lord
01:17:36 -  verse 36 the center of that verse where you have perverted the words of the living God well that deserves a real study but it's remarkable how current it is it's addressed to Israel in its hour of apostasy but it's remarkable how you would think God was explicitly speaking to
01:17:58 -  our present hour it's so valid so appropriate okay so what is a prophet in his function historically and presently one to unsparingly without fear and regard of man critique and lay bare the lie of the conventional truth the assumed i will the assumed mindless uncontested premises
01:18:25 -  that constitute death and not life so sorry about this you know when you when you give something off the top of your head it's not as clear as when you've had time to think it through and write it more carefully but i wanted to just give you the the brunt of the thought what is a prophet's
01:18:46 -  function and it's not the whole of it to critique and lay bare the lie to reveal it to expose it to blow the whistle the lie of the conventional truth and that line may well be the lives of the false prophets that say that they have had dreams from God and let God say it
01:19:06 -  the assumed mindless uncontested premises that constitute death and not life we talked about this at the very beginning of the school the principalities and the powers of the air and the wisdom of this world the unchallenged premises by which the world lives its life
01:19:22 -  which is a lie which completely disregards the subject of eternity that says that that the self-evident truth is the pursuit of your own happiness and the taking care of number one that the whole world is predicated on false value on lies but how shall it know except that the
01:19:41 -  word of truth come and if it comes it's got to come from one who can do it unsparingly and without fear and regard of man and all of us know that the fear of man is the most powerful and crippling factor that works in the lives of God's ministers
01:20:02 -  to be free of that to speak without regard to the fear of man is an ultimate statement that implies such a history of dealing with that servant because we don't come like that ready-made we come we're born with the fear of men we we live for the regard of men and their acknowledgement
01:20:23 -  and their applause and this has been so powerful a factor against it for the church with the jewish community for the jewish community to acknowledge you as a minister and give you the plaque for the benedrift man of the year that makes your heart palpitate men love the acknowledgments of men
01:20:41 -  particularly prestigious men in the world but to be able to speak without regard to that there's no small thing and it takes unquestionable and ruthless dealings of God right what did it cost that brother at that public place on that platform on saturday to say
01:21:01 -  from the beginning of this conference at this moment i have not sensed the presence of God nor witnessed the anointing of God on any speaker and he lives in that city and he's a minister in that city and attends the evangelical ministers functions in that city and he's saying that about
01:21:16 -  men who have already spoken in that conference who are ministers in that city and the man who whose church has was to be given over to that conference he's making a public statement what did it cost him brother talk about the cross everything a moment of truth had come put up
01:21:35 -  or shut up and i praised God that he came through but many of us at such a moment will not come through if our regard for men is greater than our regard for God if there's something craven in our hearts that must have the acknowledgement of men that's
01:21:56 -  more important to us than hearing in the day of eternity well done my faithful servant and you know you you got to be weaned it's a process of being weaned away from that necessity it doesn't take place in the day but every time God brings you to that winning you've got to
01:22:14 -  submit to it until you come to a place where you don't need it you're altogether indifferent not only to the applause of men but to their criticisms and to their reproaches can you can you hear from men when they'll say to you that you've done incalculable damage to the body of
01:22:31 -  christ that you need to make a public apology right now can can you bear to hear that when your whole life has been given over to the Gods to the church and to the true unity of this people and to hear ironically that the very thing that you're accused of is the disunity of the body
01:22:52 -  that you're promoting the disunity by your speaking can you bear it so that's why the character of the man the moral ability to stand alone to stand before ahab and says the lord my God lives before whom i stand it shall not do this this and this why because i stand before him
01:23:15 -  what that phrase means as as the lord my God lives i don't know him in a secondhand way or about him as a theology or set of donkeys as the lord my God lives before whom i stand it shall not rain or do but according to my word you know i stand exclusively before God
01:23:37 -  i'm not even intimidated by you and you're the king of Israel the most apostate and filthy king of all that have preceded you and you can take my head off in a moment it does not matter as the lord my God lives before whom i stand and it will mean your head if you're still alive
01:23:56 -  to keeping your head on your shoulders you'll not be able to say that and i'm not talking about some brazen buff you know blustering braggadocio chutzpah you know as the lord my God lives before whom i stand look at me and i don't need you it's a humbling brokenness that just acknowledges that
01:24:20 -  God is God and i i am not accountable to anyone no outside of him that's not to say i've been different or unrelated to the body and the church and to its its authorities i'm a single man for but when we face the eight eight halves of this world that's that has to be true of us
01:24:42 -  in fact we can will not be able to say because the lord my God lives before whom i stand unless we're rightly related in the body if we're some arrogant solo individual that's above any other authority because i'm a prophet of God and i don't have to bend or yield to this one or to
01:25:00 -  that i do my own things and God knows when i have you're not standing before that you're standing before him truly because you're authentically related because you've submitted yourself because you're humbled the prophet's own lifestyle must itself be a repudiation of the lie
01:25:22 -  or you can't blow the whistle on false values if you yourself are subscribing to them there's something about apostolic poverty that is more than an accident or happenstance it's just appropriate to apostolic life there's something about the loincloth and the eating of
01:25:41 -  the camel's hair garment and the eating of the locusts and wild honey that has that's intrinsic to the prophetic life there's a reason why john is in the wilderness and not in Jerusalem though he's the son of a priest he cannot be where the establishment is he cannot enjoy its benefits
01:25:58 -  and at the same time blow the whistle on the falsity of it you cannot subscribe you cannot in your own lifestyle indulge and partake of the very thing that you're condemning before others as being the lie so lifestyle is remarkably important about the word that is going forth
01:26:20 -  and probably nothing more betrays whether you're a true prophet or false than this and maybe what can you say the false prophets ate from jezebel's table your life you had to be fed by ravens and live by a brook it's not that you seek to wear a loincloth or i mean the camel's hair garment
01:26:40 -  because it's romantic and you have to dress in such a way as marks you as being distinctively distinctively different but the values that are false cannot have a place in you so
01:27:03 -  a total rejection of that system's preferences and practices however legitimated by society and even the church it's not that it's inherently sinful and not values that are apparently evil because the world and even the church will approve if not sanctify them others can but you cannot
01:27:26 -  because you are called to reveal the lie the underlying premises that need to be examined in the light of God about value about life and its purposes and therefore you cannot your own life lifestyle must be a repudiation of that lie however legitimated by society and
01:27:45 -  even the church his speaking not only reveals the lie but condemns and judges it his word itself is a divine destruct the prophet does not just identify he destroys something about his word what did God say it's it's like a fire it's a hammer that breaks up the rock
01:28:07 -  it's plucking up and rooting out and destroying before it's planting and building who wants the human like that they don't they don't they don't not only just bring things into question they absolutely reduce it to rubble before your eyes
01:28:24 -  you to pick it up after that is to touch the the unclean thing they've identified it and now you're stuck with that word no wonder that such men are not welcomed in places where people want to continue their lifestyle unchallenged
01:28:45 -  um my my deepest heart's desire is that you embrace my message because i believe it to be true and holy and on time but not as a mimic or a parrot or an echo but that it becomes your own and that you can't even speak it except by the same givingness that i have to wait for from the
01:29:06 -  spirit of God because i've spoken it before it doesn't give me leave to speak it the next time it has to be given afresh in fact it's no accident that my worst faculty humanly speaking is memory my memory is pathetic and terribly embarrassing and i can't remember what i spoke the last time
01:29:25 -  it's almost as if God has got to give it afresh each time and one of the evidences of that is that no two speakings even on the same subject is ever the same there's always a uniqueness and a an expression of it appropriate for those who are now hearing i think it's got to be that for you
01:29:44 -  certain the last thing i would want is to raise up any brainwashed men who have been taken in and and were just automatically parrot see for yourself make it your own and if the lord wants it to be proclaimed and i think it needs to be then by the same liberty of the spirit that i
01:30:04 -  myself have to wait for that's not the whole answer but it's a good beginning i think that what's implied is that you promulgate it as if you had gotten it directly from God when you have gotten it second hand it might even be a true word but it's not the word that is true
01:30:21 -  in your mouth remember the little woman said and now by this i know that the word of God in your mouth is truth implies that it's not truth in another mouth the very same word it's not truth and don't we experience that there's 10 men can say the same thing it's all biblical and we leave
01:30:36 -  nine of them and ho hum and and where are we going now to eat something the 10th man we're devastated he said exactly the same thing but all of it there's a penetration because the word in his mouth is truth and whatever that takes and this is what we're
01:30:52 -  wanting to probe this is what we need to about the most of desire God forbid that the word in our mouth should be a yawn for those who hear it out of us that it's just a commonplace and that the sacred thing has been robbed and that the husk of it may be true but it has no penetrating and
01:31:11 -  persuading power wherever it takes that the word be true may we give ourselves and it's going to take much it's going to take sacrifice and maybe the unwillingness of men to bear that sacrifice and to be content only with the husk of what is externally correct has been what has been
01:31:32 -  prevailing up to now and God's people have so long not seen any alternative that they have accepted that as normative but when the day comes that they hear a word of God that is true they're ruined for anything else after that i just got a letter yesterday from england
01:31:49 -  thanking me for sending them a few tapes and she said i can't listen now to other cassettes i'm ruined she said i can't listen to other cassettes all of a sudden the i didn't recognize before but they have a hollow sound there's a place for friendship and relationship and being
01:32:06 -  groomed and encouraged and inspired but when the rubbers got to hit the road for you you can't mimic the one who was your mentor but you need to be as authentic as steve now in the thing that you proclaim maybe the heart of mentoring is not the same mimic me but find the same source that
01:32:25 -  i have found as we continually encourage the younger one to that source so the prophet not only reveals the light but condemns and judges it by his word it becomes a divine destruct and then i give you this scripture out of john 15 if i had not come and spoken they had not had sin but now
01:32:47 -  they have no cloak for their sin something has come with the speaking that you can never go back to where you were before an event has come a proclamation and a demonstration and to go back to it now after God has spoken is virtually sin you have no excuse no cloak for this and
01:33:09 -  the prophets are authority and i have in parenthesis penetration and cogency authority is not well you know that's a real area that word authority wow it's not your credentials there's something resonates i don't have the ability to open that up and
01:33:32 -  but it contains the that thing that penetrates and makes cogent authority is something that gives to the word a heft certain quality of penetration that if you don't have it the same word is limp and that authority is relative to his lifestyle his radical separation
01:33:52 -  from the thing being critiqued as well as the measure of his real intimacy with the God of truth Paul says we have not the spirit of the world but the spirit of God and we have the spirit of God to the degree that we are separated from the spirit of the world
01:34:09 -  so did you get that the moment of obedience may come as one standing alone before ahab but the thing that makes that powerful and confrontational is that what has preceded it is the man coming out
01:34:42 -  of a corporate life and that the genius of what that corporate life is for the man who is going to critique the error and the falsities of the church in the world is that he himself has been critiqued that the that the corporate life is not idealized it's not some more romantic community
01:35:00 -  out in the boondocks because you'd like nature it's a situation where that man is more subject to review and examination than any other who make up that community last night was a little taste of public exposure you know and some of you have heard some of the older tapes will remember that
01:35:20 -  the last thing i heard before going off to the morning prayer meeting was inger's shout after being offended at something i'd said or done or failed to do with the slam of a door as i left go tell them what a great saint you are and everyone could virtually hear that shelf
01:35:38 -  or know what was going on you can't conceal in community you know the you're up for grabs you're open to examination and i think i mentioned once before that i was critiqued for my my manner of speaking that i came back from the trip and i said boy the place was so jam-packed that people were
01:35:56 -  hanging from the chandeliers and i was immediately jumped for that exaggeration there was that literally true i well no not exactly the figure of speech well you know if you begin to employ figure of speeches like that it won't be long before your exaggeration
01:36:10 -  will turn into a lie i want to rise up and say hey i've got my my prophetic liberty of license to but that's exactly what we need we need to be cut down at the pass and if community is not rendering that service then i can't think of anyone in greater danger than a prophetic personality
01:36:31 -  so i'm mentioning this now that this is connected both with his authority the penetration and cogency of this word because he's a man profoundly communal and i think that has everything to do with the school of the prophets in the old testament although not much detail is given about them
01:36:48 -  so not only is he frequently critiqued by others he desires to be critiqued it doesn't shun it he makes himself accessible a prophet who prefers privacy is solo and unattended by others but is surrounded by a self-affirming paid and mutually congratulatory quote staff
01:37:12 -  unquote is likely false or will become so there's a difference between community and being surrounded by a staff of paid employees of the kind i i know that jimmy swankert had and the other and jimmy baker as well who will affirm
01:37:33 -  and endorse that personality in what he does because he butters their bread but it's a different thing to be surrounded by people who are not your staff and are being paid by you but are in a proximity in a relationship where they have every freedom to critique you and
01:37:49 -  speak into your life though you may be God's man of you know in ministry right because they will naturally be intimidated by the authority and the stature of that man so they need to be encouraged to it because he himself recognizes that if he is not receiving that kind of input and
01:38:11 -  examination the the personality that is most dangerously given to deception is the prophetic personality all the more because he experiences the anointing of God the unction and the power and it can be carried away by that to think that he's invincible and that because God is so
01:38:30 -  anointing him in the place of ministry that that must be the statement of his approval of his life in its entirety and that misunderstanding has been the formula for a disaster and falling of many great men of God you could be anointed in the place of ministry
01:38:49 -  but there is defects in your defects and contradictions in your life personally and privately that need to be attended and seen and that you not only are open to but welcome and invite or you put yourself in a place to become a false prophet
01:39:09 -  the prophet's task is to establish an alternative consciousness powerful valid enough to utterly displace the lie he presents a view of reality not yet existent and contrary in most points in particulars to that which is labeled real
01:39:28 -  he brings a heavenly and an eternal sense that obliterates the kind of validation and endorsement that the world's values have had for his years till that time if he had not come they would have thought that what they had thought real is real
01:39:50 -  but when he comes by his speaking he's not only critiquing and blowing the whistle in what is false but he brings a sense of what is true and what is eternally true he brings the sense of eternity itself
01:40:07 -  the things that have not yet become real in the life of this year's but because of that speaking set them in motion to obtain a place where it will become real because there had not been before that any precedent or model in the experience of the
01:40:27 -  of the hero it's a real thus saith the lord where the word becomes creative and establishes a resonance of something not understood before as something that is ultimate something that is eternal imagine what kind of a word would be required to communicate that to people who have
01:40:46 -  been locked in time locked in culture locked in religious culture to pierce through that and to raise another kind of a standard and make that the foundation of life is an extraordinary kind of speaking you would have to say the man would have to come from heaven itself yes he himself
01:41:06 -  has to be to be so devoid of earthliness so above time so above culture himself be a statement of the thing that he's speaking there needs to be such a corroboration between what what he says and what he is or it can never succeed when you when you think of that as a as an aspect of the
01:41:27 -  prophetic mystery and think of what is being spoken and exhibited as prophetic you you want to cry so i'm these are all statements at the top of my head and interesting the kind of reactions that i got from people whom it was sent i sent out 50 of these lennard ravenhill rick
01:41:51 -  rick joiner and i got some responses most of them were approving but one in particular was almost violent and angry and accusing me of being loveless judgmental and joyless and was concerned for me because i wrote what i did and i suspect that somehow some of these
01:42:15 -  statements gored the ox and pricked something there that they're elicited that kind of a reaction this heavenly thing is what reality is itself if the world is dying for anything it is what is real and to establish what is real in the world of of the synthetic
01:42:38 -  is as a remarkable demonstration more than proclamation and this is i think why people are dying freaking out going into mental institutions seeing psychiatrists and their marriages collapsing and all the other kinds of symptoms is the absence of
01:42:55 -  reality and even the sense of it that needs to be brought by someone like this i'll just finish this point and we'll cut it off at this at this statement those that embrace it condemn themselves to becoming pilgrims and strangers in the earth you can't hear a word like that and walk away
01:43:19 -  or indifferently to hear a word like that requires something if you say yes to it you're condemned from that point on becoming a pilgrim a stranger and a sojourner in the earth which i think is God's definitive intention for us all that's a fearful thing
01:43:42 -  able also to die not having received a promise confident of their inheritance in the life to come this does not assign them to irreverency in this life but but rather more formidable and feared by the powers of darkness so people who respond to that word and buy it choose to become
01:44:04 -  pilgrims and strangers don't condemn themselves to any relevancy in the world they become more relevant and more recognized and more feared by the powers of the air they're not walking on it's not a a superficial spirituality it's something that strikes terror at the heart of
01:44:20 -  the powers of darkness for this is this is liberation to be a pilgrim a stranger and
