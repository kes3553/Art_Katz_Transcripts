Judgement 1 of 2

00:00 -  could be over my God like a vapor and so we're asking my God again your perfect and thorough redemption of the time that you'll be putting before us the deepest dearest things of your heart that are appointed my God for these days that
00:17 -  we may grant us a facility to keep up with you to be in lockstep with you to have your yoke my God to wear your yoke and not to fall behind in any way we bless you Lord and we look to you the God who has called us and is fitting and
00:38 -  preparing us bless this time now and all that shall follow in these days and the school that should be the conference the weekend gathering my God that shall thank you my God may the days end with joy unspeakable full of glory your heart
00:58 -  and in ours we ask it in Jesus' name. Lord what you're putting before us this morning yet again we ask my God that you would strike a chord in our hearts that perhaps has not yet been touched nor sounded of the soberness of it my God of the fear of
01:28 -  it of the apprehension of its meaning my God that must fuel all of our ministry and doing for you in the days that remain it's a sober hour Lord we have not been sufficiently sobered we know and we don't know as we ought to know but we
01:49 -  asked that you would give us a fear this morning that you would communicate something beyond our minds and our understandings something of the dread of that terrible day would strike our hearts my God with a new power and the
02:06 -  before that might have been tolerated and allowed to find no place in the deep seriousness that comes to us as a result Lord we suspect that the whole world is in a state of deception it simply does not believe that there will be an end
02:24 -  there's no sense of finality it deludes itself to thinking that things will always go on as they are somehow they'll get better and Lord that's what my own Jewish people thought when the dark clouds gathered over Germany it didn't
02:41 -  get better and they went up my God as smoke they burned and what a foreshadowing Lord of that eternal judgment that awaits the unsuspecting and we know that there's nothing more thoroughly ridiculed than the thought of
02:59 -  doomsday and it's an object of derision and scorn but my God give us an ability to sound that Trump not only for the unsuspecting world but for the sleeping church Lord we ask an event this morning in the contemplation of the subject your
03:20 -  judgment changes by it thank you give you the praise for the privilege that is ours in the contemplation of your burdens for your word and your spirit attend to us grant us every grace thank you give you the praise in Jesus name
03:43 -  well I think I'm going to be quoting pretty liberally from a little book that called the royal priesthood that was out of print I don't know that I was a factor in its reissue but it has been made available again I think it first
04:03 -  came out in 1971 and I think you'll appreciate the particular quality of writing that God has given this most precious thing remember that when we discussed prophetic I used the word oracular and that the thing that I look
04:25 -  for in the message of a purported prophet is the oracular weight of the speaking I'm not sure that I could define it on the spot the oracles of God the things that come out of the secret place where you sense the weight and the
04:42 -  heft of that word there are reverberations and if I would say that there's any 20th century oracle to whom I can give unequivocal endorsement it would be this woman and from the reports that are given her that she makes of
05:05 -  herself when her writings come they just flow and there's just a beauty to her prose a clarity of expression that's very much akin to the character of the woman herself no flab no ostentation no unnecessary flowery verbiage it's a
05:24 -  clean and very clear word and we have been so spoiled by lots of verbiage to we finally get to hear that the nub that we're like half-dulled waiting for this a good thing I'll tell you if you have that mentality you'll miss it from the
05:42 -  first word on it's a statement that needs to be attended from the beginning so I'm turning almost into the middle of the book just to get on the subject of judgments and I love this about her woman that she is she does not spare or
06:02 -  sidestep the subject of judgment even in writing about Israel she's full of love for the nation for the people she shares the clear biblical hope and expectation for its destiny and future but she will not wince or withhold
06:23 -  making the necessary acknowledgments about the judgments of God toward that people both in the historic past and in their future so I love that it's very much the heart of God himself as I hope will come to see here she's talking
06:40 -  about the day of the Lord and I'll just read you little fragments just to begin to point our spirits toward this subject the return of the Lord is near the judgments of God the writers of the apocalypse who pass with fury over the
06:56 -  face of the earth and the seriousness of whose coming is not lessened by periods of comfort proclaim the imminence of his coming they are the messengers of judgment yet they prepare the way for the appearing of the Lord of Lords who
07:10 -  will come to judge the world and to visit men's iniquity and who will be able to endure his judgments who we are aware that fearful judgments undeniable undeniably await us horror hunger and death are heightened with every war and
07:32 -  there is no place of rest and peace to be found and yet these are are all only preliminary judgments from which there is still hope of deliverance she's the only one I've ever heard use that phrase that sees present judgments as
07:49 -  preliminary pointing to a greater final and ultimate judgment and that's a wonderful seeing but it will be dreadful at the coming of Jesus to fall into the hands of the living God and to have to endure the day capital D of his
08:04 -  appearing capital a of which it is said in Isaiah 13 6 whale for the day of the Lord is near as destruction from the Almighty it will come then everyone hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains calling to the mountains and
08:23 -  us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who can stand before it and this day is near even at the door for God's Word cannot fail and
08:40 -  this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world and then the end will come word end should register such a note of finality nothing is negotiable after that time anything that could have been attended by the
08:58 -  grace of God finish it's an end to discussion to consideration to appeal finality it's a when like like the blade of the guillotine there's no further discussion the head lops off and then the end will come yes the world is ripe
09:17 -  unto harvest how the world situation is judged today is shown according to the declaration of the experts in that the release of an atom bomb can mean the devastation and destruction of the whole world the various signs of the times
09:30 -  indicate the end is near and the coming of the Lord is imminent the world is hastening toward its downfall and destruction these are last days of grace all of that is to point to our priestly ministry to a dying world in the last
09:51 -  days and it's not really a book devoted to the subject of judgment itself but that's just a little sober sounding to heighten the importance of our ministry in such a world slated for destruction devastation and judgment now I'm reading
10:13 -  from another German-speaking theologian Emil Brunner BRU double NER who was a contemporary of Carl Bart's bar th do we have an obligation Saints to have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the great Christian thinkers in the in the
10:35 -  history of the church it's a grace of God to have given the church such men the remarkable thing is that Emil Brunner has fallen completely out of vogue while Carl Bart still remains as a formidable epical 20th century Christian thinker
10:56 -  Emil Brunner is almost something of an embarrassment because he is so evangelical he's so fundamental and and I have a very great fondness for him if you find his books they're likely to be found out of print he's not reissued
11:14 -  because he doesn't have a following as some of the other more popular men have here's what he says about judgment sin against God is an attack on God's honor sin is rebellion against the Lord but God cannot permit his honor to be
11:31 -  attacked for his honor is his God had his sovereign majesty God would cease to be God if he could permit his honor to be attacked the law of his divine being on which all the law and order in the world is based the fundamental order of the
11:46 -  world the logical and reliable character of all that happens the validity of all standards of all intellectual legal and moral order the law itself in its most profound meaning demands divine reaction the divine
12:01 -  concern about sin the divine resistance through this rebellion and this breach of order so God's judgments are not capricious the whole of creation requires them because if you did not attend to the violations of his own
12:17 -  name which is what sin is and let it go by as some slip-shart thing the way we let it go without kids his name is at stake because his name is central to the whole coherence of his creation if that goes everything goes if that standard
12:37 -  collapses there is no standard so it's a jealousy for his name that is more than just a petulant God who is egotistical about himself he himself is central to his whole creation and therefore he's required to judge he's patient he's
12:55 -  forbearing he allows the cup of iniquity to come full but in the end judgment must come for very creation sake for the very order of the cosmos itself it demands divine reaction the holiness of God requires the annihilation
13:17 -  of the will which resists God God is not mocked if this were not true then there would be no seriousness in the world at all in fact we can well say that the absence of seriousness in the world but how do how can we say it the mindless
13:36 -  state of the world today absolutely unaware of its consequences doing its own thing herald and its own disaster without any fear the way that men are acting that they the filthy and degrading things that the abduction of
13:56 -  children off the streets and I mean the horrors what's going on in Bosnia Yugoslavia a program of genocidal annihilation and it's being done before the face of all the world they know that the whole Western world is looking on on
14:10 -  that spectacle and they don't give a wrap they know that the Western world is they've got it over the barrel there's no way that that any intervention can actually come the presence of UN troops what is that it's a spit in the bucket
14:24 -  there's no way to monitor that situation let alone control it and there's not an iota of shame or conviction or guilt we're a generation that doesn't blush anymore blushing is an archaic phenomenon it simply does not happen we
14:43 -  have we've lost a sense of shame and we're just products of a world in which anything goes and the whole thing in the last analysis can be attributed to the dismissal of God but he's not mocked if this were not true then there
15:04 -  would be no seriousness in the world at all there would be no meaning in anything no order no stability the word the world order would fall into ruins chaos and desolation would be supreme and in fact that's what we're tending to it all
15:17 -  order in the world depends upon the inviolability of his honor upon the certitude that those who rebel against him will be punished that's his statement now here's mine this is written by the way at the seminary interestingly in the
15:32 -  same class where a woman gave a talk on witchcraft not as something to be feared or hated or despised or to be understood as a present-day phenomenon but to be embraced not as an addendum to the faith but as a replacement for the faith that
15:49 -  the that the mother Goddess is the primary force in the universe that even precedes of the father and there's a whole sexist feministic piece of filth that was right out of the pit of hell and I sat in the class listening to this
16:10 -  because we were each required to give a paper and a talk I gave mine later on judgment she gave us first on witchcraft and I may have mentioned this when a class is already went up to the professor you can pray pray for him dr.
16:27 -  spunheim I said it Luther would turn over in his grave if he knew that an institution that bore his name Luther Northwestern theological seminary that an institution bearing his name was given over to a talk of this kind this
16:41 -  morning he said well we need to understand I said that's too high a price to pay for understanding so these filthy things are going on right virtually in the holy place so I want you to understand that to know that now
16:57 -  this paper was read to that woman and the other women in the class who were in a complete accord with her and all who had heard her talk and approved it there is perhaps no attribute of God more difficult for the church than the wrath
17:14 -  or judgment of God atheists pounced with glee in what appears to them to be an irreconcilable contradiction to the character of God and even the church squirms uncomfortably to equate his goodness with his severity the word
17:35 -  judgment makes us uncomfortable that somehow it doesn't fit how do we equate that with God we are much more disposed to meditate upon his love or mercy foolishly forgetting that if God be God he is indivisible and that one cannot
17:51 -  elevate or denigrate one attribute above or below another remember that the robe of Jesus was seamless they could not part it and that's the statement of God himself he's seamless he's indivisible you cannot divide him let alone elevate
18:14 -  or denigrate or raise or lower any one attribute of God as being higher than another is his love higher than than his righteousness or his truth or his mercy than his judgment he's one the Lord our God is one to reject or to give
18:35 -  begrudging or scant acknowledgement which is very much the same as rejection any attribute of God then would be tantamount to rejecting God I'm afraid almost to read the next statement that we've not gotten this one
18:52 -  to give scant acknowledgement or a begrudging condescension I guess it's true that yes God has also got a judgment is tantamount or equal to rejecting God to reject any portion of God is to reject God entirely and this
19:15 -  is you need to be aware of this in your conversation with my Jewish people some of whom will be gracious enough to acknowledge that Jesus was a great prophet and a great teacher and think that they can put their thumbs in their
19:28 -  suspenders and lean back that they've done God's service they will burn all the more embarrassingly in hell for that acknowledgement to say that of him and not to acknowledge all that is true of him is a much greater indictment than if
19:47 -  you would have said he was a presumer and a misguided zealot or a megalomaniac who presumed to be the Messiah and was not better you should believe that then to compliment him for his virtue of being a great teacher and prophet for
20:01 -  how can it be a great teacher and a prophet and allow men to fall at his feet and cry out my Lord and my God and not rebuke them and by the same token how can we say that we love God and know God and yet we have a controversy with
20:18 -  any aspect of God that we are not willing to acknowledge as being an attribute of God if you have a controversy with God as judge you have a controversy with God and in fact nothing more reveals your controversy than this
20:33 -  when you have made your peace with God as judge when you have accepted the judgment of God as being as blessed an attribute of God as his mercy and his love you then love God to love him at his most difficult place is to love him
20:50 -  entirely and the same thing may be true in our marriages if you can love your husband in that place or your wife in that place you really love them maybe you can find scriptures that support that you know Dean
21:25 -  you think that's because we truly don't fear God because we don't actually know his love yeah it's just a very lighthearted relationship that we this is too deep for words you know what we're doing unconsciously we who do who
21:47 -  shrink at God's judgment or God as judge are really judging him what we're saying is I love your mercy and your love and your kindness and your goodness but it has some question about your judgment we are elevating ourselves above him and
22:06 -  finding fault as if we are in a place to determine which of his attributes are acceptable and which not there's nothing that reveals the secret heart at balking at the judgment of God it's as if God set a booby trap to unveil and to
22:27 -  reveal those who love him and those who do not love him at all I don't I say this is too deep for words I'm only taking a stab at it but this is what my spirit suspects there's something about us that is that's not comfortable with
22:46 -  him as judge we we think that somehow judgment punishment wrath of God is not compatible with God as we think him to be and this reveals where we're dreamers romantics idealists and humanists and that though we employ the word Jesus
23:05 -  what we have is a God of our own making he's our construct we have made him in our image rather than he making us in his we have set him up in a way that is supportive of our mentality our lifestyle our choices our values but
23:24 -  there's one flight in the ointment it's judgment it's like we stumble you know at the stone of offense which is why I say if you can love God in his judgments and in fact love his judgments and see in them the great redemptive beauty of
23:47 -  God his great love for his creation that the wisdom of it and the rightness of it however terrible the pain of it don't forget that it pains him as well as us don't think that when his judgments come he's looking down and
24:05 -  twiddling his thumbs and and poking his fingers through his hair and whistling Dixie and all of our afflictions he's afflicted it cuts him to the quick you have to judge he knows the full pain and the agony of it and if there were
24:22 -  any alternative he would have performed it in fact of the matter he has performed it and judgment only comes when every last alternative has been exhausted very good yeah that may have more to say about David being the
24:52 -  beloved of God a man after his own heart if we don't quibble over the judgments of God and not only to take them stoically and bravely but even to rejoice for them it almost sounds like a psychological disorder that you can
25:16 -  rejoice in the judgments of God and I know that we can find scriptures maybe I should have prepared myself more thoroughly where it says that creation itself nature itself rejoices at God's judgments so here's dumb inanimate
25:30 -  nature sensing somehow that it's at a level of creation less than ours more rejoicing in judgment than we who have ability to discern to discriminate and to speak judgment is good because God is good and nothing that issues from him
25:50 -  is not good and if we have any difficulty the problem is not with him it's with us so let me make that statement again to reject and then I have in parentheses or to give begrudging acknowledgment which is the
26:11 -  same thing as rejection if your acceptance of God's judgment is only begrudging it constitutes a rejection unless your acceptance of his judgment is with a rejoicing you have not really accepted it a lot of us are begrudging I
26:32 -  mean how can you fight against God I guess I gotta you know this the truth of the matter what am I going to do but we're not doing it graciously and we're not doing it joyfully which is which is really to say we're not doing it and to
26:51 -  reject any attribute of God is to reject God you can't have him piecemeal it's all or nothing at all and of course the same thing is true of this Lordship and we've talked about that before there's so much as exercise one veto over any one
27:08 -  thing however small and say for the other 99 percent he has the full right to determine the conditions of mine but for this one thing I reserve that for myself you have dismissed the whole issue of his Lordship just the nature of
27:25 -  the thing he's Lord over all or he's Lord over nothing and many of us who are yet falling short of the glory of God and the joy of God are falling short at that point why are we depressed why are we moody why are we dispirited because
27:44 -  there's some one thing that has not been given over to his Lordship it doesn't have us totally because the moment he does the joy of the Lord is automatic it follows and it flows you don't have to fish for it and you don't have to
28:00 -  fabricate it to have any reservation begrudging acknowledgement would be to hold a human view of God more the projection of our own fancy than of himself isn't this the last deception to hold a view of God which is our view
28:24 -  rather than who he is in himself and how many of us are guilty of that nearly because we label that God Jesus does not make it that God the final idolatry the most subtle of all is the God that we ourselves have formulated and think that
28:47 -  somehow it's sanctified because we've pinned the label Jesus on it that's why I can know him is the ultimate thing as he is in a word not the least of the values of judgment is to reveal our own true hearts attitude toward him in that
29:09 -  judgment functions in part to bring to light the hidden things of darkness what is implied for example when we take issue with or are revolted by his judgments as I've described in the scriptures what does it mean that a
29:25 -  brother has a near nervous breakdown in trying to write about the Holocaust because he has really not the rest of the visual judgment I cannot take it do we not imply a moral superiority over God for that which offends our moral
29:42 -  scruples in fact standing as judge over him in that which he has freely expressed about himself you can just can you see the audacity of it we standing above God and determining which of his attributes are acceptable and which are
29:56 -  incompatible with him as we think he ought to be puts us above God to affirm him in that which is most difficult for ourselves may well be the ultimate test of our devotion as in the same degree that as to annul him and so much as the
30:16 -  least of requirements is to make void his Lordship Lordship if we just talked about that God enjoins the love of him with the totality of himself and the totality of our response to him is summed up in the Shema of Deuteronomy 6
30:30 -  verses 4 & 5 here O Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is one and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might the very first statement of Israel's requirement here O Israel
30:45 -  Shema YIsrael is the Lord our God is one it may well be then that the wrath of God far from being incidental let alone least in our esteem of God's attributes is actually the key not only to our recognition but to our relationship with
31:03 -  him this one thing is the key not only to our acknowledgement of who he is but our relationship with him as he is after noting that the central point in every human being is his attitude toward God Brunner the Swiss theologian
31:25 -  continues only where man recognizes this reality of wrath does he take his guilt seriously only then does he realize the personal character of God and his own human personal relationship to God remember Isaiah and Isaiah 6 and he
31:43 -  showed the Lord high and lifted up woe is me I am a man of unclean lips Job I've heard of you to hear in the mind but now my eyes here and I despise myself every true scene of God brings a judgment on our own humanity we see
32:01 -  ourselves only truly in the light of seeing him truly and maybe this is why we walk at surrendering to God as judge because the last deception about ourselves goes with that recognition boy I'll tell you ego is a fierce thing and
32:21 -  I think maybe they're the greatest blessing of that book reality is the description of the slaughter of the pig in the land side-by-side the lamb you didn't hear boo hung it by its by its feet and cut its throat and it bled to
32:35 -  death without a whimper but that pig my God the shrieks the howls the noises the grumblings I never heard so much tumult come out of a piece of protoplasm in all my life and it continued a gawk and squawk and jerk and and carry on you
32:53 -  might have thought that the whole of creation was at stake for a stinking piece of pig life before it finally gave its last gasp and when we when we put that knife in and skin that animal out we found out that that that first knife
33:06 -  that went into it actually had punctured its heart and it still continued to squeal and kick and groan it would not give up the ghost and I think I said in reality I'll never again believe the truth of an altar call by people who
33:24 -  come down and cry a crocodile tear and kneel and give up their lives for Christ until I see that kicking till I hear those shrieks and howls I'll not be persuaded that self has really come to death it's too stubborn if a piece of
33:40 -  protoplasmic thing the most simple that God could make called the pink kicks like that and will not give up its life are we to think that we who have so long nurtured and cultivated and powered it and pampered our self-life are going to
33:58 -  give it up with a phrase I'm surrendering to the Lord the depth the depth the depth of self will find any sneaky way to continue and to perpetuate its existence you take away your penthouse magazine it'll find an
34:16 -  opportunity in the Bible it'll find opportunity in your spirituality as well as your carnality and your sensuality don't don't be deceived do we not imply a moral superiority over God that moral superiority itself in its great
34:41 -  spirituality determining what is acceptable in our perception of him standing as judge over him though he has freely expressed what he is in himself as judge to affirm him in that which is most difficult for ourselves
34:57 -  may well be an ultimate test of our devotion that God enjoins the love of him with the top totality of himself is summed up as we've read in the Shema it may well be then that the wrath of God far from being incidental let alone
35:10 -  least in our esteem of God's attributes is actually the key not only to our recognition but to our true relationship with him and then reading again from Brunner that the full Christian message the full conception of the personality
35:32 -  of God carries with it indubitably the recognition of the divine wrath and I probably say this later on in this paper all we need to see in the way that we have sidestepped that is to look at our evangelism compare our evangelistic
35:49 -  message with that spoken in the book of Acts where Peter from the very first message of Pentecost clearly indicts his hearers whether they were even there at the time of course of the crucifixion Jesus was having hanged him on a tree
36:07 -  they are implicated in his murder no wonder they were cut to the heart and said men and brethren what must we do to be safe it's a powerful indictment but what is the basis of our evangelism God has a plan for your life it's predicated
36:22 -  from the very first on the benefit that comes to you believing by believing it has not at all anything to say that God is hanging with the sinner and that is that he who hath the Son hath life and he who hath not the Son hath not life and the
36:36 -  wrath of God abides upon him we don't want to consider God as being angry it's not polite to think of God as being wrathful and our unwillingness to consider that is clearly reflected in our very shallow evangelism and people
36:56 -  who come to the Lord on the basis of that shallow message I think are almost doomed and fated to be shallow and why do we have our struggle even as we're having it here to break through to a place that we perhaps we should have
37:10 -  pain long before because we ourselves to one degree or another have been recruited and brought to the Lord on that basis I did not come to God because I was powerfully convicted that I was a sinner that conviction came after my
37:26 -  coming I was saved first and converted later whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but put what Jesus said to Peter when thou art converted go strengthen your brother and I believe that that conversion that
37:42 -  apostolic and profound turning of the whole life over to God no matter the consequence has everything to do with God as judge shattering self-discovery of his own presumption though all forsaken yet I
38:02 -  will not that assertion that I will and they can see the heart that thinks it will follow land with us where we go they even lay aside so meager the vanity that had to be shattered and broken so the real God is the one who
38:27 -  reveals himself knowledge of guilt the personality of God than the reality of revelation belong together the scripture itself attest to that point in verse 16 of Psalm 9 the Lord is known by the judgment which he executes was it say
38:45 -  when the judgments of God are in the earth the world will know righteousness that there's a corroboration a linkage an inexorable connection between judgment and knowing God the Lord is known by the judgment which he executes he's
39:03 -  really known you may have had some soppy notion of him as some Casper milk toast as some buddy who's going to do your bidding the Jesus who'll get you a boyfriend girlfriend and heal your marriage and and your finances an errand
39:18 -  boy but God as God as he really is his most deeply and truly and ultimately revealed in the judgment which he executes so if we have this seeing that in the Holocaust what have we missed if we have this seeing it in the
39:42 -  crucifixion of Jesus what have we missed what the crucifixion is anything it's the statement of the God who executes judgment even upon himself what is revealed here is clear he is a moral God he hates in an unrighteousness and that
40:03 -  in his love for his creation though his patients belong he will not always indulge it on the contrary would be a blemish on the divine character if judgment were absent for God would be less than moral let alone holy were he
40:17 -  indifferent to sin and injustice we may be a soft touch we may look the other way we may not have a stomach to bring judgment which is to say correct correction or chastisement to our own children or to those in our own
40:33 -  congregations but God is not a soft touch and I praise God for that another theologian Langdon Gilkey comments the judgment of God on what is alien to himself will be an essential part of the relation of the rule of God to every
40:53 -  period of history for no society in history is the kingdom and realization of this is an essential part of every society's health just to paraphrase him that society itself even secular society needs to see the judgments of God in its
41:10 -  own history we ourselves could not tolerate nor survive a comparable indifference to wrong in our society shall we expect less from God than we
41:27 -  would from man as the expulsion from Eden the flood Sodom and Gomorrah the destruction of the Canaanites indicate judgment as God's purgative for his creation when every other recourse is exhausted if we see the necessity for
41:44 -  judgment with criminals malifactors that that society's order requires that kind of judgment how much more creation with judgment as God's purgative when every other recourse is exhausted that's summed up in the statement and when the
42:05 -  gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed to all nations then shall the income how did how did that proclamation begin with with the ministry of John the Baptist and Jesus himself repent for the kingdom of heaven
42:20 -  is at hand the very first message struck in the gospel is the message of repentance that precedes a coming kingdom and repentance for sin to avoid the judgment that must fall the sense of the universality and depth of warping
42:40 -  and corruption of sin is the presupposition for the universality and completeness of this impending judgment that's that same theologian talking not me this is back to my statement indeed
42:58 -  what would be the meaning of mercy except to be understood in the context of his judgments how can we even talk about mercy except we see it in the context of judgment mercy does not mean anything independent of judgment neither
43:12 -  does goodness independent of severity Paul says in Romans 11 behold the severity and the goodness of God he puts them both together you cannot behold the goodness of God independence of the severity it's no longer goodness it's a
43:26 -  saccharine sentimental lie his goodness is only goodness in the light of the severity and his mercy is only mercy in the light of his judgment this is critical for us to know because God is going to look to us to extend mercy to
43:45 -  and of all of all that we have is some kind of truncated wishy-washy equivalent that bears that word but is not really a true conviction of mercy we'll have nothing to give and you know how we will know mercy by the judgments that either
44:01 -  have come to us or but or that we have been spared which we have which we fully deserve that that God in his mercy has requited our dear Saints can you see what God was crying at the last night deep calling unto deep more than
44:18 -  more than a mystical experience I cherish his touch I cherish those experiences but God forgive us for our phraseological Christianity God forgive us for our verbalisms God forgive us for being content with doctrines that are
44:34 -  correct but are not palpitating that we do not do not know mercy as mercy we do not do not know righteousness as righteousness we do not know love as love because we do not know judgment and wants least to consider the evident love
44:54 -  lack of love toward God exhibited by professing professing Christians seems to indicate that we have failed and what Bruna would have us most urgently to note back to Bruna quoting him forgiveness would have to be imparted in
45:07 -  such a way that the holiness of God the inviolability of the law and the logical demands of the penal order would still be maintained thus the perfect revelation of forgiveness can only be such as brings out with intense emphasis that it
45:22 -  cannot and must not be taken for granted this means that it must be of such a kind that it will express the reality of guilt the reality of the divine wrath and yet at the same time the overwhelming reality of forgiving love I'm glad that
45:39 -  this is on tape don't strain or think that you have to get it in the first hearing it's a choice statement you know what I think of as I read this the difference between our Billy Graham type of evangelisms with making decisions
45:52 -  with all respect and for example an evangelist like Finney when you read the accounts of the revivals which came through Finney men writhe and groaned for days on end before they broke through to joy unspeakable and full of
46:11 -  glory and Finney was not quick to alleviate their discomfort it all didn't have to be attended in one service I don't know how many times have been criticized for allowing a message to end and not giving people the punchline and
46:28 -  and that somehow they couldn't have it all in one message that they have to go home in a tension of of irresolution what are the patchy generation we are it's all going to be packaged and tied up with a pretty bow in one hearing that
46:44 -  everybody can go home happy well let him go home wretched let them go home agitated let them go home wrecked up Finney was not quick to bring a false comfort he let God have his full work of conviction we haven't seen anything like
47:04 -  it in our generation men held on to the pillars of the building where he spoke for they felt sure that the floor was opening and they were going to swallow it up into an eternal fire people were carried out of meetings groaning and
47:22 -  agonizing and rise through the night and went on like that for for two or three days till finally broke home the mercy of God in the salvation of God that has saved me out of an eternal death and I'll tell you those people were not just
47:39 -  they were saved to the uttermost no wonder that the that the bars and the saloons and the jails everything was emptied whole communities were transformed by the power of God because he let God have his full work because he
47:54 -  went out into the woods and groaned before he preached because he sent in advance men of prayer and intercession who spent weeks in the communities to which he came before he came for the ministry when you think of our present
48:09 -  evangelism and ministry I don't know if I have it here if I if I do forgive me for repeating myself but I know my own experience you come into town you step off the plane you're greeted you take it to motel you wash your face you throw
48:21 -  your clothes on you you're up on a platform you're speaking we wouldn't expect out of an athlete without toning himself up and warming himself up and getting ready but we expect that a message is going to come you know quick
48:35 -  now this is if we don't really believe that eternities at stake the reality of the divine wrath and at the same time the overwhelming reality
48:52 -  of forgiving love can we know the one without the other are we willing to make it known how'd you like to speak about the reality of the divine wrath and see how
49:10 -  many pulpits will be open to you and how many invitations you'll receive if you speak about the divine wrath and maybe not speak about the divine love in the same message let them go home with the divine wrath and chew on that and come
49:26 -  back later for the other part if indeed you're to give the other part at all amazing grace is a hymn sung to God who has not blithely dismissed the offense but bore it in himself but what is that offense for to miss that is to miss all
49:42 -  what is the heart of the psalmist's anguish in the in the cry against thee and thee only have I sinned Bruner comments to one who speaks plus there can never be any idea that this injury can be repaired by doing better next
49:58 -  time it is an injury which no ethical means can ever heal it is an injury done to the divine person himself wherever these points are regarded as serious the living personal character of God and sin there men speak of the wrath
50:15 -  of God and I think that the greatest visual lesson for us about God's wrath and the horror of sin the exceeding sinfulness of sin is the crucifixion of Jesus the
50:37 -  tremendous of tremendous the devastation of God marred more than any man he took his credit our transgressions upon himself he was made sin for every man and what that looks like on the cross what that battered pitiful spectacle
50:56 -  speaks is the statement of what sin is as it needs to be judged to sentimentalize that to defuse that to soften that to golem that with roses is to rob us of the meaning of sin of the wrath and judgment of God but also of the love of
51:19 -  God whose mercy saves us out of having to have borne that for ourselves we can't miss the tremendous where the tremendous is the statement both of the wrath and of the love of God and isn't it ironic that the two great events of
51:40 -  modern history the tremendous of the crucifixion of Jesus and that of the crucifixion of Jewish people have both been lost not understood somehow transmuted the sting is taken away like like what Germany has done with that
52:00 -  how as I described to you it's still there you can still visit there's still a a barrack to be seen according to specifications but it's not those that existed in the time of horror it's nicely landscaped with stones and
52:20 -  garlanded and wreaths and memorials like we went to Bergen Wilson Juergen and the precious Saints there from Godson Hanover but it's antiseptic there were the monuments there are the statements they tell you how many how many bodies
52:36 -  are in this mass grave 5,000 you know that what's her name who died from Holland the Jewish girl and Frank died there and her sister somewhere in those mass graves when you can walk through it then you're not haunted you're not
52:55 -  pierced through there's something about us that covers over and because we don't want to consider judgment the Bible in the literature primitive Christianity do not say a great deal about this Brune adds because at that time the moral
53:13 -  sense of guilt was so strong that the idea of punishment and expiation was unquestioned for us it is not so for the guilt the sense of guilt among contemporary humanity is as one WAN week as the sense for the need of
53:30 -  repentance that interesting the two things go together that the early of biblical generation did not have to be made it did not have to be instructed in this I think I quoted one time FB Myers statement about Abraham taking
53:45 -  Isaac to Mount Moriah he said Abraham knowing the terror of God rose up early in the morning and startled his ass no gifts no hands no butts he didn't quibble with God there was something instinctive in his Abrahamic heart that sensed that
54:02 -  the that the great God who alone is holy and righteous somehow man being what he is something needs to be expiated something needs to be atoned for some something by sacrifice and shedding of blood it was intuitive it was
54:19 -  understood but our generation has been so blunted by deception that we don't understand we don't have a sense of guilt and we don't have a need for repentance but the two things are linked yet it is precisely that awareness that
54:34 -  is so critical for the consciousness of guilt is the point of insertion for revelation the revelation of the cross the meaning is relative to the repentance of the one who considers it that the gate to revelation is repentance
55:00 -  not looking for sermon illustrations or a great message that if revelation is withheld probably of this or anything but what is wanting is the place of brokenness and repentance and not for our boo-boos for what we have done or
55:21 -  failed to have done but what we in our humanity are just those who know that their iniquity is ever before them Paul argues in Romans that the very instinct of nature teaches men about the moral law that it is written in their hearts
55:38 -  their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts ultimately accusing or else defending themselves I'm just reading Woody Allen last night I had trouble falling asleep I know about you guys I could not fall asleep there was
55:53 -  something like an energy that was just alive in me I could not fall asleep so I just I read the letter maybe one o'clock and the last thing I read was Woody Allen someone gave me the recent time magazine being interviewed by a
56:07 -  reporter about his relationship sexual relationship with the daughter of his common-law wife and how he defended himself the guy comes out smelling like a rose I mean he has such a view of himself he has such an ability to
56:25 -  justify and to rationalize and that's what Paul said their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending themselves so we can suggest that judgment is not only an inwardly necessary consequence
56:41 -  of the sin of mankind but is organically intrinsic to very life and reality Woody Allen is deceived that this issue of judgment and guilt and sin is that the very foundation of reality itself and to lack that as a foundation is to
57:05 -  be condemned to a deception about everything even mute creation celebrates the intrinsic rightness of judgment Psalm 98 verses 7 & 8 let the sea roar and all that contains the world and those who
57:25 -  dwell in it let the rivers clap their hands let the mountains sing together for joy before the Lord for he is coming to judge the earth this is why they'd mentioned it before even new nature rejoices for the judgment of God
57:41 -  how embarrassing for us if we don't what shall be said then when judgment does not come and evil is not required in this lifetime or in history here I would suggest is one of the most persuasive arguments for eternity itself it's very
57:59 -  logic presupposes eternity actually heightens the issue of eternity and hence the moral content of this life seeing that the perpetrators of evil so often escape their just recompense in this lifetime
58:15 -  if there's evil in the world and it's not being judged in this life that in itself is the most cogent and persuasive argument for eternity because judgment is intrinsic there's a divine logic that evil must be judged and if
58:37 -  it will not be judged in this lifetime if those drug kings those cartels in Colombia who are massing billions and and shooting up lawyers and and judges and to enforce their their rule by which they they they make themselves their
58:52 -  billions if those guys can get in and out of jail or escape judgment in this life what more cogent statement that there must be any I don't care if you've never been to Bible school if you've never heard of scripture something in
59:11 -  very nature itself itself that that group creation recognizes must be communicated to the dollar soul hey if this guy has gotten away with it in this life there must be something after this life by which that has got to be called
59:27 -  for so judgment even implies eternity to those who are not even biblically oriented has there not been in the intuitive gut of mankind a deep inward sense of a recompense that must come that there is a God who is not mocked
59:52 -  that all that is is somehow organically that is organically right demands it then our very instinct as human beings sense that there's got to be a payoff by such an instinctive reckoning eternity is brought into time especially
01:00:11 -  for those whose perception of reality is not set in biblical terms who themselves would have no occasion to fear what am I what am I saying here that for those who are not directly reached by the gospel have no interest
01:00:25 -  in hearing it or even sidestepped the very existence of evil in the world God will hold them accountable for the acknowledgement that there's an evil that implies a judgment if not in this world in a world to come and that
01:00:41 -  therefore there's an eternity and that therefore there's an eternal God with whom we have to do can you see that whether they hear the gospel that they won't hear it the very way in which reality itself is structured in terms of
01:00:56 -  evil that deserves judgment implies an eternity which that will take place and therefore holds every man who has lived in this world accountable before the God of that eternity that's that's how great an issue judgment is something intuitive
01:01:14 -  in mankind recognizes the necessity for it what about the calamities that punctuate this life are they to be dismissed as accident near mishap in advertent circumstance what is frequently not recognized by many are
01:01:27 -  the preliminary judgments of God intended as a foretaste and warning of a greater and eternal to come if these are not heeded unto repentance that's why I love her phrase eternal preliminary judgment when the Lord gave
01:01:43 -  me a message on priesthood and I spoke it for the first time a few years ago in Arizona some of the Sisters of Mary who live in Phoenix came and I remember one saying when did you get this message I think about November the Lord
01:01:59 -  began to speak to me of a piece of that's exactly when that's a new shrink was touched by the same thing and uses the phrase preliminary judgment would do us well to see what's going on in Yugoslavia the hurricane in Florida the
01:02:18 -  earthquakes in California the social and violent upheaval in the Balkans the fragmentation of Eastern Europe the uprise of neo-nazis and Jesus freaks and the onslaught against minorities and other ethnic groups and races are all
01:02:38 -  already preliminary judgments of God it's already a hell that's beginning to be evidenced even while it while we're yet on earth okay in this sense such judgments are already a mercy if our acts were without such consequence well
01:02:58 -  why would we cease from that which is already detrimental to proper living God is encouraging us by indicating preliminary judgment that would give us cause now to change our ways before a final judgment comes it's painful to see
01:03:17 -  what's happening in those places the devastation that has come by that hurricane followed immediately by looting the riot in LA with looting it's God's mercy to save us from a course that would bring us into an eternal
01:03:36 -  judgment in which the fires are not quenched so Lord we just thank you precious God that you're not willing that we should finish these weeks without giving us a second opportunity to contemplate what is so central to
01:03:55 -  your own Constitution as God and Lord we acknowledge that we're soft that we don't like to consider such things that they're painful but God forbid that we do not see as you see particularly if we purport to have a prophetic calling that
01:04:13 -  will turn men again to God in true turning so give us my God a breather and bring us back for the completion of this and we ask that you do something permanent you put something in us that will not be dislodged not dissipate away
01:04:30 -  that will affect every category of our understanding our speech our calling our ministry and our service to save them from perishing who otherwise would have perished had they not heard bless us that we might bless them in Jesus name we pray
01:04:48 -  and about our own ability as the church to discern the meaning of things that are calamities accidents social upheavals disturbances in nature and often we take a time magazine Newsweek mentality and look upon it horizontally and explain it
01:05:15 -  naturally our first disposition is not to consider a natural calamity as judgment the same thing it issues out of our life we break our leg our marriage fails our church erupts or whatever it is the first disposition is not to consider that as a
01:05:36 -  judgment we always look for a natural explanation so if that's the that's the disposition of the church what shall we expect of the world that does not rightly interpret its own experience in the nations she writes specially a slink talking about Nineveh
01:06:02 -  how Nineveh repented an unregenerate nation had no knowledge of God and yet the very warning of brought about such a radical repentance for every creature not only man but animals themselves a real putting out of sackcloth and God deterred his anger because of that response merely at
01:06:23 -  the message of judgment so Nineveh that heathen city repented but we do not repent even as a church how we Christians thereby make ourselves equally guilty with others yes we do we do we not even provoke God's judgments when we believers as were the Christians in devastated Europe when
01:06:46 -  one city was after another was laid in ruins are continually wrapped up in everything worldly and without further thought attend concerts the theater the movies social functions and continue to live our old pleasure-seeking lives as though God were not judging us are we not with such
01:07:05 -  behavior scoffing at the judgments of God this is a remarkable statement that our conduct contradicts and belies that what has been happening in time and history is the judgment of God the fact that we can go on to the movies life as usual business as usual in the pursuit of our
01:07:28 -  pleasure is a direct contradiction of the event as being a judgment you understand that our conduct betrays our mentality how do we go on with the frivolous and the social and the lighthearted things and the pleasures as if what had happened was not a statement from God and if that's the
01:07:49 -  way the church conducts itself what shall we hope for in the world they look at us and our conduct reveals how we ourselves view the realities of life and even such calamities as war I think I mentioned that the great heaps of rubble in Munich are today the skiing slopes of the now
01:08:15 -  generation all dressed up in their resplendent ski outfits and bindings and shoes and are going up to the Teufelberger Bergen for skiing forgetting or not having even known that those mountains was the statement of God's judgment on Germany and now become itself the place of pleasure where's
01:08:39 -  the church in Germany to have indicated them it's up there skiing with them thank you when the church of Jesus is so engrossed in the world and so wrapped up in the love of the world it is clear that no fervent priestly supplications can or will be made to avert God's future judgments if
01:09:00 -  we have not learned from the reality of the past ones how are we his priestly intercessors to avert future judgments if we're up there skiing with the pleasure seekers that can only ensue when in times of God's judgments a certain fasting and abstinence from worldly pleasure takes place only
01:09:21 -  then has God's wrath really cut us to the quick only then can we sorrow in priestly love with all the suffering the prisoners the hungry the homeless with our whole nation when God has to strike it so severely it's not a fasting necessarily a food though that could be good but a fasting from
01:09:41 -  abstinence of the world's pleasures only then can God's wrath really cut us to the quick we insulate we dull ourselves from understanding and feeling the pang of what God is required to do among nations because we're indulging ourselves in their pleasures and it nullifies our capacity
01:10:04 -  either to interpret to bear the grief of it and to warn them of future judgments I told you how in a conference at Osaka in Japan why are you always telling yours to hers I wish I had other things that I said something about the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki I said you
01:10:26 -  would be making a mistake to attribute that to military and political policies determined by men it more rightly needs to be seen as a preliminary judgment from God to save the nation from a greater and eternal catastrophe which would be without remedy because I'm saying this to you now
01:10:47 -  conversationally when I said it then it was under the anointing of God with such power and such authority and that a man leaped up a minister as a minister's conference and cried up God he said make me a prophet for my nation I'll never forget that cry that my nation has not rightly interpreted
01:11:07 -  its own past calamities and therefore is on a headlong headlong course for future catastrophe that is eternal and without remedy make me a prophet what does he mean by that that I might speak to my own nation to interpret rightly its past that it might be saved from the devastations
01:11:25 -  of the future how come that they that the church in Japan had not seen that before according to Basil Leishling it's because the church in Japan and everywhere and Germany itself is so quick to go back to business as usual and pleasure as usual that dulls it both to rightly
01:11:45 -  understand interpret and to speak the meaning of the recent history to the nation and to speak of the thing that is future if we will not learn from the past judgment which is preliminary what is it preliminary to a future final irrevocable
01:12:04 -  and irremediable judgment God is looking to us for priests who will step into the breach breach and repent for themselves for judgment begins at the house of God and for others but our ears have become deaf because we love the world and our hearts are hot and insensitive
01:12:25 -  to God's judgments we can't even recognize them when they come upon ourselves well it was an accident it was a slippery road the car went off into a ditch or I broke my knee or when our first question should have been what is God saying
01:12:43 -  what is he implying by this for what is he wanting to draw my attention did not the judgments of the past tell us how great God's anger is and we haven't learned by that even though even the biblical statements about God's judgment are lost
01:13:06 -  to us does not what is now happening in the world remind us constantly that our sins must have reached the peak if God the Lord who loved us so much that he gave his only begotten son must punish so severely and as I said before to look upon that as the judgment of God
01:13:29 -  that that's the statement of his wrath that's the statement of his assessment of sin is a key to understanding old judgment if that is blurred for us that has become sentimentalized for us if that's only a doctrine for us if that's only an atonement thing by which
01:13:45 -  we're saved from sin and brought healing and eternal life and not understood it as the statement of judgment on sin we have missed one of the greatest and most costly provisions of God provisions of God to instruct us
01:14:07 -  how we must have provoked the wrath of God how great must thou sins be that this dot of love sent and must still send such harsh judgments how it must grieve God to see large cities in our land and elsewhere laid in ruins every judgment that God permits to come upon us accuses us
01:14:24 -  yet the Christians live as before in love with the world and with self indifferent to the need and so bypass their responsibility judgments are already a mercy for if our acts were without such consequence why would we cease from
01:14:44 -  them that judgment which is already a painful censure arising out of improper living instructs us to amend or change our ways to avoid further and future harm or carry the consequence irremediably into eternity sorry about this writing that the preliminary judgments of God
01:15:05 -  are to stop our course lest we carry the full thing not only suffering the consequence in time the wages of sin is death in time but carry it also into eternity whatsoever a man's sin whatsoever a man soweth that to shall he reap it's a grace foundational to the very structure
01:15:26 -  of reality as a law of life to be spared what is the painful consequence of our sins would do the service to do to the service to our humanity by removing the very spur that affects our true personhood and making choices and decisions in the light of it you've got to be painful consequence
01:15:46 -  for transgression and sin it's a grace and a mercy where it teaches us to make a right decision in the light of that pain that alters our course both in time and for eternity and the same principle is true for nations and for Israel God's judgments that are not only
01:16:04 -  punitive but also redemptive and are intended as salutary healthy for both the individual and the corporate life the failure to be instructed unto remorse and repentance further compounds the sin and its consequences ultimately persistent rejection of judgment as judgment eventuates
01:16:24 -  in a heartening compelling yet severe dealings from God which if spurned leaves the sinner without eternal recourse i can't think of a single statement that has more to say about the holocaust than that why the holocaust because previous attempts by God to arrest the attention of the
01:16:43 -  nation throughout its whole diaspora history was spurned not understood as judgment attributed to men and therefore finally there's a summing up in which that persistent rejection of judgment as judgment brings about a certain heartening and compels yet a severe dealing from God
01:17:08 -  and if that dealing is spurned it leaves the sinner or the sinful nation without eternal recourse from the standpoint of those indifferent to truth and insensible even to their own immediate well-being what greater mercy than fear as an incentive toward right living
01:17:27 -  oh generation of vipers john the baptist exclaimed who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come the fear of eternal judgment frequently reiterated in scripture as the day of the lord the day of wrath is a merciful provision of warning to those who would otherwise have been taken unawares
01:17:44 -  you know what people say are you trying to scare me what is this hell and brimstone and brimstone does God have to scare me into the kingdom where you've done sap if you'll not come for the love of truth and the pleading of God then come out of fear but come
01:18:06 -  it's your stupidity and your hardness of heart that requires fear to be the last possible motivation by which you could be spared a judgment for which would otherwise be indifferent so don't let anybody steal your thunder and say were you you're trying to scare me
01:18:27 -  is that all you can do is play upon my fear well if that's the condition in which you are that nothing else but fear will move you toward a right relationship with God then yes i'm trying to scare you God himself speaks of these things in scripture for that very reason the day of the
01:18:43 -  lord must come a day of wrath a fearful destruction who can stand it men will cry out for clefs and in the mountains to hide them and rocks to fall upon them to save them from the face of the wrath of the lamp who comes knowing these things Paul said i persuade men knowing the terror of these
01:19:01 -  things the fear of eternal judgment is a merciful provision of warning to those who would otherwise be taken unawares and perish how many of our present and insoluble world crises such as terrorism venereal disease global violence ecological disaster not susceptible to control
01:19:24 -  let alone elimination would have had as they're deterring the fear of eternal judgment here's a choice statement we're unable to control let alone eliminate aids global violence terrorism other disasters which might have been deterred if they had had fear as their motivation
01:19:49 -  but what homosexual who has aids is is fearful of communicating it to others he doesn't give a cotton picking rap so long as he gets his satisfaction or even inflicts his spike on a civilization of society that he thinks has failed him because they should have found an answer by
01:20:10 -  now why aren't they giving billions to research and save us from the from being victims of aids when God says it's the logical consequence of your own sin those people will bite you spit at you and do anything to communicate their disease to you because they don't have any regard for the fact
01:20:30 -  that not only will they pay a consequence in this life but that they will suffer an eternal judgment here's what i'm saying eternal judgment and the fear of it is God's provision against aids venereal diseases violence terrorism death murder mayhem brutality incest rape
01:20:51 -  and that all these things are becoming pandemic sweeping civilization and breaking through every statistic of times past is a statement to the absence of the fear of God and of his judgment eternally if society will not judge men in the here and now what about the fear of standing
01:21:11 -  before the judge in that day that would have served as a counteractive pressure to cease from their sin and from their violence and from the evil we can almost say that the eruption of all this vicious evil is a statement of the church's failure to make known
01:21:35 -  the eternal judgment of God we have balked we've not been comfortable with the subject i'll tell you what saints it's the most difficult of all to persuade men it's a laughing stock it's an absurdity ha ha ha if there's any cartoon most prolific in popular magazines it's a man
01:21:57 -  carrying a sandwich board that sign that says repent for the day of the lord is at hand there's nothing that is that is less susceptible to communication you might impress people with some other point about God but to impress them about the eternal
01:22:15 -  judgment of God is an ultimate requirement that not many saints or ministers are able to perform it is the test of where we are of whether we can effectively communicate that fear remember the word of God in your mouth is truth we might say it technically but unless it's truth
01:22:42 -  in our mouth truth in our hearts unless we know the terror of God we cannot persuade men and i don't know if i say it here but elsewhere finney warned that the day that would come with the evangelical church will have lost its fear of hell it will have rendered itself
01:23:03 -  of no effect in the purposes of God toward the unsaved the fear of eternal judgment is foundational to the church's whole message to the church's whole character as church and it's not known to us because we're going to the movies and enjoying ourselves and taking
01:23:24 -  our pleasure while these judgments are erupting everywhere in the world and we live blithely as if they're not happening or they do not mean judgment but are just social accidents or geological disturbances that that say nothing from God our conduct contradicts that they are
01:23:44 -  judgments it's almost like the culture has become so hardened with these what would be false alarms but the day the lord in the fifth century bc was even then at hand and there's a an existential work that God has to bring near to make imminent and immediate the judgments of that great day
01:24:13 -  to fit men for it in the day of their visitation so it's a tremendous confusion to only understand imminence and the threat of judgment as in chronological terms it's a good error today good all right this was imminent in the consciousness of the apostles i just challenge you to go through
01:24:34 -  the letters of peter especially and Paul about the day of the wrath the day of the lord the day of judgment the day the day the day figures prominently in all their consideration Paul summed up his message to the facelonian pagans i think i have it here in this paper that you
01:24:50 -  were saved uh that you were turned from your idols to serve the living God and to wait for Jesus who saves you from the day of his wrath they rejoice for that salvation why why did 3000 come to the lord on the day of pentecost because peter said this is that this is that
01:25:11 -  which was spoken of by the prophet joe that the moon would be turned to blood and the sky would be dark and and it began to reiterate prophetic statements that they knew that spoke of the day of the lord so that they interpreted the the events of pentecost as introduced in that day
01:25:30 -  when they said what must we be due to do to be saved they didn't use the word then as we know it now what they were talking about was what must we be what must we do to be saved from the judgment to come it's that to do it this is that how
01:25:58 -  it really is anything because of the fact of the restriction and the judgment that comes on their own sin same with parents or children with parents to hate that kind of restriction that doesn't prevent them from just being free to do whatever they want and commit anything they want
