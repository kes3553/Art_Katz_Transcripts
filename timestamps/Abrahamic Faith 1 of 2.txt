Abrahamic Faith 1 of 2

00:00 -  It's a great opportunity to look at Genesis 15. It's remarkable how terse, T-E-R-S-E, the scriptures are. We never cease to marvel at how much can be said in so few words, just contrary to the whole spirit of the world whose mouth is always running off.
00:34 -  That the volume of the world speaking far exceeds its content. So here's one episode in the life of Abraham. But it's a critical episode. Maybe we can say that everything that has taken place with Abraham from Genesis chapter 12 was preparation for what is going to be performed in 15.
00:59 -  And everything that follows is the result of it. And if that's not true, I think it is true that it's a good way to perceive things. Everything from now has been preparation. Everything from now, issues from this moment, has its significance because of it.
01:23 -  I've never quite seen it or said that like that before. It's a good way to perceive reality itself. Have you ever said that? Everything from now has been preparation. There's a certain significance to now as it will affect all the future. What a wonderful way to perceive life.
01:42 -  Well, Abraham has just come back from a victory over the kings of Sodom. He has rescued his nephew Lot and has refused the reward that was offered him by the earthly king. It says in chapter 14, verse 22, I have sworn to the Lord God, most high possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread or a sandal,
02:14 -  a fong or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abraham rich. Oh, how can you not help but love this man? These are not puppets or automatons, mechanical pieces of humanity, and God is merely moving chess pieces on a board. These are flesh and blood men, and of whom the world is not worthy.
02:39 -  And it says the eye of God rose to and fro over the face of the earth, seeking the heart of that one, to reveal himself to that one whose heart is turned toward him. It shows that though God is sovereign, there is a profound, immeasurably profound place for human freedom and response toward God. In fact, I would say the freedom to respond to God is the essential freedom that makes man man.
03:11 -  This is the heart of what is at our humanity. We're not automatons, we're not puppets, we're not being jerked. There's not a God who is working out his spectacular will despite us.
03:24 -  It's a God who is so great, he's working out a spectacular will through us, and a freedom in which we yield to his will and give ourselves. So it's a remarkable drama.
03:41 -  And Abraham was called. He could have turned a deaf ear to that call. I can remember one instance to my eternal embarrassment.
03:51 -  I was very young in the faith, only months old, washing the dishes in my little one-room apartment in Oakland, California, having just come back from the crib in which I had found the Lord. And the voice said, Arthur, and I kept doing the dishes.
04:08 -  And a few months later, Arthur, and I kept doing the dishes. I had never turned to ask. I just could not believe, I had not the faith yet to believe that I was being addressed by God.
04:23 -  Just to recover myself through another episode since, with what has been, his voice has been yet more still and small than I have heard and turned and asked. So the whole of our faith begins with God's call to a man, Abraham.
04:40 -  And if we had the time, I could go back and see the origin of that call and how it comes right on the heels of the colossal rebellion of nations in Genesis 10, who were moving eastward at their own volition and seeking to establish themselves
04:58 -  and to raise their power of Babel and to reach into the heavens. It has all of the elements that constitutes the last day's world system, the unification, the ecumenical, political, religious combination of men who want to be as God.
05:18 -  What was at the beginning will be also at the end. And God brought that attempt down by confusing languages and dispersing them over the earth, as he will also bring the last days rebellion down as well.
05:32 -  And then the call to Abraham. The nations have failed. They've rebelled against God. They refuse to recognize his program, his plan.
05:45 -  And then God establishes his plan by the call of one man who becomes the father of faith, the father of Israel, and the nation central to all nations. Isn't that remarkable?
05:59 -  God's whole program, his whole theocratic design for creation comes with the call to one man. Resting on the ability of a man to hear God's voice in, so to speak, Babylon, in Colbia, in Ur. You are the city where Abraham lived.
06:26 -  In the midst of all of the idols and everything that was anti-God, one man heard his voice and was called out and came. He hesitated. He delayed. There was a significant delay. As you know, I'm just going to say I'm happy for that only in the sense I'm never happy for any disobedience to God.
06:46 -  And procrastination is disobedience. When Chapter 12 begins and let's take a look at that. So Abraham departed as the Lord has spoken in verse four.
07:07 -  But it's much later than when God's first call came because the Lord had said to Abraham, get thee out of your country and from your kindred in your father's house. But we know that when he did go, it was not from Ur of the Colbis, but from Haran,
07:25 -  which which word means delay, that instead of leaving his father's house, he took his father with him. Instead of leaving his kindred, he took his mishpacha. He took God. So in a word, it's a disappointment and it's an encouragement.
07:43 -  We would love to have seen pure obedience to God in the moment of this call. We see his delay and a mixed obedience. Couldn't bring himself to a whole coming out. He lingered.
07:58 -  In fact, Haran is alongside the same river where Ur of the Colbis was. You need to understand the power of rivers in the Fertile Crescent and the river civilizations of Mesopotamia. Everything, not just economy, but culture rested on river.
08:17 -  They were river civilizations, their commerce, their trade, their significance. Everything rested on the flow of rivers. But when you come into the land, there's no river of any significance at all.
08:31 -  You say, what about Jordan? Enormously significant spiritually, but in terms of being a Nile or a Tigris or Euphrates, whose rise and fall and fluvia, what do you call it?
08:44 -  That brings the prime soil zero. When you come into the land, you don't look down at rivers for your economic well-being. You look up to heaven, from whence cometh the early rain and the latter rain.
08:59 -  And even that is not just a matter of fixed rhythm of nature, but in response and obedience to the God of having who stands it and will withhold it in disobedience. See, the whole economy, the whole order of things profoundly changes when you cross over and come into the land.
09:21 -  The word Hebrew, Abraham is a Gentile by birth, just to encourage you guys around the table here. He became a Hebrew just like you by crossing over. And that's the very root of the meaning of the word Hebrew, one who crosses over.
09:43 -  And what a crossing over that is. You leave everything behind you, the whole pattern of life. And I think from all that scholars have been able to establish,
09:53 -  it wasn't as if Abraham was a man who had not much to lose. He had everything to lose. He was a man of substantial possession.
10:04 -  And they say that the homes of men of this class at this time was not lacking in anything that would bless people of solid middle class stature today. Hot and cold running water and maids and servants and all of the kinds of things that one would be loathe to leave behind.
10:25 -  And I can't think of a more profound description of the cross than to leave nation, kindred and father's house and follow me in the land that I will show you. Tremulous, uncertain, fearful, insecure.
10:43 -  To follow some nebulous God in a life, in a civilization that believed in many Gods. Who is this one now who speaks and says follow me? This is the living God.
10:56 -  This is the true God. And follow me in a land that I will show you. It requires an active, dynamic faith.
11:06 -  Everything is open and requires an intimacy and being cast upon God in dependency. Moment by moment, day by day, the land that I will show you. The call to Abraham is the cross.
11:23 -  Everything that's dear to men and their flesh. Nation, kindred and father's house. God says get thee out.
11:32 -  He says don't linger. Don't be partial all this in heaven to get thee out. It's the most radical call to separation.
11:43 -  It's nothing less than the cross. And the fact that Abraham could not bring himself to that totality and that he delays in the place in Iran and the delay was so long
11:54 -  that it says they gathered many souls there in much substance. It wasn't some overnight delay. It may well have been a matter of years.
12:02 -  In fact, what finally releases Abraham to be obedient to God's call is the death of his father, Terah, T-E-R-A-H, I think it is. Isn't it interesting how death is the key to life?
12:17 -  In the day that I saw the Lord, it was when King Uzziah died. I've always wondered what's in Isaiah 6. Is that a mere piece of chronological coincidence
12:31 -  or a significant release for Isaiah? In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord high and lifted up. In the day that Abraham's father died,
12:41 -  Abraham departed as his Lord had spoken unto him. And this is the father of faith, saints, and I love it. Do you know why?
12:51 -  Because he's no tin saint. He's flesh and blood like his way. He hesitates, he delays, he's a mixed bag.
12:59 -  He hears, but he doesn't hear. He comes, but he doesn't come. He drags his feet, he lingers, but he finally does come.
13:06 -  And so the patience of God to show us that... I'm not putting before you a model who's so lofty and so mystical, God's man of faith and power,
13:18 -  that you couldn't ever hope to attain to his virtuality. I'm showing you he's flesh and blood just as you. And I'll bring you as I brought him.
13:30 -  And we all know that his righteousness was not some intrinsic virtue that he possessed, but was imputed to him because of his faith.
13:41 -  And we're going to examine that in just a moment. So there's a long investment of God in Abram before chapter 15. God's covenantal call to Abram is already in chapter 12.
13:57 -  You will bless all the nations of the earth, all the families of the earth. The significance of what you're about and need is universal.
14:08 -  All nations will be affected by your obedience. How would you like that call? As a matter of fact, if you have not recognized
14:19 -  Abraham's call as your call, you're out of the faith. That is your call. And all nations will be affected by your obedience to it.
14:33 -  Hallelujah. So God has given Abram lavish promise. In you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
14:53 -  I will make you a great nation. Out of your progeny, out of your loins, out of your seed, all nations, all families of the earth will be blessed.
15:12 -  Okay, so after these things, all of our little introduction are these things that have preceded what is now going to take place.
15:23 -  After these things, and those things must proceed, there's a preparation, then there comes a moment, and it's that significant moment we want now to examine
15:33 -  because it has implications for all generations, particularly for the end and for the nation Israel that will spring out of Abram's loins.
15:44 -  After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying, isn't it remarkable everything is predicated upon the word?
15:55 -  It began with the word Abram, Abraham. Abraham comes later. When God asked the hen, that was not there originally,
16:07 -  which some commentators say was the very birth of God. He breathed into Abraham one syllable more. There was a difference between Abram and Abraham,
16:17 -  father of many nations. So it comes by the word. What is the word that came to him in a vision?
16:27 -  I'm going to read to you from this remarkable commentary by Cael and Dilich. I think Dilich is a Hebrew Christian commentator
16:39 -  of the 19th century, and it may well be a proof of what our mother in Israel, Marie, has told me frequently. She said, there's something given to you Jewish believers
16:52 -  that is unique and is not to be expected in those that are not Jewish. Namely, an insight into the word of God
16:59 -  and an ability in the proclaiming of it that is reserved for you alone. I hope it doesn't sound vain.
17:07 -  It's just confirmed by told and says, how much more when you shall be drafted back into your own root?
17:13 -  And you'll see that when I read from this man. Just like David Barron and the other great Christian commentators, it is superb
17:23 -  how he interprets this chapter. But first we'll see how stupefying this chapter is, how it defies interpretation and what he makes
17:32 -  of just this one beginning that the word of God came to Abraham in a vision. Not a dream, probably a daytime experience,
17:43 -  something like what happened to Peter when he had that vision in Joppa of the veil that came down before him.
17:51 -  But it raises interesting questions. God could have appeared to him in fact, but no, this comes in a vision
17:59 -  and there's a reason for everything. And we don't hear the reason that this commentator gives. But first you need to try and supply your own.
18:07 -  Don't ever turn directly to a commentary. First wrestle through yourself with as much as you're able yourself to draw
18:16 -  from the text. Read other versions of the same text. Ponder, weigh it in your spirit. And then after you've exhausted everything
18:27 -  in your own contemplations, meditation, then turn to see what God has given as insight to other gifted men. That's what we will do.
18:36 -  Okay, what is the word? Do not fear Abraham. Isn't that interesting? We're so preoccupied. I don't know of any previous prophetical school
18:45 -  that had greater prominence than this one. Maybe because we're in a more serious hour than previous schools.
18:53 -  And we're about something of greater significance and the enemy is raising up his specter and harassment. But there's been a real question of fear
19:02 -  that has come up in our discussion and prayer. And that the first thing that God says, do not fear Abraham.
19:11 -  It's not a suggestion, it's a commandment. And maybe the only antidote to fear is the word of God.
19:20 -  Because he says we should not be dumped. Though we may have every reason otherwise to fear. He says so. So what do we do after that?
19:32 -  The word has spoken. I think there's a great wisdom in that. Or else we would continually justify our fears.
19:41 -  The difference of luxury that we are free to indulge. God says it has nothing to do with circumstance or the opposition of the enemy
19:50 -  or any kind of dread thing of last days, turmoil, we're going to come through this age, the final hour of tribulation
19:59 -  and things that shall come upon the earth and men's hearts will fail them for fear. But for us, do not be afraid.
20:08 -  Why? Because I say so. I am a shield to you. He's not just speaking to Abraham.
20:15 -  He's speaking to the man who is the father of faith and it's the appropriate word for the seed of Abraham, the children of faith in every generation, especially the last.
20:24 -  I am a shield to you. I'll give you a white shadow. Nothing can touch you. You're under a halo.
20:33 -  The powers of the darkness can foam at the mouth and be perplexed and relish your destruction. Not a hair on your head, unless I allow it.
20:42 -  Remember what Jesus said to Pontius Pilate? He was a helpless piece of humanity. He'd already been knocked from pillar to post.
20:51 -  He was full of bruises and cuts and blood and up all the night between... He was in the house of Caiaphas
21:00 -  and now finally brought before this Roman authority. He was supposed to buckle and sag and plead for his earthly existence
21:09 -  and he was just perfectly calm and unperturbed, imperturbable. I am Pontius Pilate. Don't you know that I have the power
21:18 -  either to destroy you or to release you? You could do nothing against me except if we're given you from above.
21:27 -  Oh, hallelujah. Dear saints, we ought to walk through this world as humans, but certainly not coward
21:36 -  with fear or intimidation, but as men and women who are under the divine protection of the same God who protected Abraham
21:45 -  and protects all the children of Abraham in every generation. And yet allows is marvelous. Allows. And when we turn to Revelation 13-7, it says,
21:54 -  And it was given to him, the Antichrist, to make war against the saints and to overcome them. The choice, saints of whom the world is not worthy,
22:03 -  to suffer and to die at the hands of Antichrist? Yes. It is serving an ultimate purpose. But it is not the outworking
22:12 -  of the powers of darkness in their own ability. It was given unto him. Right. Yes.
22:21 -  Nothing except to come down from above. That's a precious confidence. And I don't think it will come down until
22:30 -  the purposes for our being have been fulfilled. Let's say, David served his generation and fell asleep.
22:39 -  I occasionally pray that, Lord, let me serve my generation in the same Davidic heart and purity
22:48 -  and fullness, and then let me fall asleep. But let nothing remain undone or unattended that you haven't designed
22:57 -  and intended for me. However small, whatever little place in your vineyard, let the full outworking of it be performed
23:06 -  and then take me. However, it doesn't matter. Be confident of that.
23:15 -  I am a shield to you. Your reward shall be very great. Boy, I tell you, if there's ever any free statement, free sentences that are appropriate for saints
23:24 -  of the last days who are the seed of Abraham, it is these three. Just to encourage your hearts,
23:33 -  I have not rehearsed any of this. I didn't think to myself, well, first I'll take apart the statement that the devil exists. Nothing.
23:42 -  It's just happening. This is what God is wanting us to seem to understand. This is the timeless and eternal counsel of God
23:51 -  for the seed of Abraham in all generations and especially the last. Three great statements. Don't be afraid.
24:00 -  I am a shield to you. If you've got a shield like that, what can penetrate it? And your reward shall be very great.
24:09 -  Hallelujah. I'm always inviting people to my mansion in heaven.
24:18 -  I have not seen, you have not heard. And I'm not a glutton for the luxurious luxury, but there's a treasure being laid up.
24:27 -  There's reward, there's honor of an eternal kind. And we will say, it was worth it all. Every privation, every humiliation, every rebuke,
24:36 -  every unjust act toward us, every physical suffering is a reward, a very great reward. And the peculiar nature of the Church
24:45 -  is unlike any other entity in the world, it is a people who can give themselves full bore in total consecration and commitment
24:54 -  in giving this to God now in anticipation of reward that comes to them. There's nothing like that in the world.
25:03 -  The world always has to give us reward now. Fame, fortune, opportunity. Your name, your reputation.
25:12 -  You'll do this, you'll get this. You'll be on the Riviera, you'll get a car, you'll marry a girl.
25:21 -  This is the now generation wants its gratification now. Unlike that, only the Church, the true Church, can serve God totally without any anticipation
25:30 -  of its compensation coming now. Its great reward comes after. But it will come because God has spoken.
25:39 -  And rewards are not something to be disregarded. I didn't watch any bit of it, but we just have finished with the Olympics
25:48 -  and boy, did you read the preparations these athletes go through? I mean, it makes the generation of the 1936 Olympics
25:57 -  in Berlin look like a Boy Scout outing. This is scientific. This is almost all cultic.
26:06 -  How they prepare not only the bodies, but the minds of these athletes and their inward attitudes and what they believe and they get them all revved up
26:15 -  and the exercises, the diets. They have counselors that are professional just for their morale.
26:24 -  And they shave their heads and they've got costumes now that are made out of the most sophisticated fabrics One thousandth millimeter of a fraction of a second
26:33 -  which is the difference between victory and defeat. You cannot believe what is invested in running the race,
26:42 -  in obtaining the earthly reward. And what they're going to get now in millions in endorsements of products.
26:51 -  This girl who got four gold medals in swimming and she's already a culture hero and she's going to endorse this product and she'll have a fortune before she's 25.
27:01 -  That's the name of the game. That they give themselves for the reward now. And will all fade away and turn to dust.
27:10 -  Our reward is eternal and abiding. So Abram said, Oh Lord God,
27:22 -  what will thou give me since I am childless and the heir of my house is Eleazar of Damascus. Abram said,
27:31 -  Since thou hast given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir. Do you understand what is on Abram's heart?
27:40 -  Lord, you're making all these lavish promises. I'm going to be the father of many nations. But where's my progeny?
27:49 -  It's got to come from my body. Where's the son of promise that you're going to give me? I'm living with a woman who's never had any children
27:58 -  and I'm getting up there in years. And if you don't provide an offspring, this Eleazar, according to the understanding
28:07 -  of that time and generation, he will become the descendant. Now what would you say that this reveals
28:16 -  something selfish in Abram? Does he want the honor and distinction of himself giving forth the son that inherits these things?
28:25 -  Is he jealous for himself? No. He's really asking the things that pertain
28:34 -  to God's own glory. How can you make these lavish promises to me and I don't see any yet possible fulfillment
28:43 -  and the hope for it is fast fading away. If that's not the heart and essence of what it means to live in faith,
28:52 -  I don't know what it means. Haven't you experienced that? Sense of futility, if not desperation,
29:01 -  and where is God and where's the fulfillment of the very thing that he led you to expect? And the disappointment that comes.
29:10 -  So it's a classic episode of situation. He knows where offspring comes from. Thou hast given me no offspring.
29:20 -  And if offspring comes, Thou givest it. Because it doesn't come because I'm able to copulate and perform biologically
29:29 -  and it disperses over with the eggs and the blah blah. No, Thou givest.
29:38 -  Here's a man who knows the heart of cause and effect. It has nothing to do with nature.
29:47 -  That's only God's apparatus. It has to do with the God who gives. Thou hast not given.
29:56 -  And if you don't give, it doesn't come. And I'm not looking for it from any other source. I'm not going to take vitamins and become fertile
30:05 -  and do yoga and it's got to come from you. Can you see why God loves Abram?
30:14 -  And he saw that heart when Abram was in the oar of the Chaldees in the midst of idolatry. He saw the heart of that man.
30:23 -  His eye rose to and forth over the face of the earth seeking that one whose heart is perfect toward him. The fact that there's only one
30:32 -  manner of speaking, so few and that heart is revealed by Abram even in his question, even in his understanding.
30:41 -  Thou hast not given. Then behold the word of God came to him not to upbraid him, not to rebuke him
30:50 -  not to say you're way off the wall. He agrees with him. He understands Abram's framework of thinking and expectancy.
30:59 -  It's perfectly legitimate and says this man will not be your heir but one who shall come forth from your own body
31:08 -  he shall be your heir. And he took him outside and said now look toward the heavens and count the stars
31:17 -  if you're able to count them. And he said to him so shall your descendants be. He's talking to a man who's pushing a hundred
31:26 -  past any biological age of producing children with a wife that has been barren all her life long.
31:35 -  What does it say in Romans? Abraham hoped against hope. When all basis for human hope was gone
31:44 -  Abraham continued to hope against hope. Looking upon his body now as good as dead Abraham hoped against hope.
31:53 -  Was it just a circumstance that he had a wife who was barren? No.
32:02 -  The superb details of God that the whole Abrahamic faith has to have its origin out of
32:11 -  human hopelessness. No confidence in the flesh at all.
32:21 -  In all that is barren weak, despairing all the more heightened
32:30 -  by the lavish promises that God gives that you will bless all the families of the earth that makes you
32:39 -  all the more conscious of your frailty of your inadequacy, of your terrible humanity and emptiness.
32:48 -  We wouldn't be so conscious of it if we had not so great a call. So there's the conjunction of the great call
32:57 -  with our body as good as dead that is the very nexus of the way of God
33:06 -  in the earth and God's answer to the rebellion of nations described in Genesis 10 who wanted to make a name for themselves
33:15 -  in such haste that they burned their brick, they baked it in fire because they couldn't wait for the sun to dry
33:24 -  so impatient to make a ziggurat a Babylonian tower into the heavens to study the stars for occultic
33:33 -  reasons and to defy God and to supersede God and to be his God. To counteract all that and to show his
33:42 -  good intentions, God fingers one man and gives him a wife who is barren and gives him lavish promises and waits till he's
33:51 -  beyond any hope that they can be fulfilled out of his own humanity. And then by the faith of the man
34:00 -  according to what God has spoken begins the setting in motion the fulfillment. And we're going to talk about
34:09 -  what Abrahamic faith is. Oh, my glasses are getting steamed up. So God is promising
34:24 -  takes him outside to see the stars so shall your descendants be not just the scraggly one or two but
34:33 -  the great abundance. By the way I had to say however much I missed my sleep last night
34:42 -  and having to pick Peter up and get to bed about one and finally parked the car after we got his luggage out I just happened to look up and what a sky.
34:51 -  You should have seen the sky. Did anybody take a glance? Awesome. It was awesome. The constellations that
35:00 -  not just the brilliance of individual stars you know in a whitish haze and it's fixed, it doesn't move
35:09 -  and in fact we saw a falling star on the way from the airport and my juror dropped I said Lord thank you for the privilege of looking up
35:18 -  at the sky. I had forgotten the magnificence of it. So we have to be taken out of our tent and be told look up. In other words
35:27 -  how many times have I been depressed, weighted down feeling hopeless and futile and Lord what are we doing here and this is nothing and we're just knocking about
35:36 -  and nothing seems to succeed and we're dragging and we're lacking in this and that and we're all finances and look up.
35:45 -  What does it say in Genesis chapter one and God made the heaven and the earth and he made the stars also. Like a little
35:54 -  after point. Oh by the way I don't mean the heavens and the earth and all that in them is but he made the stars also.
36:03 -  That's why God will hold every man accountable for the failure to acknowledge him
36:12 -  for his reality is written in his creation. When he believed in the Lord
36:21 -  verse six what do we imply? Maybe he didn't quite believe until then.
36:30 -  When you believe, when all basis for believing is gone you really believe. And we're going to get into this
36:39 -  in a moment. He takes up the Hebrew word for faith and the
36:48 -  etymology, the origin of the word and its etymology means staggering. You just want to crawl into a hole
36:57 -  for what we have thought the word faith means. Yes. What is implied in the great word believe. It's not just a sent to a credo
37:06 -  it is ultimate trust and confidence in a person whose word is the
37:15 -  statement of its character. It requires a knowledge of God. And that knowledge does not come
37:24 -  cheaply and that's why maybe then he believed. It took all that what how does this chapter begin after these things?
37:33 -  It took these things first. To come to a place of authentic biblical Abrahamic faith. Then he believed.
37:42 -  When all basis for hope is gone and God reckoned it to him as righteousness. Did you ever dwell
37:51 -  on that? Is it like a reward for believing? And what's the connection between righteousness
38:00 -  and faith? And if it's reckoned or imputed it makes clear it's nothing that could ever have its origin
38:09 -  in man. It's the distinctive of what God himself is. In a certain sense God imputed himself to
38:18 -  Abraham. He gave him his life, the character, his righteousness on the basis of believing. He was able to entrust him
38:27 -  with the treasure of himself because he believed. I don't even want to keep
38:36 -  and think by even making an illusion to this faith and prosperity quote message that has been current in our generation in believing
38:45 -  for a catalyke, believing always this is another dimension of the right. The two things should not even be mentioned in the same prayer.
38:54 -  And he said to him remember all this is a vision, it's not an actual experience.
39:03 -  It could have been, but it was given in a vision, this conversation with God. It was born in vision.
39:12 -  The whole Abrahamic faith and righteousness, the whole genius of it comes not even in a dream or an experience
39:21 -  or a visitation, but a vision. I am the Lord who brought you out of all the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess it.
39:30 -  Okay you guys, your turn. Exegete God's statement. Draw out its meaning.
39:39 -  Of all the things that God could say what does he say to Abraham? I am the Lord.
39:51 -  I am that I am. When Moses said to the God of the burning bush who shall I tell the people is sending me?
40:00 -  I'm in exile for the murder of an Egyptian forty years before and they don't know me from beings. Tell them
40:09 -  I'm the God of their fathers. I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. I'm the God of Israel. Moreover, this shall be my name throughout all your generations.
40:18 -  I am that I am. I will be who I will be. God's eternal
40:27 -  designation of himself and that's why in John 8 when Jesus is being mocked and taunted by his
40:36 -  peers, who do you think you are? You think you're greater than the prophets? You think you're greater than our father Abraham?
40:45 -  You Johnny Comeythly, you 33 year old whatever he was? Well he said I'll tell you that before Abraham
40:54 -  was I am. That doesn't leave you much room. You either have got to fall on your face and cry out
41:06 -  my Lord and my God or you have to do what they did. They took up stones to kill him. You don't take the name of the Lord to yourself
41:15 -  except you are the Lord. Abraham was I am and he was glad and he saw my day.
41:27 -  So I am the Lord, God's first statement to Abraham who brought you out to bring you in.
41:36 -  I didn't just take you out of a place of idolatry but I took you out to bring you in.
41:45 -  We need to remember that. To give you this land to possess it. So this saves us from ethereal spirituality
42:00 -  lofty intangible promises that have only to do with eternity. This land
42:09 -  the specificity of God this piece of real estate not just to contemplate
42:18 -  to possess. That's the reason why I brought you out. Of course with the land
42:27 -  it's not just a place to grow a garden it includes the holy hill of Zion and out of it will come the law
42:36 -  that will bless all the families of the earth and you'll hear even men today say God is not interested in real estate.
42:46 -  Israel is no more significant to God than upstate New York, baloney. This land
42:55 -  is specific it's given it has everything to do with God's purposes
43:04 -  to be enacted in time, in history and in place and to his seed. I've called you out that you might possess this.
43:13 -  Now we come into the mystery. My neighbor said, Oh Lord God how may I know that I shall possess it?
43:22 -  And God does not dispute the question but he gives a mysterious answer.
43:31 -  Bring me a three year old heifer and a three year old female goat and a three year old ram, a turtle dog and a young pigeon
43:40 -  then he brought all these to him and cut them in two and laid each half opposite the other
43:49 -  but he did not cut the birds. Why didn't he cut the birds? They were too small to be cut.
43:58 -  Every item here has to do with the traditional sacrifices Maybe the only thing of question is three year old
44:08 -  and God is so specific in his requirement nor does Abraham in any way question him. Why this? Why that? How come? What do you mean?
44:17 -  That's what we would say. How come? He did it. Abraham had faith Why this? Why that? How come? What do you mean?
44:26 -  That's what we would say. How come? He did it. Abraham's faith is implicit
44:35 -  obedience to what God speaks without requiring explanation. Later the explanation might come.
44:44 -  When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples and Peter demurred Lord not my feet
44:53 -  Jesus if I wash not your feet you have no part in me later you will understand now you obey.
45:02 -  Have you had that in your experience? If you haven't had you will have. Don't walk in that moment.
45:11 -  However much it contradicts all your categories even what you think would be incompatible with God and when you have the spirituality to hear God
45:20 -  even when he calls you to the things that seem to be in the standing of him which is exactly what happens to Abraham
45:29 -  in being called to take Isaac and make of him a sacrifice even there Abraham rose early he cut the wood, stacked it
45:38 -  took his ass and his son and he went up no ifs and buts no explanations he heard the voice of the Lord
45:47 -  it shattered all of his categories and it meant the removal of the son of promise it seems to contradict all of God's careful plan and intention
45:56 -  yet he did not hesitate for a moment and I don't think he even discussed it with Sarah she would not have understood
46:05 -  she would have gone hysterical he just simply rose up early in the morning and he did it faith is obedience and it's prompt obedience
46:14 -  without delay without procrastination Abraham had learned this lesson in Haran and here now perfectly obedient
46:26 -  in what God requires faith is obedience so he cut them in two
46:38 -  can you picture this? he went right through the middle and laid them out like that
46:47 -  as if on this white line one side one half this side one half that side this comes to Abraham in a vision
46:56 -  don't forget nothing of this is actually being enacted he sees himself doing this in a vision the conversation is in a vision
47:05 -  this is not actual event but as Delich is going to tell us it's for that reason more significant can you picture that?
47:14 -  because it's a vision it's all the more spiritually significant than if it had taken place in fact
47:23 -  and I'm thinking that because of Jim's remark maybe physically and actually you can't cut it but in a vision you can
47:32 -  and it had to be done in the vision and if it's a vision is it less real? is it just a flighty imaginative
47:41 -  imaginary thing or is it all the more real for the precision of what is being done that could not have been enacted in a fact
47:50 -  that's why it has become a vision but why that? it's unprecedented it's not been this way here too for
47:59 -  but it was not done this way God could not have walked between the pieces and the glory of God came through the pieces
48:08 -  to validate and ratify and endorse this sacrifice as being the answer to Abram of how shall I inherit this land?
48:17 -  this is how you're going to inherit it through covenant we will make a covenant you and me
48:26 -  and we are represented in the two halves you in the one and I in the other and we will accomplish this forever
48:35 -  and it's on the basis of covenant that this is going to be performed covenant is exclusive
48:44 -  unique, unprecedented it may have some what's the word? adumbration
48:53 -  some understanding even by pagan peoples where they made agreements and contracts this has its origin in God
49:02 -  God is the covenant making covenant keeping God and he was seeing it at its very inception
49:11 -  that there's no fulfillment to the promise of Abraham except through it and there's no fulfillment for us except through it
49:20 -  we are the people of the new covenant not new in the sense of novelty speak substantially the same thing
49:30 -  it's new only in the way of fulfillment I will write my law in your heart and I will do it
49:39 -  and we even see the presentiment of that here because although covenant requires the willful agreement
49:48 -  of two parties this is choice of ultimate radical kind that's why the animals are cutting
49:57 -  there's no turning back there I'll try it on secret works this is once and for all
50:06 -  it's absolute, it's total, it's death death to any thought that I might have had for myself and coming into an agreement with you God
50:15 -  on the grounds that you require it an absolute cutting through the covenant
50:24 -  you don't make the covenant, you cut it it's the cutting of the covenant
50:33 -  it requires blood as I said to someone the other day over the table if circumcision does not bring forth blood
50:42 -  it's not valid even in present Jewish understanding it's the blood
50:51 -  the actual cutting that establishes the authenticity and when you lay two pieces down the middle
51:00 -  there's no chance you're going to come together again you're not going to pick up after that and try, try again so once and for all in utter totality
51:09 -  and if it was not that God would not honor it if he sees any hedging if there's something partial, something withheld
51:18 -  that is not total, not absolute, not wholly given over he has no part in that and that's why so many marriages fail
51:27 -  it's the third court only when the two courts are authentic in their bonding and in their joining because they have cut something together
51:36 -  and they symbolize that in the ring that goes all around circum means around
51:45 -  to circumvent the world, to stick around the world to circumvent the flesh is to cut it off and around and entirely, Jesus was cut off and out
51:54 -  of the land of the living by his crucifixion he was circumcised without hands and in doing that he established the new covenant
52:03 -  he was cut off and out and we who join him are cut off and out we who join him are cut off and out also
52:12 -  from the land of the living there is a question he's looking for the symbolic significance of these animals
52:21 -  he said how come that they were not seven but when you add them all up the heifer, the female God
52:30 -  the ram, the triple God young pigeon cut him in half and said and I want to see the significance of eight
52:39 -  seven I would have seen as completion don't you understand? Eight is the number of resurrection it's the number of new beginnings
52:48 -  that's why it's eight there's a life that comes out of this death and it's everlasting and eternal and abundant
52:57 -  it's on the basis of that life that we are to obtain the land to possess it
53:11 -  so he brought all these to him in verse ten and cut them in two and laid each half opposite to the other but he did not cut the birds, they were too small there
53:20 -  they were not to be cut and we can ask what each of these animals signifies a heifer, a goat, a ram, a turtle dove and a pigeon
53:29 -  they all are symbolic of something this is the way of Deliches way of interpreting this a great Hebrew Christian scholar
53:38 -  into the college of Hebrew and the birds of prey came in verse eleven down upon the carcasses
53:47 -  and Abram drove them away you can imagine who the birds of prey are and it's not that they're just wanting a meal
53:56 -  they want to abolish they want to exterminate they want to remove this thing
54:05 -  before it becomes established Paul they know and Jesus they know but who are you?
54:17 -  and wherever they see the apostolic, prophetic authenticity there they are to try to devour it just like the child, the male child
54:27 -  there's the dragon waiting to devour it and it says of Israel in its last days tribulation
54:36 -  that its enemies eat them up and devour it like bread a remarkable graphic picture
54:45 -  it's not just enough to slay something you've got to devour it to remove its very existence and Abram drove them away
54:55 -  it says one act after laying out these parts and then after that it falls into a deep sleep
55:04 -  so verse twelve now when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram
55:13 -  and behold terror and great darkness fell upon her and this is the statement in this chapter that has always intrigued me
55:22 -  remember we spoke about the clouds and that somehow the glory of God is shrouded in clouds and in darkness
55:31 -  and a great darkness has come over the land when Jesus was being crucified so that Jesus' crucifixion was the circumcision
55:40 -  made without hands that is the seal of the new covenant for all peoples
55:49 -  over the earth what we need to ask is what is the conjunction between the establishing of this
55:58 -  enormously symbolically significant act of cutting and of covenant that somehow can only be enacted
56:07 -  together with darkness dread and terror and I get a chill even as I say that
56:16 -  that this must therefore then be the nation of Israel's final experience in the darkness, dread and terror
56:25 -  of its last days tribulation comes its recognition of its covenant making God and its union with him at last
56:34 -  and there's no other way that's the way it was with Abram in the beginning that's the way it will be with the seed of Abram at the end
56:43 -  clouds are gathering now already for anyone to want Israel fulfillment in the possession of the land without this covenant
56:52 -  and without the conditions of this covenant is to be dreaming it's not to reckon on God's way
57:01 -  I'll tell you what I think some if not much of our problem is we have trivialized God we have not understood, intruded
57:10 -  the glory of God the ineffable that means unspeakable
57:19 -  if God is now going to manifest his glory symbolized through that smoking pot and torch that passes through these
57:28 -  parts that have been cut in two can that come without darkness could Moses come up into God's presence
57:37 -  and not first being in a cloud for six days and then being called up out of the thick cloud and it's not a little white billowy thing
57:46 -  it's a fearful pulsating fire and the darkness and smoke of God's glory and that Moses cannot directly
57:55 -  just come up and say here I am he had to pass through six days a day for each aspect of his humanity six being the number of men
58:04 -  God himself coming to solemnify and ratify a covenant with man in his glory and he's got to be shrouded in darkness
58:13 -  God is coming to Israel God is coming into the world he's coming in his clouds
58:22 -  and the reason that we stagger at this and don't understand the necessity for the darkness in which he must be encased is we don't understand the glory
58:31 -  this is God what does it say in Hebrews 13 about the tremble this is not God speaking from Sinai
58:40 -  God is consuming fire consuming fire, fear, dread this is God
58:49 -  and Abraham had to speak through that God is calling you to a use that involves his glory
58:58 -  and the darkness that precedes it now it's interesting to read what Derlich writes
59:07 -  and I don't know the time of that writing but it was either the late 19th century or early 20th century certainly long before
59:16 -  the Hitler time and he says passing through the pieces he ratified the covenant which he made with Abraham
59:25 -  Mary was enveloped in fire and smoke the product of the consuming fire both of which are symbols of the wrath of God
59:34 -  we didn't look at verse 17 and it came about when the sun had set that it was very dark
59:43 -  and behold there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between those pieces
59:52 -  it wasn't just mere dark it was very dark and then there appeared a smoking oven
01:00:01 -  and a flaming torch it sounds very much like the cloud by night and the fire by day but it symbolizes God's own presence and his glory
01:00:10 -  passing through the pieces and that's what makes the covenant the covenant after the conditions have been found acceptable
01:00:19 -  and passing through the pieces is the statement of his acceptance of the sacrifice in the same way that when they finished
01:00:28 -  the temple of Solomon and even in the very first establishment of the tabernacle and the priesthood after the sacrifice was made
01:00:37 -  something like Elijah laying out his sacrifice the fire of God fell upon it and ignited it is the statement of God's approval of the sacrifice
01:00:46 -  that it's not a show of something or crippled animal or something that you can afford
01:00:55 -  but the best, the perfect, the complete, the total is the total God and if there's any hedging, any holding back
01:01:04 -  not a full giving over unto him his fire does not fall so the fact that the light
01:01:13 -  the smoke and glory, the smoke and the fire passed through the sacrifice as a flaming torch and a smoking oven
01:01:22 -  is the statement of God's acceptance of Abraham's sacrifice and of his obedience
01:01:31 -  and this commentator says that not only ratifies the covenant but that the fire itself is a consuming fire and a symbol
01:01:40 -  of the wrath of God a judgment that at some time and I'm saying that
01:01:49 -  this is at the beginning with Abraham it will be at the end with the people of Abraham both the church and the nation of Israel
01:01:58 -  must come to its final covenant union with God through judgment, through fire through darkness, through smoke
01:02:07 -  compare this with the present understanding and desire of many so-called friends of Israel
01:02:16 -  that want to see the present state succeed and just be patient in the end they'll go through some problems
01:02:25 -  it'll be the messianic prophetic fulfillment without the smoke, without the fire, without the judgment
01:02:34 -  you know what that betrays? an inadequate knowledge of God that is done only on the question of success
01:02:43 -  and not the question of glory Israel's establishment is not the thing in itself it's a means to a much greater end
01:02:52 -  through the glory of God and that glory always has to be shrouded and to appear and become in clouds of darkness
01:03:01 -  that God's millennial glory of a restored earth and nations that acknowledge God
01:03:10 -  comes out of the fire of His final judgment called the town of tribulation it begins with Israel but then goes on
01:03:19 -  to affect all nations so here the final birthing of the age of God the millennial age comes out of great
01:03:28 -  judgment, fire, darkness not progressive improvement that men would like to see
01:03:37 -  over a course of time that does not require these devastating things what a contrast between what men would like and the way that God himself
01:03:46 -  brings ushest in the thing that pertains to His glory do you need a break?
01:03:55 -  we ask for continuing revelation of the rich truths, my God, that are in this chapter before us this morning
01:04:04 -  we bless you for what you have already given and look to you, my God, to bring us to such conclusion now as should please you, thanking you, my God, for this St. Delich
01:04:13 -  and Teal, these two men, scholars who wrestle through your work, my God, and give us the advantage of your labor, we receive it as a gift to the Church
01:04:22 -  thank you as for remaining on that note people, I want to give you a taste of what good exegesis is
01:04:31 -  the drawing out, the Greek word, drawing out of the meaning of scripture what it means to be a scholar in the world
01:04:40 -  what it means to be a theologian can you think of any more wonderful occupation than to study the things pertaining to God
01:04:49 -  theology I know Jim makes remarks about the cemetery that a seminary often is, but don't disparage
01:04:58 -  biblical learning and respect the great gifts to the Church that has given in such manner
01:05:07 -  Calvin, Luther, much can be said in criticism as well, but giants of the faith who wrestled with original language and text
01:05:16 -  and sought the meaning of God and have enriched the Church thereby, you'll see it now here as for example, the question we took up at the beginning
01:05:25 -  why was this given in a vision? why not an actual act in performance? and he writes, a vision wrought by God
01:05:34 -  was not a mere fancy or subjective play of the thoughts but a spiritual fact which was not only in all respects
01:05:43 -  as real as things discerned by the senses but which surpassed it in its lasting significance not only is the thought deep and precious
01:05:58 -  it is expressed felicitously this is felicitous language this is where the expression matches
01:06:07 -  the content spiritual thoughts with spiritual words and I'll read it again
01:06:16 -  and you don't come to this too quickly this is through struggle, this is through labor, this is through effort this is through rewriting and rewriting until you get the statement the way you want it
01:06:25 -  some of you know what we've gone through for a few of our newsletters when we had to come up with a statement on the Toronto blessing or even now on the time of Jacob's trouble
01:06:34 -  how many times was it reworked and re-worked and re-considered and altered and rewritten until we finally felt free to publish it because once it's in print
01:06:43 -  that's it, you live with that and so I'm sure that these men passed through such labors so he's discussing
01:06:52 -  why a vision is a vision mere fancy or subjective play of thoughts? it's a spiritual fact
01:07:01 -  which was not only in all respects as real which is not only concerned by the senses but which surpassed it
01:07:10 -  in its lasting significance that because it is given a vision it communicates something beyond and more
01:07:19 -  than what would have been understood if it had been an actual happening that vision allows for an accuracy of spiritual statements
01:07:28 -  like what we talked about which probably in reality could not have been performed that way but in the vision it was performed
01:07:37 -  in the vision a smoking pot and a burning torch passed through the pieces in actuality perhaps that would not have been the mode
01:07:46 -  God is wanting to say something of a spiritual kind that is more able to give through vision than he would have been through fact
01:07:55 -  that we are open to data that goes beyond the natural senses and is as real or more real
01:08:04 -  than what the senses would confer to us and that gives us a source of data and input that is not available to mere earthlings
01:08:13 -  who are limited to sensual and empirical things only things that can be seen and felt and touched
01:08:22 -  this is the privilege of the saints by the spirit these things are intended with a lasting significance
01:08:31 -  more so than action events that strike the eye the covenant which Jehovah made with Abram was not intended to give force to a mere agreement
01:08:40 -  respecting mutual rights and obligations this isn't your little contract a thing which could have been accomplished
01:08:49 -  by external sacrificial transaction but it was designed to establish the purely spiritual relation
01:08:58 -  of a living fellowship between God and Abram of the deep inward meaning of which nothing but a spiritual intuition
01:09:07 -  and experience could give to Abraham an effective and permanent hold I'll read that again
01:09:16 -  I'm showing you how to read how to extract, how to mark I can't understand that anyone could read
01:09:25 -  anything worth reading without marking it I have got to mark it, I've got to put it in brackets I've got to underline, I've got to use my yellow
01:09:34 -  marking pen to catch the key words I've got to use asterisks that gets the meaning out
01:09:43 -  the words, for those who didn't hear this I brought my visit to certain saints in Germany and I was so impressed with the quality of these saints
01:09:52 -  some of them, five or six of them and they all seem to have the same quality of spirituality there's a depth to them and a quality of life
01:10:01 -  I said, what is it that you guys have? oh, they said, well we were all brought up in the faith by the same teacher, oh I said, really?
01:10:10 -  who was she? Well it was a woman I said, what? And she laid the foundation of this impressive spirituality
01:10:19 -  what was her key? oh, they said, well, she's a woman who said that we should study every word
01:10:28 -  that proceeds from the mouth of God and we dwelt on every word we've grown up on
01:10:37 -  Gone with the Wind and the cheap novels to dwell on every word
01:10:46 -  so listen to this statement this was not some little cheapy agreement, a contract
01:10:55 -  there's a deepest spiritual significance here that required it to be revealed by vision because it was designed
01:11:04 -  design means there was an intent by God of a particular kind
01:11:13 -  that has to do with things that are lasting and enduring not just what Abraham himself is a person but all the subsequent seed of Abraham
01:11:22 -  we're born out of his loins we were, so to speak, in his loins when this vision came we were already resident
01:11:31 -  and now it has got to be brought to consciousness it has got to be made our own so it was designed
01:11:40 -  to establish the pure spiritual relation of a living fellowship
01:11:49 -  between God and Abraham a living fellowship not a technical one or a contractual one
01:11:58 -  or a business agreement God himself is being imparted in union, covenant is union
01:12:07 -  covenant is an agreement that brings into union man and woman, God and Abraham it's very life
01:12:16 -  it's the life that's gone out of Abraham symbolized by the dead animal that
01:12:25 -  opens the life of God given into covenant and union so the spiritual relationship
01:12:34 -  of a living fellowship between God and Abraham of the deep inward meaning of which nothing but a spiritual intuition and experience
01:12:43 -  could give to Abraham an effective and permanent hold that somehow the depth of what covenant means
01:12:52 -  was more registered on Abraham's consciousness the fact that it was received in vision than if he hadn't gone through the act of it
01:13:01 -  in fact is what this commentator is saying so in what way did Abraham make known
01:13:13 -  his faith in Jehovah that God could say to him that Abraham believed and God accounted that to him, reckoned him as righteousness
01:13:25 -  in what way did Abraham make known his faith how is that faith demonstrated and in what way did Jehovah account it to him as righteousness, what a question
01:13:34 -  the reply to both questions must not be sought in the New Testament but must be given or indicated in the context don't go running elsewhere, look into
01:13:43 -  the word that is being given right here there might be allusions to it in the New Testament as a factor is in Romans 4
01:13:52 -  but we want to dig the essential meaning out in the place where it is given in the beginning Genesis
01:14:01 -  what reply did Abraham make on receiving the promise and what did he do in consequence when God to confirm the promise
