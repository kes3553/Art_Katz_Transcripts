Covenant Keeping 3

00:00 -  Once you have invested yourself as being an oracle of judgment, and then have to, on the heels of that, be the oracle of restoration, is like a contradiction. How do you go from the one to the other?
00:14 -  And, you see, here we have to have a prophetic sense of things. You have to intuit this, and a corresponding text would be Ezekiel 37, where the prophet whose word of judgment has been fulfilled to bring Israel to the valley of dry bones,
00:32 -  that they are without hope, we are cut off, we are as dry bones, is now the same prophet who's got to prophesy to the nation to raise it from the dead, which is the death that has come by his own speaking.
00:45 -  You hear what I mean? And maybe that's why he has to be brought out by the hand of the Lord and down by the Spirit into the valley of dry bones.
00:56 -  What God was saying to him is, I'm going to require you now to contradict yourself. You said one thing, now I'm going to require you to say the other. You've got to say it with the same conviction and authority as you spoke the first, even
01:10 -  though now it's another message altogether. So it's not only the nation that's brought him to a place of death, the prophet himself. So more than any other, the prophet cannot be allowed to be fixed in his own categories,
01:24 -  however correct they are. The Lord must be Lord, even to the place where he seems to contradict himself. It's something like Paul saying, let God be true in every man alive.
01:37 -  However much you can't fathom these contradictions, God is God, and you are the vehicle and the mouthpiece for that God. And you need to come into an agreement with him, even when it contradicts your own categories,
01:49 -  just like Jonah. So what kind of a man is that? And if we're saying that it's not only a prophetic man we're talking about, but a prophetic
02:00 -  church, that the church of the last days is prophetic in its very constituency, it must have this kind of yieldedness to the Lord. And it's something like Moses turning aside to see the burning bush.
02:13 -  And what the rabbis say is that what God so honored is that when he saw him turn aside, then he called him by name out of the bush. Because once you turn aside, there's no turning back.
02:26 -  And you know, it's remarkable how much people have an investment in what they believe and what they understand, and do not want to contradict it, even by God, because it's their security. What would be an historical example of this, where a people has been called to contradict
02:47 -  their own understanding of their own expectation of things given them by God, and could not bring themselves to do it, and even slew him, who was the one who presented the view of God to their own detriment.
03:05 -  It's Israel with Jesus. He was not in the form of their anticipation. They had wandered from the scripture.
03:14 -  They were under the influence of rabbinical expectation. Here's God coming with fresh revelation, and so fresh that even the disciples did not understand it.
03:28 -  Even to his death, when they saw him on the cross. We thought it had been he who would have restored the glory to Israel, but as he spoke with them on the way, their hearts burned as he opened to them the scriptures of the things
03:41 -  that pertain to himself out of the prophets and the Psalms. Christology, the study and the understanding of the significance of the atonement through Christ, is a post-resurrection phenomenon.
03:57 -  The church itself did not understand it, was bewildered, but the unfolding came after his death and through the apostle Paul and so on, that the church began to formulate its own understanding.
04:10 -  Jesus himself was God's hermeneutical key. He was the principle of interpretation of the messianic prophecies by his own peculiar fulfillment of them, contrary to Israel's own expectation.
04:26 -  And when Israel was faced with a choice of cleaving to their mosaic view and expectation as against the revelation that had now come in this man. It was a historic and costly choice because their view was so dear to them and their
04:45 -  identity was so rooted in that view that they rejected the revelation and God himself who bore it. So don't think that believers are not susceptible.
04:56 -  Hardline fundamentalists, baptismal people resisting the baptism of the Holy Spirit, or Pentecostal groups resisting the phenomenon of the prophetic. They have no place for it in their view.
05:11 -  Or pre-tribulation rapturists resisting the view of the rapture that is post-tribulational. You know, we have an investment and a security in our views and the ironic thing is that so far as we understand it, the view has come from God.
05:26 -  It's as we think God is saying, so let God be God and every man alive. The prophet of all men has got to be available to be contradicted in his own categories. Or it's like Abraham, take thy son, thy only son whom thou lovest and make him a sacrifice
05:46 -  in the mount that I will show you. It contradicted everything that Abraham could conceivably have understood about God. Even to this day, Jewish commentators are offended that God would be thought to be asking
06:00 -  the life of a son because God does not perform human sacrifice. And as it prefigures, the sacrifice to come. But what's more important, our view or the God of our view?
06:15 -  And the last identification and union with God that makes us his instrument is this union where we're even willing to put aside what we know. When God called Moses up to the mount, before he could come into his presence on the seventh day,
06:31 -  remember the forty days of neither eating nor drinking, he was six days in the cloud of smoke which was not marshmallow, it was not cotton candy. It was a devastating smoke of the fire of his glory that completely obliterates every human orientation.
06:48 -  I always tell about the fire that we had down at the camp in the Judah house where we were sleeping that night and I had to go back into that burning house and get Inger's pocketbook on the counter of the kitchen which I said was no sweat, just a few feet in from the doorway, sure thing.
07:05 -  I went in on my hands and knees, the house was filled with smoke and I got into the door and I was absolutely, totally lost. Not only could I not find the kitchen counter, I couldn't find the door through which I had just entered.
07:20 -  It was a paralyzing, fearful moment of a complete absence of orientation in the thick smoke. Imagine six days, why six? Come on you scholars, why six?
07:34 -  Six is the number of man. We've got to be completely emptied even of the things that are correct. And given once upon a time by God to come into actual union and presence with him
07:48 -  where then we receive the tablets of the law after we have come unto him and been there. So any man who resists that is disqualified prophetically. Maybe another definition of what a false prophet is, is one who goes so far but no further.
08:06 -  You know, you can bring in this far but I'll never change that. Or like Peter saying, Lord I've never eaten anything unclean. And a vision had to come down of a veil or a screen with, take and eat.
08:22 -  But Lord I've never, I don't care what you've never. And even though you've never done it because of the law of Moses, I'm telling you now that what I have called clean, let no man call unclean, take and eat.
08:34 -  God has got to be God. And what a tragic price we have paid as a Jewish people for putting our opinions over the God who gave us our opinions.
08:45 -  So God forbid that the church should repeat that. If we will reject the revelation of God by his word, we'll have to obtain it in the experience of it in suffering.
08:58 -  And I'm sure that many will gasp in that wilderness a time of extremity. Oh my God, now I see, now I understand what he bore. That in the experience of our rejection and our persecution we can now understand his.
09:14 -  To what degree are we identified with Israel? Are we going to look from a superior place of poor souls that are going through their suffering? Or are we, in their afflictions, are we afflicted?
09:26 -  And maybe in our identification which is actual and not just theoretical, the willingness to bear their suffering and their reproach and death in their behalf as we harbor and take them in will be a demonstration for them again
09:40 -  also of something of the attributes of this character that will bless the nations. By the way, the unbelieving nations will see the crucifixion of Jesus played out in the history of his people.
09:52 -  So once again, the final drama is enacted for the benefit of all through the cost of suffering, but at the end he wipes every tear away and heals every hurt and there's eternal rejoicing. What does it say?
10:09 -  The redeemed of the Lord shall return, mourning and sighing shall pass away, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. What a painful final consummation and conclusion to the whole Haelsgeschicht,
10:24 -  to the whole redemption history, the cyber of God, finally consummated in the actual experience of the nation that survives, the remnant, aided and abetted through the Church, identified with it and bringing it through
10:39 -  that by our mercy they might receive mercy at a time when if they don't receive mercy they will perish. And that surviving remnant would be redeemed and returned to Zion to receive the Lord who is their King and the King of the Jews
10:55 -  and for him to go out for the whole nations and bring the beneficent blessing to all mankind. This is a synonymous drama. Okay.
11:06 -  So we want to examine something of the judgment that leads to the tribulation of the last days and that the understanding of judgment, as we have said, is through the prophetic recognition that it is relative to the sins of Israel.
11:26 -  It's not God being arbitrary. It's not God taking a malicious delight in seeing his people suffer. Their punishment and their judgment is in exact proportion to their sins,
11:39 -  the sins of their fathers as their own and even Jeremiah saying that your sins are worse than your father's. And the basic sin, and this introduces us now to an important aspect of the whole study, is the failure to keep covenant, the rejection of covenant failure.
12:00 -  And I'm raising this question. Is covenant obligation still a requirement of God for this people even when they disavow or do not acknowledge the covenant or their obligation to keep it?
12:16 -  Are they still under the requirements of the covenant even in their ignorance of it? And if so, and the covenant condition for failure is judgment by expulsion, is in fact the very grounds by which we can expect a last day's expulsion again out of Israel
12:35 -  for the same reasons that former judgments of expulsion have taken place, namely the failure to keep covenant. The fact that men do not acknowledge it or recognize it does not invalidate it nor its terms.
12:54 -  It's blessing for keeping and curse for failure. And the curse is to be expelled from the land. And I've never heard anyone articulate this,
13:07 -  that this might be the very ground for which we can rightly expect another expulsion of Israel out of the land and into the nations of the failure to keep covenant. The truth of the matter is there's very little covenant consciousness in modern jewelry at all today, even in Israel.
13:28 -  But remember when the covenant was made at Sinai? And they transacted with God and I think it was the Lord who said, not only do I transact this with you this day,
13:39 -  but those who will subsequently issue from you for all posterity, that you're standing now in alignment with me for all generations. We Jews are obligated now with a covenant commitment made by our fathers 4,000 years ago.
14:01 -  And that the God who is the same yesterday, today and forever and who does not change is not at all impressed with the passage of time. The truth of the covenant and to which we have covenanted and made oath is still valid today.
14:19 -  And if I'm barking up the wrong tree, I welcome correction. And I write here that this view is lost to contemporary Jews and even to ourselves, locked as we are into individualistic modalities and modalities.
14:36 -  Know what I'm saying here? Covenant is with a nation. It's with a people.
14:41 -  And we have become so individualistic in the civilization that we have been birthed that we have lost this consciousness of covenant relationship between a people and a God. And therefore, it's out of our consciousness as well as out of theirs.
14:58 -  Or we would have warned them long ago to obey and to keep the things to which their fathers committed themselves. And this opens up a whole spectrum of things, national or corporate covenant and commitment as against individual responsibility before God.
15:25 -  There's a phrase that the theologians use called Solidarity in Sin, by which past and future generations are joined in collective accountability. This is a concept totally lost to modern men, but it's not a concept lost to God.
15:43 -  And as we said yesterday, when men will be judged, it's not by virtue of their view, but God's view. And part of our prophetic task is to bring modern men into alignment with God. This is God is the giver and the keeper of covenant.
16:00 -  Covenant is a heavenly concept. It came down to men from above. And God is very serious about it.
16:08 -  He's a covenant-keeping God. He gave us a new covenant. But everything is covenantal.
16:16 -  And it brings in the whole dimension of things corporate, which is lost to us in our individualistically minded age. And in that way only can we understand how God can judge an entire nation. And even a present generation of that nation, even for the sins of their forefathers,
16:38 -  because there is a solidarity in sin. There's an unbroken continuum of sin until a present generation acknowledges the sins of their fathers as their own and that the judgments which have been required have been just.
16:56 -  Leviticus 26. That acknowledgement has never historically come. I mentioned yesterday attending a lecture in Phoenix by a rabbi on the prophetic, the prophets of Israel.
17:11 -  And he showed the indictment against Israel coming from God's own prophets. And I raised the question, when in our national history have we ever acknowledged that indictment to be true, let alone requited it?
17:28 -  And the question answers itself, we have never. We do not see ourselves as connected, as having any obligation, but this is the way that God sees. And near indifference to the question, the silence about it makes us culpable in the guilt of it.
17:46 -  The only thing that breaks that connection is repentant acknowledgement of the sin which has not come. Therefore, present Israel is subject to any moment's retribution and judgment which still hangs over their heads, seeing that there's been no national repentance or acknowledgement, or a review of and a return to covenant with any thought to keep it.
18:15 -  That the new covenant is not some innovation, but exactly the fulfillment of the covenant that has always been before Israel. But now with the acknowledgement that Israel itself cannot perform it. It has taken all this time, all these millennia to show the utter bankruptcy of the nation.
18:35 -  Not because they're Jews, but because they're men. Because man cannot in himself perform the righteous requirements of God. And so in the new covenant, I will write my law and it will pass.
18:47 -  And they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them. And obey my ordinances and my commandments. I'll give them the very enablement.
18:56 -  That's what makes it new. Because look what your history has demonstrated. Not only a failure to keep it, but an indifference even to acknowledge it.
19:05 -  And that's why this will be an everlasting covenant. There need not be any one after that because it will never be broken. It shall be perpetually kept in the power of God who gives it.
19:18 -  For a people can be pleaded in power humanly speaking. That's the whole underlying of this drama that I say. We Jews are so self-sufficient, so confident in our own ability.
19:33 -  Even to perform things religiously. Until there's got to be the most thorough emptying out. Until when the power of the people shall be broken.
19:42 -  Then God comes in to be their savior. They're delivered to bring them back out of bondage, out of captivity. They were stolen to the land to rebuild the cities that have been laid waste.
19:50 -  To make deserts, to set up his sanctuary, his temple. And I will be your God and you will be my people. And in the power of my life being resurrected.
19:59 -  You'll be able to fulfill what was your call from the beginning. A nation of priests and a light under the road. All these millennia to perform this.
20:09 -  To demonstrate to all mankind the attributes and character and blessing for all the nations of the earth. That what God has done to Israel, he'll do for any people. Because he's full of grace and mercy.
20:24 -  It's a very great drama. I don't have a word for it. I'm quoting now from a German theologian. I tell you that the Germans have the corner on theology.
20:33 -  I quote God Weston about this principle of collective accountability. That is absent from our modern consciousness. And he writes in the theology of the Old Testament.
20:45 -  The prophets bring not only their own contemporaries before God's judgment. And denounce them for their rebellion. But also see them linked with all previous generations.
20:56 -  In a unitary entity. By which the sins of the fathers are also the sins of those now alive. And will be requited.
21:08 -  Maybe we ought to turn to Leviticus 24. This is Walter Eichroth. E-I-C-H-R-O-D-T.
21:17 -  In a classic study called The Theology of the Old Testament. Volume 2, page 407. It's kind of a little bit of an irony that German theologians
21:28 -  have a better grip of the mystery of God to Israel than Israel itself. And had Israel heeded the German theologians and the knowledge about God that would have come from them
21:42 -  they might have been saved what came to them from Germans who were not theologians but Nazis. Look at Leviticus 26.
21:53 -  Remember what the famous holocaust writer Elie Wiesel said to me when I said to what degree are you willing to consider
22:07 -  that the calamities of Israel even in the holocaust and all of our historic suffering has been the fulfillment of prophecies spoken by God
22:17 -  in the concluding chapters of Leviticus New Germanism and his answer I refuse to consider that. Let's take a look at what he was refusing to consider.
22:28 -  These are the curses of the covenant. In chapter 26, verse 17 I will set my face against you
22:38 -  you shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you you shall free when none pursue you
22:46 -  and if you will not yet for all this hearken unto me then I will punish you seven times more for your sins and I will break the pride of your power
22:53 -  that's exactly what Israel is in process of presently experiencing and I will make your heaven as iron
23:01 -  and your earth as grass you'll have no answer from above and no help from below
23:08 -  Verse 22 I will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children
23:12 -  and destroy your cattle and make you few number and your highways shall be desolate
23:16 -  I think that could be literal when the cities are ruined wild beasts make the veil but it's also a picture of the wild beasts
23:25 -  of Nazism and the wild beasts of neo-Nazism that are already gathering momentum
23:31 -  and will again ventilate their hatred against Israel Verse 24
23:37 -  I will also will contravent you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
23:43 -  to whom much is given much is required little wonder that so many of us Jews have said
23:49 -  who wants to be chosen look at the consequence when you fail to fulfill that
23:56 -  and I will bring a sword upon you and shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant isn't that an interesting phrase
24:02 -  the controversy that God had to this people the quarrel of my covenant poetic and
24:08 -  language to suggest the failure of keeping it when you are gathered together within your cities
24:14 -  I will send the pestilence among you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy
24:20 -  Verse 28 I will walk contrary unto you also in fury and I even I will chastise you
24:25 -  seven times for your sins isn't it interesting that in all of the recent calamities of Israel
24:34 -  not one Jewish spokesman and I have to say also very few if any Christian spokesman
24:40 -  have made clear to Israel that the suffering is relative to their sins so the testimony of God over this point
24:46 -  is prolific I can show it to you again and again and again that
24:52 -  for your sins am I doing this that this is in proportion to your sins everything is relative to the sins of Israel
24:58 -  but seven times more because of the brilliance of their call
25:04 -  I will make your cities waste in verse 31 bring your sanctuaries unto desolation
25:09 -  I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours I will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein
25:15 -  shall be astonished at it that has had a past fulfilment but it will also have
25:21 -  a future fulfilment and I will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you
25:27 -  and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste and you may have heard me say that
25:33 -  before the Lord gave me illumination when I would read about the cities waste I thought that meant the cities of antiquity
25:39 -  but I know now with absolute conviction it means Haifa, Tel Aviv Jerusalem, Tiberias
25:46 -  and every present modern day city of Israel will be made desolate and waste they are fated to experience again
25:52 -  the fulfilment of these judgments so long as the cycle of sin and iniquity is not over
25:58 -  until there is a repentance and a breaking and a turning the consequence will fall again
26:04 -  so the prophet is speaking about a past condition speaking about a future condition and some students
26:10 -  have missed considering the future because they see this only in terms of past fulfilments
26:16 -  everything that is described here is fulfilled in the Babylonian captivity and the destruction of Jerusalem
26:22 -  in 587 it was fulfilled again in 70 AD and it will be fulfilled again
26:28 -  I believe before this decade shall be over there is a repetition there is an unbroken continuum
26:36 -  and let's come now to the promise in verse 39 they that are left of you
26:42 -  isn't that a melancholy phrase they that are left of you and I can say assuredly
26:50 -  that those that survive God's last days judgement in the colonies of Israel
26:56 -  will be only a remnant a remnant shall be turned those that are left of you
27:02 -  shall find a way in their iniquity in your enemies lands and the city of their fathers
27:08 -  shall they find a way with them how is it that something that has had an origin
27:14 -  two or three millennia before still is part of the present experience of that generation
27:20 -  that's the unbroken continuum of sin and it's consequence
27:26 -  and we see this not only for Israel we see it for mankind we see it in our sons
27:32 -  that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children my sins and my failure is being visited upon them
27:38 -  and they're struggling with things that have nothing to do with their own failure
27:44 -  mankind and some people say well how can God judge the innocent
27:50 -  and what about the million and a half children in the holocaust that surely could not have been even capable of sin
27:56 -  that's what makes judgement judgement when the innocent are necessary victims
28:02 -  of the sins of their fathers and if we knew that we would do everything to walk in such a way before
28:08 -  God as to avoid sin and its consequence not only for ourselves but also for our children
28:14 -  if we'll not do it for ourselves will we do it for them if we understand it that's what judgement does
28:22 -  so here's God's requirement you can almost preface the word but at the beginning of
28:28 -  verse 40 but and God is still waiting for this but if they shall confess their
28:34 -  iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass
28:40 -  which they trespass against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me
28:46 -  and that I have also walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies
28:52 -  if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
28:58 -  I have to say it was just and righteous altogether can you say that after seeing
29:04 -  the Schindler's List that this was the theme of that film
29:10 -  to encourage the viewer to understand that the holocaust was the consequence of the sins of our fathers and our own sins
29:16 -  and that however painful a calamity it was in our experience it was altogether just and righteous
29:22 -  and in proportion to our sins then that film would have been worthwhile instead what does it do?
29:28 -  it portrays us as victims seeking the sympathy of others in such a way as that the calamity
29:36 -  will not again be repeated because it does not see it coming from the hand of God but from men
29:42 -  so the word of God is clear I will, I will, I will bring the sword against you I will
29:48 -  to attribute the judgments of God to being the work of men though he employs men, or to say that
29:54 -  it's an aberration in history that madman Hitler if only he did not live
30:00 -  if he didn't live God would have created ten like him over us in order to affect his judgments
30:06 -  one of the great perplexities of military historians is why Germany
30:12 -  in the last stages of the war the final extremity stripped of manpower, stripped of resources
30:18 -  nevertheless never let the oven cease they kept cremating Jews the day that the allied forces
30:24 -  walked into Auschwitz and into Dachau and all those places they were in a fever of extermination
30:30 -  even when it was contrary to their own self-interest when they should have been depleting
30:38 -  their forces for their own protection, defense they still invested monumental amounts of money
30:44 -  and material and manpower in the elimination of European Jewry
30:50 -  and the question was, well why did the allies bomb the train tracks bringing the victims to the ovens
30:56 -  and they never did it I don't know what reasons they gave they could not do it
31:02 -  because God's judgments are inexorable and to attribute them to men is to miss the point
31:08 -  of the God who works in history and if we will not see God in history working his judgment
31:14 -  can we believe for God in history to work his restoration so what do we do? We forfeit not only
31:22 -  an understanding of our past and misuse the past to enlist a kind of mortal
31:28 -  and sympathy for ourselves as victims that will guarantee that we will be victims again
31:34 -  but it robs us of any real hope for the future because the God whose word said we will be judged
31:40 -  is the God who says we will be restored comfort me, comfort me my people
31:46 -  and tell them they have suffered double for their sins but now I'm going to retent them how shall they believe that if they have not believed the first
31:52 -  see how everything hinges on the word of God and our failure to examine
31:58 -  the meaning of our calamity in the light of the word has been our tragic
32:04 -  condition because the rejection of the word is the rejection of God
32:10 -  God is the word and how have we suffered for the failure to consider it
32:16 -  we had all kinds of time and you can do this yourself Deuteronomy 32 is called the Song of Moses
32:22 -  but it's not a charismatic ditty it's a solemn warning
32:28 -  of last days terror that will come upon Israel for their apostasy
32:34 -  where it says that you will die in the chambers listen to that word
32:40 -  and that the, how does it say the suckling with the old men and then the young men and the women together
32:46 -  and when they open the doors of the gap of the ovens that's exactly the composition
32:52 -  of the layers on the bottom were the old men and the infants who had not the strength to climb up
32:58 -  to gasp the last air that remained and on the top were the most severe and the youngest
33:04 -  they died in the exact layers and proportions as the Song of Moses in Deuteronomy 32
33:10 -  describes and why was it given as a song? that it should be recited
33:16 -  for your children that you should learn this as a warning well I never learned it
33:22 -  I don't know one Jew in a hundred thousand that has ever read Deuteronomy 32 and can
33:28 -  even find it in the Bible we are a non biblical people and the rejection of the Bible
33:34 -  is the rejection of God and the rejection of God and Elvis Covenant is the reason for which we have
33:40 -  to suffer the devastating calamities the only thing that saves it eternally is
33:46 -  purely out of his grace his infinite grace without any deserving
33:52 -  in our part our history before him has been a scandal he says you have blasphemed my name
33:58 -  in all nations for I have driven you but his infinite grace and goodness will restore
34:04 -  a remnant at the end and bring them again the fulfillment of his calling
34:10 -  and give them a new name and make them his ministers and so with the knowledge of himself
34:16 -  and the fullness of his spirit that will make Pentecostalism and the charismatic movement
34:22 -  look like his stuff there we will have the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit on that remnant to fit them
34:28 -  for the millennial calling and they will be a glory and a diadem in his hand
34:34 -  the great mercies of God after the great judgment of God and that
34:40 -  not only will you know that I am the Lord really know but the heathen round about you
34:46 -  when they see this will know also so the whole prophetic task
34:56 -  is to restore this biblical mindset to secular
35:02 -  Bible rejecting mentalities what a task
35:08 -  I have not succeeded with my own mother what a task and it's not going to be a welcome task
35:16 -  you're coming out of the woodwork and you're crazy and how can you say that
35:22 -  and we're nice people and we've never hurt anybody and I've never murdered anyone it's remarkable how alien the concept of sin is to ourselves as a people
35:36 -  we celebrate ourselves we think we're hot stuff and look what we've done
35:42 -  in the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes and things that we've won but if Elie Wiesel himself is any
35:48 -  example who indeed is a Pulitzer Prize winner and a celebrated writer and humanist
35:54 -  whose own family has been obliterated in Auschwitz who says I refuse
36:00 -  to consider this what a statement of what sin in fact is
36:06 -  the elevation of the opinion of a man over and against the word of God
36:12 -  is the very anatomy and quintessence of sin itself
36:18 -  spoken and expressed by the best of jewelry not the worst
36:24 -  what then is the condition of the worst and if God who judged the nation for that condition before
36:34 -  will he not judge it for that condition now so I'm
36:40 -  saying what the prophetic task must be and is not
36:46 -  is it not the ground to which Israel's present understanding must be brought
36:52 -  how is it that Jewish calamity historically is never examined in this context
36:58 -  you'll never find it this way I made such an ass of myself at a conference on the Holocaust
37:04 -  at the University of Washington in Seattle and they almost had to kick me out scholars who
37:10 -  leading for their 22nd annual year on the study of the Holocaust and omitting God from
37:16 -  their consideration and just reviewing the statistical evidence how many lives
37:22 -  were lost by what poison cyanide was used and never raising the question where was God in all this
37:28 -  and here I am trying to to sound that note
37:34 -  and I was worthily taken by the scruff of my neck and how I've never been invited back
37:40 -  in fact one of the founder of the conference said well Dr. Cass
37:46 -  he gave me an honorary title you need to know he said that and he's a Christian
37:52 -  that we have to separate evangelism from scholarship baloney
38:00 -  I can't think of a place where this note needed more to be struck than men who occupy themselves with the subject of the Holocaust
38:06 -  but have never seen it in this life nor communicated it to people who need desperately to hear it
38:12 -  but else they suffer the same thing yet again it's remarkable what has been ushered in over the issue of the Holocaust
38:18 -  in present day theology and in the seminaries
38:24 -  the seminary that I attended the Ullfram seminary they had moved from
38:30 -  an evangelical position namely to bring witness to Israel and that we have as much to learn
38:36 -  from Judaism as Judaism has been in Christianity so this whole dialogical alternative
38:42 -  to an evangelistic thrust has so weakened the church in its witness as to corrode the very
38:48 -  foundations of its whole life that the man who was teaching this course who had formally been involved
38:54 -  in the evangelical witness was now the most caricatured, spunted piece of humanity
39:00 -  he was what did he call it his manhood
39:06 -  he was emasculated by deference to the Jewish community and because of the sense of guilt
39:12 -  that the church bears for the Holocaust subscribing to Jewish interpretation
39:18 -  of that calamity has nothing to do with the consequence of the synisimation but the failure of Christianity
39:24 -  seeing that it issued from a German Protestant nation and because
39:30 -  the church does not have an alternative interpretation of this prophetic kind
39:36 -  it has subscribed to the Jewish community and feeling guilty their argument is
39:42 -  how can we now present the gospel to Jews if the ground has been taken from us
39:48 -  how can we call them to that after what we have done now having settled that
39:54 -  is that to say that they are absolved from all responsibility that there is indeed a failure
40:00 -  and a tragic one and one for which the church itself will be judged but I can tell you much more about this
40:06 -  and I don't know if this is the time but the whole weakness of German Christianity
40:12 -  that made it virtually a caricature of the apostolic faith was not
40:18 -  in the least affected by the influence of Jewish intellectuals
40:24 -  in the 18th century who encouraged a movement away from biblical orthodoxy
40:30 -  and into a liberal view of the faith that emasculated the faith
40:36 -  and created the void into which the demonic phenomena of Nazism came so that what came
40:42 -  upon us in the Holocaust was the very Frankenstein that we in fact ourselves
40:48 -  hoped to create God sees this and yet we have a hatred against Germans
40:54 -  who are our creation we were so formative in German culture and civilization
41:00 -  and into the removal of the church of the faith as being a viable factor
41:06 -  in German life without exception every ideologue who contributed
41:12 -  to the formation of the Nazi ideology was the dissolution son of a Protestant ministry
41:18 -  looking for some alternative to antiseptic and predictable Lutheran Protestantism
41:24 -  and found it in an occultism that became the Nazi movement
41:30 -  the work of its ideological leaders of little wonder that God employed that nation
41:36 -  to bring his judgment if we could just see it how do you like to present
41:42 -  that message to the first community representing my corpse
41:48 -  home for my mother the driften who has been stolen for dinner
41:54 -  that is a message that needs to be brought and maybe our people who will be more partial to hear
42:00 -  in the midst of the exemption somehow when you've been uprooted and cast out
42:06 -  and really driven in your things that
42:12 -  constituted your respectable, polite and affluent life are no longer there
42:18 -  you're much more open to hear the things that pertain to the truth as God seeks it
42:24 -  what a remarkable revelation of God as God
42:30 -  to see him in the majesty of his judgments because he's righteous and the magnitude
42:36 -  of his mercy because he's holy we lose that revelation of God when we lose
42:42 -  this great saga of Israel and have a truncated and inadequate God
42:48 -  whom we call Jesus who's our buddy boy who helps us in the way and guesses what we need and
42:54 -  whom we offer a few kinship courses what a pathetic picture because of the loss of
43:00 -  God in this pool of life hmm, okay
43:08 -  covenant stipulations are binding it as an autonomous, lawless
43:14 -  generation chooses not to know covenant is requirement in law
43:20 -  keeping it and the spirit of our generation is lawlessness we are
43:26 -  antinomian even as believers let alone in the world and let alone as Jews and we don't want to hear
43:32 -  of regulation and requirement and all of that is a consequence of our inexistence in covenant
43:38 -  so the consequences of this as a curse might be deferred
43:44 -  in other words the judgment doesn't come right on the day that you fail it might be postponed but
43:50 -  it will inevitably come however long it's deferred and it's ironic as we mentioned
43:56 -  yesterday that when Israel goes out of its way to apprehend Nazi criminals
44:02 -  these guys are now 80, 90 years old I mean this is 50 years after the event they were not kids when it was
44:08 -  performed but if they're still alive and breathing my God will turn the world upside down and this side out to
44:14 -  apprehend them and bring them back and try them and execute them because as the advocate
44:20 -  for Israel said over the Eichmann trial that however long a judgment might be deferred
44:26 -  and postponed inevitably and truly it must one day come
44:32 -  and so Eichmann must perish even a generation after his deeds but the same logic is
44:38 -  true for the nation itself however long God defers the judgment and why does he defer
44:44 -  why is it not instantaneous because he is not willing that any should perish
44:50 -  the same very same reason why the judgment of God is not fallen on this country
44:56 -  and on the nations of the world in their filthy apostasy and conduct and blasphemous denial
45:02 -  of God is the mercy that withholds it and defers it not willing that any should perish
45:08 -  that if there's any hope for any last soul yet hearing a word that by which they can be saved and that they will definitely come
45:14 -  God withholds that the day will come when the last grace has expired
45:20 -  and the word of God is no longer heard and the prophets when he rises up early and sends
45:26 -  are rejected then the judgment comes and it comes at this moment
45:32 -  so we mustn't keep the seat to think that because judgment
45:38 -  is deferred that it's not going to come or that God has forgotten that we can go along sailing blindly and establish
45:44 -  our own nation and resuscitate our own language and become a high tech civilization
45:50 -  as if all that is the biblical past and who even knows that it's true
45:56 -  isn't it remarkable that the one nation that has the greatest likelihood of understanding
46:02 -  the biblical past because the bible is part of its curriculum is the nation that most rejects it as being credible
46:08 -  and the testimony of the the bible is our book as if we created it
46:14 -  and it's interesting stories in the prophets that has no application to the present the God of the bible is
46:20 -  not a living God one who need not be considered and sought even in the life of our worst predicaments
46:26 -  but they can talk to alifak but will not talk to God
46:32 -  and if that does not invite the judgment of God i don't know what will in fact God calls talk about
46:38 -  covenant he calls agreement with alifak and antichrist figures like that are covenant with
46:44 -  death and burial and that will be Israel's final chain that instead
46:50 -  of turning to a God who could have been its salvation will turn to men who
46:56 -  are even their enemies and who are dedicated to their eradication thinking that that could be their
47:02 -  safety what a pathetic commentary on what is the condition of the nation
47:08 -  at its best these are its best leaders
47:14 -  who are all humanists and whose confidence and faith is in man
47:20 -  even after the holocaust the terror and the magnitude of these earthly judgments
47:26 -  like a holocaust going up in quiet do not make the full sense
47:32 -  of God's intention except that they be seen in the light of eternity that's really a swing that
47:38 -  precious german oracle isn't here again from germany comes the greatest depth of insight
47:44 -  calls those judgments preliminary judgments to save mankind
47:50 -  from final and other and ultimate judgment so that we would recognize in the fires of the holocaust
47:56 -  a greater fire that cannot be quenched for which this fire will be intended
48:02 -  to bring us to place of repentance that we would search our collective soul and say for what sins have we suffered
48:08 -  this calamity then we would have been saved from the fire
48:14 -  that is eternal and from which there is no remedy except the repentance i put a message like that
48:20 -  some of you may have heard on tape in japan a minister a conference for ministers
48:26 -  and i said if you think that the atom bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki was just a political
48:32 -  and military experience you've got another thing coming this was not the conduct of men
48:38 -  this was the judgment of God for a God rejecting nation who has slain
48:44 -  the missionaries that have come to it and to this day does not have in the japanese language a word for sin
48:50 -  that shintoism like judaism is a contrived human religious system
48:56 -  that is more serving than God and that the atom bombing of the US cities engulfed in fire
49:02 -  was a preliminary judgment to save the nation from the fires to come
49:08 -  that would be un-extinguishable and a man shot out of his seat like he was launched from a cannon
49:14 -  God he said make me a prophet to my nation and that indeed
49:20 -  is the word that japan needs to hear and the nations of the world and this nation
49:26 -  in fact what is the collective statement that has come out of the holocaust
49:32 -  that's a repentant acknowledgement for sin of the fathers and our own
49:38 -  of a magnitude in keeping with the calamity but never again
49:44 -  a human resolution that we need not face such calamities again because they have come humanly rather than divinely
49:50 -  and that somehow we will have the strength another parable such condition need not come
49:56 -  when the people come out with a resolution like that it's an invitation to God
50:02 -  to get another judgment because they have not taken up the fight though they were burned down the bar
50:08 -  by the irons the ironies are so profound that there are many dispute
50:14 -  that cannot have been accidental there is a God of history and his judgments are ironic
50:20 -  and what he implores for anyone who has any decision that is so visible
50:26 -  whatsoever man shows, however long before that who shall he read even if it's millennia later
50:32 -  you feel still weak at it and how you read history and how you regard is how you understand causation
50:40 -  cause and effect cause and effect merely because something is delayed
50:46 -  does not mean it's unconnected and it's imperative for us to see the connections because in seeing the connections you see God
50:54 -  so where are the prophets now who would communicate this understanding
51:00 -  and not condescend to Israel's view of herself as being victim
51:06 -  and give her a false comfort as false prophets and make nice when they need it
51:12 -  the word of comfort where God says tell Israel their transgressions and take their sins
51:18 -  having lost all sense of this causal connection we do not see the linkage between Israel's present
51:24 -  apostasy and her historic suffering and this is expressed today in Judaism's efforts
51:30 -  to assure that future calamity will be avoided through education
51:36 -  I don't know how many appeals I get I belong to the Nei Brith I belong to the Anti-Defamation League
51:42 -  the Simon Wiesenthal Center the Jewish Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
51:48 -  now I'm getting many letters I'm getting phone calls wanting friends and I say what is it for?
51:54 -  for education the whole reason for which the multi-million dollar Holocaust Museum was established
52:00 -  in Washington, D.C. is to educate talk about a humanistic
52:06 -  premise that if mankind is educated evil will not take place
52:12 -  God is absolutely absent as a factor for their consideration and I said to the girl on the phone
52:18 -  I said would you be a thing? I said don't you understand that our worst sufferings have come from the most educated people
52:24 -  on the face of the earth? and if education did not succeed in the land of Girdershieler
52:30 -  Brixter, Hegel, Michi, Schopenhauer is it going to succeed with dum-dums? do you think money
52:36 -  is going to save you by programs? it turns you into God poor little thing
52:42 -  I'm trying to do service for Judaism and I have to say unhappily
52:48 -  that we Jews have been in the foremost lengths of being the ideologues and the
52:54 -  proclamers of that we are embedded humanists
53:00 -  our confidence is in men and in ourselves so not being able to see
53:06 -  the past interventions of God as his judgment nullifies hope and believing for the future
53:12 -  you've got to see this you will not see the judgments of God in the past
53:18 -  in fulfillment of his word you will not have any confidence or any hope in the future on the basis
53:24 -  of the promise of his word therefore, if Israel is to have any hope that will save it
53:30 -  in the trials that are ahead it will be only on the basis of God's word
53:36 -  believe in the fulfillment of the judgments that have taken place
53:42 -  the same God who has fulfilled the word of judgment will fulfill the word of restoration and return
53:48 -  and there is no other basis for their hope but the word of God
53:54 -  and what people have more right to believe the word of God which they have known in their experience
54:00 -  if only they will see it not as the aberration of a hint or the failure of
54:06 -  what's the nations to take them in what to bomb the railroad tracks that led to the extermination camps
54:12 -  but to see it as the fulfillment of God's word, I will I will bring the sword, I will bring the fire
54:18 -  I will so what to see God
54:24 -  in past intervention in judgment is to believe him for future intervention
54:30 -  in mercy that God intervenes at all in the affairs of men is ultimate offense
54:36 -  to the humanistic and liberal mind there is something about God intervening that is horrific
54:42 -  to unbelieving men they want man to do it
54:48 -  if the desert is to bloom as a rose it will be through an irrigation project or a dam that's built
54:54 -  it's not going to be through the miraculous power of God that's an offense if you haven't heard this experience of mine
55:00 -  very early in my believing life when I was in New York City being trained in Jewish mission work
55:06 -  the Jews for Jesus phenomenon was just beginning, we got a phone call from a high school, please send us
55:12 -  one of your spokesmen to visit one of our senior classes so they sent me
55:18 -  and their teacher was an orthodox Jew had a yarmulke on, Van Dyke beard beautiful, ethical
55:24 -  moral, prestigious man and I presented something about the faith and the Lord, and we got into a
55:30 -  a dialogue that became really huge and we were going out of hammered tongues before these students
55:36 -  and the bell rang, the class was over and we went out into the hallway and we continued and as I'm talking to him
55:42 -  all of a sudden I realize as orthodox as this man is as fastidious as he is
55:48 -  in all of these ceremonial observances he does not really believe in God
55:54 -  supernaturally and I said, excuse me, I said, just a moment do you believe that God
56:00 -  parted the Red Sea and allowed Israel to go over as on dry ground? as if I had taken a bucket of water
56:06 -  and sloshed him the guy went speechless and he choked and he spluttered and he said
56:12 -  well he said it was the confluence of parts he was orthodox in his
56:18 -  orthopraxy but he was not orthodox in his orthodoxy
56:24 -  can you see the difference? he said the confluence of parts he said well what about the birth of Isaac
56:30 -  who was a father who was 99 years old and a mother who had been life long buried
56:36 -  oh that gave me another naturalistic explanation and I saw
56:42 -  even in an orthodox man the inability or the unwoundness to believe in God as God
56:48 -  as the God who is supernatural as the God who can intervene in history as God, as God
56:54 -  and I've never forgotten that so that God
57:00 -  intervenes at all in the affairs of men is ultimate offense to the liberal mind. We want to do it
57:06 -  ourselves then even now in obtaining its own salvation through its
57:12 -  own efforts. I don't know when I wrote this but it was long before the concordance with Aleph
57:18 -  back in the PLO. So I would say my prophetic statement has come to pass that because men
57:24 -  despite God's interventions they will seek to obtain their own through their own efforts
57:30 -  and what that effort is and what real hope it offers is a mock and Israel will suffer
57:36 -  before the other. So as modern post-enlightenment Jews we are equally as adverse to the
57:44 -  concept of sin as we are believing for divine intervention. There's a conjunction between our inability to understand
57:50 -  sin and our inability to understand that God who can intervene and the events
57:56 -  of the last days are calculated because we have rejected the word to demonstrate the truth
58:02 -  out of our own experience of judgment and return. I praise God that all of this is on tape
58:10 -  because not just the intellectual weight of these concepts
58:16 -  but the moral weight. I don't know if I've ever been on the class my voice has broken so many
58:22 -  times as today so we just need to pray that
58:28 -  we will not be lost to sin. This is not my sentiment
58:34 -  being expressed but the grief of God. Our afflictions he's afflicted. He knows what's
58:40 -  coming. Jesus wept when he looked at Jerusalem. Oh how often I've taken you under my wings as I
58:46 -  sit. But you would not. You have missed the day of your visitation. They knew the tragedy that would come upon
58:52 -  Jerusalem. Not one stone would be left standing on another in the temple that they so much celebrated. They would be expelled from the nation.
58:58 -  They would be a ghetto of people. They would be a thorn in the side of the world in all nations where they would be dispersed.
59:04 -  There would be judgments and calamities in holocaust and again a final devastation. All set in motion
59:10 -  by that single grievous rejection of him before that sin.
59:16 -  So tragic is the consequence of sin. Are you saying you suffered all this because
59:22 -  you protected Jesus? No you suffered all this because the rejection of Jesus was the cast
59:28 -  stone and the final fulmination of a longstanding rejection of your prophets
59:34 -  and of your word and of yourself. He sent the prophets and you stoned them. He sent his son and you crucified
59:42 -  him. There was no alternative after that. That was the final filling up of a couple of iniquities in sin
59:48 -  and the judgments that had followed were all stoned from pain. So what are your tasks before us to
59:56 -  communicate to a yet unbelieving nation who have not even in this hour, sitting on a
01:00:02 -  powder case, ready to go off any real sense of the grief and the devastation
01:00:08 -  that is before them. It's humanly unthinkable. This can't come upon us.
01:00:14 -  That's what our Jewish court there said in Germany in the early 1930s and they're saying no.
01:00:20 -  So Lord, what shall we say President? We ask your
01:00:26 -  apology. We identify with the nation. Our own neck has been
01:00:32 -  stiff and our own ears have been closed by God. We are all God rejects
01:00:38 -  to the one degree or another and we thank you for a mercy
01:00:44 -  that does not obliterate us and we cleave to your promise
01:00:50 -  though you will destroy the nations that have destroyed us yet you will not destroy
01:00:56 -  us in full but you will allow a remedy for remedy.
01:01:02 -  Lord sink something deep into our consciousness
01:01:08 -  and into our spirits. The enormous calamity that comes
01:01:14 -  from unrepented sin that however long deferred
01:01:20 -  will in its time be given. And grant us my God that however much
01:01:26 -  previous generations of prophets have been rejected and scorned and derided and expelled in stone
01:01:32 -  that you will give us a power and an authority to bring my God
01:01:38 -  your perspective to a people even a remnant of them which if
01:01:44 -  they will receive it will save them from the calamity to come. Grant us that ability Lord we pray.
01:01:50 -  Thank you Jesus for this historic time. We are not ashamed to call it that.
01:01:56 -  This is more than a class. This is more than a school. Life and death hang in the balance
01:02:02 -  my God. And for this we have to say who is sufficient. We are frail beings
01:02:08 -  my God. Shocked with the fact. But for their sake and for your sake and your great name
01:02:14 -  save. So form us and so shape us and so use us my God that there might be
01:02:20 -  an eternal rejoicing despite the hollers that are yet to come. We bless you
01:02:26 -  and ask you to seal this for us and speak to us through the day and in the night and guide us and
01:02:32 -  establish your truth in our hearts and our character by your hand in Jesus name
01:02:38 -  Amen
