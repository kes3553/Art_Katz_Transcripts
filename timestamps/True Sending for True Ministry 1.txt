True Sending for True Ministry 1

00:00 -  and that which is not sent of God cannot accomplish the purposes of God and that which he sends he empowers so we're just going to examine the anatomy of sending the root of apostolicity by one of the first examples given in Scripture and
00:18 -  not even the New Testament but the Old namely the commissioning and the sending of Moses out of the burning bush so Lord we know that you're jealous over that word it's a word that designates yourself as the high priest
00:35 -  and the Apostle of our confession and we know that the church is built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets and we're asking my God for a renewal of the depths of the meaning of that word for we say with one heart and
00:52 -  one soul that we desire to attain to it my God not that we might all be called to it but we want to be part my God of what makes that up the configuration of things apostolic that makes the church the church so grant us my God insight
01:12 -  revelation and understanding and confront us by the text and meet us my God in the text in the depths of the vicarious possibilities my God that are for us in what is described there between Moses and you at the burning bush we bless you
01:32 -  Lord we thank you for the privilege and we look to you now for an unveiling by your spirit in Jesus name amen so let's look at the Exodus 3 now Moses kept the father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the
01:52 -  desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I
02:08 -  will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh
02:28 -  hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou stand is his holy ground moreover he said I'm the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob and Moses hid his face where he was
02:44 -  afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of
02:57 -  the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and Perizzites and the
03:12 -  Israelites and the Jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto
03:27 -  Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I
03:44 -  will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when there has brought forth the people out of Egypt you shall serve God upon this mountain Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel
03:58 -  and shall say unto them the God of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of
04:12 -  Israel I am that sent me unto you and God said moreover unto Moses this shall thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my
04:27 -  name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations amen well I haven't counted the number of times that the word sent is employed five five times well that's no coincidence either it would do us well just to underline the
04:44 -  word sent sent sent sent sent the root of apostolos sent one so what can we glean by this encounter with God and what principles have an eternal validity that are not just an Old Testament phenomenon but have an
05:09 -  abiding application that would give us an insight into him whom God sends why did this take place where it did on the backside of the desert and why was there a 40-year preparation in the wilderness that preceded it and why did God wait
05:32 -  for Moses to turn aside to see before he called him what if he had not turned the whole subsequent which is the German word that means salvation history English doesn't have a word for it would have been lost this one critical point
05:51 -  that this man turned aside to see when God saw that he turned aside to see he called him out of the midst of the burning bush Moses Moses there's something so critical this is the whole pivot everything that I'm asking comes
06:12 -  in finally to this vortex this pivotal one critical thing what he saw that Moses turned aside to see he called him we're going to explore that why is that the whole pivotal turning point that has to do with the commissioning of Moses
06:33 -  and if he had passed on by and had chosen not to turn aside to see what then would have been the subsequent history of the faith what would have been the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt and if there had been no
06:46 -  deliverance what would have been the likelihood of the messianic line that had its expression in Jesus to have come to the fulfillment of bringing him into the earth you can't I'm not saying enough I'm just
07:04 -  hinting at the enormous weight of what impinged on a single moment's obedience a single moment's freely rendered act that could not be compelled God didn't even tell him to turn aside to see something out of the man himself
07:24 -  something of what the man is maybe at the heart of what the man is was critical at that juncture and if God does not find that in us we we can forget any kind of apostolic commissioning sending or doing so we want
07:43 -  to invest ourselves in this and lay it there and try to understand what what is contained here altogether precious one of the questions I'm going to ask is what parallel do you see between the commissioning of Paul and the
08:06 -  commissioning of Moses two great Apostles if I can say that two great master builders two men who were key to the purposes of God to bring the people up and out of slavery and into a land flowing with milk and honey it's not
08:24 -  enough to deliver out it's it's also to bring in it's not just to arrest a people from the Egyptians but to confront the Pharaoh which is ultimate confrontation so this is this the Moses who had 40 years earlier sought out of
08:44 -  his own self-initiated conduct to bring good to his people and it eventuated in the death of one Egyptian hastily buried in the sand and Moses's requirement to flee that brought them into this wilderness and 40 years later
09:02 -  comes the moment of encounter and the true fulfillment of his calling you know what I would ask to what degree must failure proceed a true appropriation of one's calling and if that's true was it true for Paul and is it true for us and
09:29 -  are we willing for the humiliation of failure out of our best well-meaning intentions that God himself will allow and establish in order that out of the humiliation of the debris and death of that failure the mortification and the
09:46 -  humiliation can be formed the man that God can send that probably could not have been formed in any other way there's something about failure particularly when it's born out of the best well-meaning intentions to serve God
10:01 -  that does a depth of work in the human soul that nothing else can obtain you say well why haven't more of us failed because we have not what's the word tried we've not sought we've not had apostolic intention we've not had large
10:22 -  intentions for God and we've played it close to the vest we've been timid and nothing ventured nothing gained and to avoid the humiliation of failure we have not attempted bravely to succeed we've just kind of gotten by so I like
10:42 -  something about the largeness of soul that is to be seen both in Paul and Moses it's that largeness of soul in Paul that was not satisfied that this heresy called the way be allowed to exist but sought authorization from the
11:05 -  religious class of this time to seek out and to imprison and to persecute this heretical body can you see that if Paul or soul were more of a come see come saw well these guys will pass away I doubt if he would have been apostolic
11:31 -  timber t-i-m-b-r-e not t-i-m-b-e-r you know that word it was a qualification he was in error as as Moses was in error but the error was born out of an intensity of heart for God and when God will find such a one as that even in his
11:56 -  era there's more potential for an enemy of God with that kind of heart than those who purport to be his friends who have not that intensity and will just drift and get by and whose lives are completely lackluster and
12:10 -  undistinguished for God never threatened by failure because they never attempt largely to succeed so there's a remarkable correlation between Paul and Moses and I'm wondering if that's not true in and other men of an apostolic
12:29 -  kind Peter failed colossally dismally but out of that great failure came a great apostle maybe we're to take a look at that failure in chapter 2 in verse 11 it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto
12:47 -  his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hit him in the sand what
13:04 -  what can you learn from that that shows that though Moses himself was called of God and in Stephen's statement in Acts 7 talks about that he thought that he was called to be their deliverer that what is indicated here is a man not yet
13:21 -  qualified to be it however well-meaning what does that statement show that he yet lacks as good exegetes as those who draw the meaning out of what is spoken in these verses he looked this way and that and when he saw no man he did what
13:45 -  he did what's lacking there like the fear of God he lacked the awareness of God his whole posture was horizontal he saw he acted he looked this way and that way he saw no man but there's no consideration of looking up there's no
14:09 -  consideration of God and merely because you see something that needs to be rectified are you justified in doing it it's probably nothing more inimical that's that means opposed to the purposes of God than the well-meaning
14:27 -  intentions of men perpetrated in their own religious and human zeal this is so evident it was so evident with a soul that had to fail in his zeal to protect the interests of God that he found himself persecuting God it's evident with
14:44 -  Moses why is it not evident to the church I would say something like this something about the whole structure of church life and the necessity to perform something to justify its existence and its perpetuation compels it to act
15:06 -  without waiting there's no greater death than waiting and waiting is at the heart of priestliness I don't know if we'll speak about this in these days but we need to you have to come back for another two and a half week session but
15:23 -  after all of the things that constituted the ordination of priests and they are mind-rending and exacting and would drive a man up the wall in the fastidious attention to detail of washings and and and blood and and
15:40 -  anointings and garments and all of that whole procedure the last day the last requirement was waiting seven days at the door of the tent of meeting they did not commence their priestly activity until seven days of waiting were
16:00 -  fulfilled what does the number seven imply complete waiting complete for what for dying that's where we've got don't be numerical don't be American and and quantitative in your in your mindset seven is a symbolic and
16:24 -  number of completion and what was completed was the last dying of not man's evil or carnality but his well-meaning religious intention to do for God and until that dies is there any true priestly service and if it's not
16:46 -  priestly how is it apostolic Jesus is the high priest and the apostle of our confession the first proceeds the last in patience self-will religious ambition the necessity to do and to be seen doing to be recognized and to be acknowledged
17:10 -  is death to the purposes of God yes you may have slain an Egyptian but so what what has come of it but your own expulsion and flight so the partial answer to the question why haven't the churches recognize this principle there's
17:34 -  something about the makeup of them of the modern church the Western Church especially the American Church that is impatient to perform and to do I mean how else does it justify itself and if it's not doing and not performing and
17:47 -  not having a program how do you pacify the congregation why should they continue to come there's got to be some kind of an action some kind of a program what are you doing I think the most taunting mark that you can put to a
18:04 -  church or to its leaders of this what are you doing and I think it's the mark that we had to bear here in our earliest years when there was no doing but just simply knocking about and wrestling out the issues of faith and life and
18:20 -  community well what are you doing and how much support did we lose because we were not doing and not performing this is a great foundational priestly principle so let's just let this register Moses is a called one maybe we
18:41 -  ought to look at that and not just paraphrase it but look at the Holy Spirit statement of that in Act 7 in Stephen's summary of the history of Israel okay let's start from 20 in which time Moses was born and was exceeding
18:58 -  fair and nourished up in his father's house three months and when he was cast out Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words indeed
19:10 -  and in deeds and when he was full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel let's just let's not rush let's pause let's let this sink seep into our spirits full 40 years old it's not yet
19:32 -  80 years old maybe full humanly full of human sap and human vigor the very thing that needs to die if God is to be all in all and be the actual performer of the apostolic works to those who he sends in this 80th year when God
19:56 -  confronts Moses at the burning bush and sends him what does Moses say about that that we've already read who am I that you should send me he's a nebuchadnezzar he's a nebush you know that word a broken one a man who has no assurance of
20:24 -  his qualification he has been completely emptied out of all of his human qualification which was supreme and sublime both genealogically being a Hebrew of the Hebrews and of the priestly tribe and also a prince in
20:43 -  Egypt and versed in all of their wisdom and knowledge and yet 40 years after he was full the same man confronted by God and sent said who am I that you should send me how many people think that Moses is just being self deprecating you know
21:05 -  oh do you mean me oh really I had no no is this a man who is really emptied of himself has not a wit of confidence that he could perform anything let alone deliver an entire people out of bondage I want to say that everything that I
21:29 -  understand about God would make makes me to make this statement no man more qualified than him who believes in his deepest heart that he's without qualification maybe the whole preliminary work of God is to disqualify
21:48 -  us before we can be qualified did you put that in your notes isn't it a paradox and isn't it contrary getting back to the question why doesn't the church understand this to the whole religious the whole religious mindset
22:07 -  it's absolutely wasteful here's a man full of vigor at the age of 40 ready to do great things for God how many of us are chomping at the bit and ready to go to make our mark for God and God does not think it lavish wasteful or
22:26 -  extravagant to give him another 40 years of waiting in the wilderness till he's completely emptied out and then he calls him this is classic Saints I can't tell you how grateful I am for this sending of God of Moses out at burning bush it
22:48 -  is altogether timeless in all of the profound principles of God that have to do with sending that has to do with that which is apostolic okay back in act 7 when he was through 40 years old came to his heart to visit his brethren seeing
23:13 -  one of them suffer long he defended and avenged him that was repressed multi Egyptian here's the key verse verse 25 where he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand
23:23 -  would deliver them but they understood not doesn't that sound like a bit of the upstart of presumption presumption that a man who is assured of a cross and was he called yes he was called but it was not yet time to fulfill it so
23:45 -  here are a few things to take into our consideration mainly because you see something that deserves to be rectified or made made right is not a justification necessarily to perform it you cannot act in response to need now
24:05 -  if you don't have that in your notes you're fired from today that has got to him you cannot act in response to me that will be the last days deception of the church shouldn't we be doing something look at this need and look at
24:27 -  that me to how about that need and we'll be running off all over the place like chickens without a head mediating to needs in the text that we read to begin with Moses is not sent because he sees the need who saw the need God their cry
24:50 -  has ascended up to me I have seen the reflection therefore I send you you don't go on the basis that you have seen it you go on the basis that I have sent you what a difference and what a salvation from the ambiguity of running
25:12 -  here and there in the end him there in young so many good things that need to be done so many needful things shouldn't I be doing something those that are led by the spirit these are the sons of God and it's going to be a tremendous
25:28 -  temptation to see whether we are that kind of son what if the spirit does not fit you to intervene you see it it cries out to you you're well able to perform something but the spirit has not indicated or signified that you should
25:48 -  to what will you respond particularly when others are watching to see what your response will be after all you're a leader in the body of Christ and you know you're Godly and men are looking to you to do something and if you don't do
26:09 -  it what will be the reproach for your failure and how much of that is consciously or unconsciously a profound factor in motivating us to do I'll give you a supreme example of what a son of God is that when Jesus heard that his
26:30 -  friend what's his name Lazarus was sick he remained two days longer where he was sufficient for his friend to die while all of his disciples looked on hearing that Lazarus was sick and knowing that Bethany was only a stone's throw from
26:51 -  where Jesus's life was threatened and right away put two and two together and thought our master is a coward and is afraid to risk his neck even to deliver his friend because it would put him in a place of jeopardy and Jesus answered
27:09 -  them not a word so you know what this is beginning to show us the depth of character apostolic character that is wholly indifferent to how men perceive you and what they expect of you and that you can be obedient to God by not acting
27:33 -  even though it's going to bring a necessary reproach that cannot be explained and until you are that kind of man you're not yet God's men who can be sent the question is where do you become that on the back side of the
28:03 -  desert so while God waited for Moses an additional 40 years Israel continued to be afflicted an additional 40 years and God did not count that as being wasteful nor extravagant either he allowed an entire nation to suffer for yet another
28:21 -  generation waiting for the moment chosen of God for his own divine action this is not only a revelation of the man it's a revelation of the God who calls and sends the man and do we know that God in that way and until we do how then shall
28:41 -  we be sent for what will we how will we represent him and make him known if we do not know him as he is an apostle is one sent in the place of another he's representing God not his thought about him but how he in fact himself is that's
29:06 -  an expensive knowledge and so all of these things had to be waited upon for God and think of the massive suffering of what was involved during that whole time of waiting and God did not think it extravagant to allow it what would we
29:32 -  think because we are expedient and utilitarian and want to get it done now because our way is not his way nor our thoughts his thoughts we are operating more out of the temper of modern things than of the timeless and the eternal God
29:56 -  who has a far different view about suffering than we that God will not send someone who is half-baked in the understanding of himself because what is he going to convey what is an apostle what does an apostle bring when he comes
30:16 -  why why why is the apostle the foundation of the church because he's he's clever and knows the scriptures and those church government and how to set up or how to deal with issues of sin and however those things may be true what
30:34 -  would you say is the distinctive single and greatest character or characteristic trait of an apostle that makes him foundational to the church the foundation of the church without which there is no church that is church is the
30:52 -  knowledge of God as he is in fact in himself and not as we think him to be how many have such a knowledge and you can understand that that knowledge is not cheap does not come easily and takes a lifetime or years to obtain at the
31:16 -  hand of God through trial through suffering through failures that are permitted through humiliations and defeats don't you think that Moses himself reflected on the fact that it's 40 years later and Israel is still in
31:34 -  bondage suffering that much longer and where is the God that allows that and how is he just and where is his righteousness and why doesn't he alleviate the ills of his people and isn't he their covenant-keeping God
31:51 -  anyone who has not wrestled with these questions cannot know God if you have subscribed to some glib little well you know that's God and you know and not wrestled with the theodicy of God and the righteousness of God and the
32:09 -  judgments of God and why he allows suffering and how do we reconcile I'm not saying you would have come to an answer but something in your pishkas something in your gut that borrows in and wants to understand the enigma of God and is not
32:25 -  satisfied with mere simple creedal statements and God loves men like that who will wrestle with him it's not Jacob with me with the lure that the stream Jack Javak and many of us are not being sent because we've not wrestled because
32:48 -  we're satisfied with a patsy notion of God that may be technically correct but it's not true we do not know him as we ought and until we do if we were sent what would we perform why didn't they recognize his apparent call is it who
33:09 -  were you do you think that you're going to you know are you gonna make these things right they completely nullified any pretension that he might have had to being the deliverer how come they didn't recognize it well God give something in
33:23 -  advance and then bring the fulfillment later so our mistake is to think that because the calling that it requires an immediate fulfillment and in that I want to say that the spirit of the prophet is subject to the problem that
33:40 -  you may know something and be called for something or have a revelation of something but it's not yet the moment of God's time to express it and can you patiently hold it until that time is one of the tests that somehow God is pleased
34:00 -  to perform from the American and modern mentality would think that why not just give the calling when it's time to perform it why give it an advance and then call for it at a much later time why put the man through all kinds of
34:13 -  inward struggles and wrestlings and didn't got call me and how come I failed well why don't you just extradite it then and give the calling of the fulfillment right at the same time what serves by giving a calling well in
34:28 -  advance and then requiring it at a much later time but what served in a prophet holding something that he's not yet free to release though God has given it to them what happens to a man when he has to hold something for a length of time
34:46 -  and even without an indication of when that will be alleviated can you see something like a teabag seeping and how long live and how long do I hold this it's you know it's in my bones it's waiting for expression when when comes
35:06 -  the fulfillment what why does God allow that that's what I'm getting at what takes place existentially and inwardly that somehow serves the purposes of God and I don't think that patience is one of the more celebrated virtues of modern
35:22 -  life impatience is much more character how about the fact that Moses is 40 years on the other side of the desert is that just a coincidence why 40 what what's the significance of that number it's the time of trial and testing but
35:43 -  you we need to respect the extraordinary preparation of a man or service because if we don't respect it in Moses will we respect it in ourselves and we will we be willing to submit to waiting and to conditions of trial and preparation for
36:07 -  a true service when all the world in the religious world clamors for action I mean the doors are open the communist regime has collapsed people have been for 70 years in atheism wide open territory let's go and going we have
36:33 -  poor was with me with gene the guy who wrote the early church gene Edwards and that man was beside himself he had just come back from Romania and he was in fact he's now written a book and the thing that incensed him was that there
36:56 -  was a clear slate he was an atheistic nation that knew nothing about God and now the doors were opened and to his horror what was happening is that the American model of conventional church was being replicated in that land from
37:13 -  scratch they could have moved directly into apostolic verity instead they moved into conventional evangelical things with an elevated platform the minister passive congregation and all the kinds of things that have constituted death
37:28 -  spiritually in America now transported to that land because the people were wide open to receive anything that came to them so there's much to be said for waiting and everything to be said for sending let's look at that in free
37:46 -  chapter 3 Moses kept the flock of Jeffords father Lord the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even the world what do you think that the first angelic
38:03 -  pronouncement from heaven like this day is born unto you a Savior even Christ the Lord came to those who tended the flock am I asking a question to a bunch of moderns who have never had anything to do with sheep at all is there
38:28 -  something in God's heart that is tender to those who watch the flock by night who are dutiful faithful unprepossessing you know that shepherding sheep was the most disgraceful vocation in Egypt there was nothing lower in Egyptian value than
38:54 -  tending flocks and for 40 years that's what Moses did he tended the flock of Jeff of his father was that because there was nothing better to do or was that the best that he could have done but what is served in monotony in
39:16 -  regularity in something that is predictable that has no variation that lacks any kind of flamboyance or charismatic excitement that requires a steadfast patient faithful performance of something small and unprepossessing day
39:36 -  after day after day after day and if Moses had not done that would he have been qualified to bring the flock of God which is Israel out of Egypt was the one a necessary preliminary to the other and if so are we willing to serve our
39:55 -  apprenticeship in the things that are ordinary unseen unglorious undistinguished and show ourselves faithful in that in order to be faithful in the other so I don't think that this is just historical happenstance I think that this is the
40:19 -  sublime wisdom and requirement of God it comes out of circumstance it comes out of flight it comes out of Moses fleeing from Egypt and finding himself in Midian and into an economy that has at its heart the tending of sheep but it
40:36 -  was God's exquisite and perfect and necessary preparation for a man who was a prince in Egypt and I can't say that I have ever known this location but I'll never forget my one experience when I lived in Israel as an immigrant and
40:55 -  wanted to seek the Lord and in Carmel in in the mountains there in Galilee where they put up this experimental community I went up into the highest regions what watching the Sun come up to commune with God great fiery red orb of the Sun came
41:18 -  up meanwhile to get up there my flesh was so prick and cut and bleeding from the brambles and thorns and thickets that I didn't realize were there that that topography is cursed there's no more rugged severe topology than what is
41:38 -  Israel I mean it was rugged just to navigate my way up but I finally sat on a rock and I'm waiting to commune with God in that wonderful quiet the Sun is coming up and with it almost instantly the heat of a furnace and with it the
41:54 -  buzzing of flies for I found that I was sitting in a place that shepherds had occupied and it was laden with sheep dropping everywhere and so I had a little taste my romantic notion of communing with God dissipated I was
42:12 -  unable to be I was distracted by the buzzing of flies and flying I was wearing shorts I came home with lumps like that on my legs but it was because of what attends sheep how do you like 40 years of that so I have a great
42:29 -  admiration for men who are in undistinguished unsung places but who watch the flock by night faithful in the homely and inconspicuous service of God and somehow feel that there's a necessity for that before the things
42:50 -  that are glorious and that this is not something that we should pass over as just being incidental or coincidental but something in the prescribed wisdom of God for the man being prepared for sending how about the backside of the
43:08 -  desert he led the flock to the backside of the desert where the mount of God is to be found and only there so you can go to all your charismatic conferences and all of these renowned speakers for your great experience in God and come back
43:30 -  with ashes in your mouth because you've not gone to the backside you've gone to the front side and the mouth of God is not located there anybody know what horror means it means dry desiccated barren and impoverished that's the
43:52 -  mouth of God that's what God occupies that's where he's to be found and how many people have a stomach to seek him in that place or to be found there I don't know why he led the sheep to the backside because what does backside
44:13 -  imply I mean yeah come on you know speech for itself you know I want to describe some town of America as the anus of America the backside is unsavory you guys help me give me some adjectives unbecoming it barren nothing spectacular
44:42 -  the front side is where the action is it's the front side that's lush is the front side that has all the glitter and the big stars and the names and the activity and this is where the action is who's gonna seek the backside where
45:00 -  the mouth of God is it was then and it is now I can't tell you how much we approach and stink I had to bear to incoming to this place living in Plainfield New Jersey 20 miles away from two and a half million Jews and
45:21 -  coming to this nothing place out of a still small voice that seemed totally illogical to leave such a harvest field and to come to a place where we were the only Jews and nothing in this barren location what would be the equivalent
45:42 -  for yourself and do you have a stomach for it can you be weaned away from the front side with all of the four color brochures that come in your mailbox I've got bosses of Christian mailing I tell you it'll rim us in the winter with
46:05 -  invitations and appeals and the conference of the year and the man of God and the now word and the prophet and there's no end and the few of them that I've attended I've come away with the taste of ashes in my mouth highly
