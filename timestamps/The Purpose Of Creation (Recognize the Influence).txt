The Purpose Of Creation (Recognize the Influence)

00:00 -  The servant that the Lord sent to us in ArtCats. Would you welcome him? Good evening. Good evening. Hello. Everything okay? The sound is natural, normal, clear, reaching the back of the room. You can't hear in front of the room. You can't hear?
00:59 -  She can. She can? Yes. Okay. I'm always adjusting the windows. I'm an ex-school teacher, so I make sure that the room is ventilated, the lights are proper, the hearing is, the conditions are appropriate and conducive. Especially
01:17 -  tonight, because you don't dare miss a syllable of what I consider to be a subject so central to the understanding of the faith and so little understood, or even known, that it will require your full attention. So we have already prayed
01:40 -  that you will not be over fatigued by these messages every night and that the Lord would give you a fresh and enlarged capacity to receive this subject. And the launching point for it is the great statement in Ephesians chapter 3. In
02:03 -  probably one of the most difficult books to read, even Paul's authorship is disputed among scholars because it seems to have a note of eloquence and use of language that's not to be found elsewhere in Paul's epistles. I believe
02:20 -  he's the author and I believe that he was moved into such a realm of vision, understanding, and exposition that the fault of the church, historically and presently, is to read Ephesians through as if it's some kind of flowing rhetoric
02:42 -  to give us a kind of a lift, an emotional sense of things, but we don't really dwell on the content. The content is awesome and the intensity of that content, the concentration of what is expressed in a few words, is beyond any literature that
03:02 -  I have ever considered. So of all of the scriptures, I think the book of Ephesians is the most demanding and the most neglected. For example, if I were to say that in the verse to be read now, Paul is going to explain the purpose for all
03:22 -  creation, can you believe that? Can you believe that any man, however astute in God, can express in one verse what is the purpose of God's creation? Or did you think that it didn't require a purpose? Or that is just something that God chose
03:40 -  to do on an occasion to alleviate his boredom or to give him some object of interest for his own deity. One thing we know, we have a purposeful God and the remarkable thing that is called creation, the universe, the heavens and the earth
04:03 -  and all that in them is and the stars also, are the clear work of the living God who creates. But why create? Is it just novelty? Is it just look ma no hands, I'm able to do this so I will? That would be an uncommon, an unbecoming thought
04:27 -  about God. So it behooves us to have a little understanding of why God has created all things. And you're going to be surprised to learn that we are the central object and purpose of that creation according to this text. So Lord,
04:48 -  if ever I have asked grace for speaking and grace for hearing, I ask it now. If this text is dear to you and you are the very God who has inspired it and expressed it through Paul and intended for all the church, then I'm asking my
05:14 -  God a remarkable occurrence of your presence, the spirit of understanding, clarity Lord, the open heart, the projection of meaning into ourselves which need not be totally grasped by our minds but can go directly into our
05:35 -  spirits and later on you can call for it, later on you can let it rise up to the level of thought and consciousness but let not a syllable fall to the ground. Communicate something so foundational for the church for these people my God
05:51 -  who have callings in your creation, the nations, that it will serve them in good stead. Thank you for the privilege my God of speaking from this text and we ask your grace both for speaking and hearing, your presence with us, your mercy in
06:11 -  Jesus name, amen. Paul is very difficult to leap into. You want to start with chapter 3 and the principal verse is for verse 9 and 10 but it's almost a rude assault to leap in like that so you have to go to the beginning of the chapter
06:34 -  and then the beginning of the chapter draws you into what preceded it and in fact you realize that Paul just rolls it out by the art. There he's like God himself there's no beginning and no end but because of time I have to pass by
06:52 -  such juicy morsels as Paul explaining the mystery of the body and the gospel that has come to the Gentiles which I have mentioned in a previous time and get down to the centerpiece for tonight where Paul speaks of himself as
07:12 -  a minister in verse 7 according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who have and less than the least of all Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the
07:26 -  unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now in order that and
07:45 -  I'm gonna stop or else you'll be lulled in to a kind of tranquility that will miss the point entirely Paul is about to tell us what the intent is and the purpose for which reason God has created all things so how dare you sit there as
08:05 -  if you're hearing a mere sermon how is it you're not leaning forward in your seat with your hand cupped at your ear that you should not miss any syllable of this answer from the the Apostle who was given such grace to preach these riches
08:23 -  and to make this mystery known to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
08:41 -  Lord so the whole purpose of creation from this text is that there would be a platform for a phenomenon called the church and that that church would have something to fulfill for which reason God did not think it extravagant to
09:01 -  create all things and that purpose has nothing to do explicitly nor directly with the benefits that would come to men through the church or to the nations or to the church itself rather it's to make a demonstration of something called the
09:18 -  manifold wisdom of God to some dimension of reality that is above the world and invisible called us the principalities and powers of the air and that this is the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus as my Danish wife is one to say
09:39 -  how do you like them apples this is staggering it's contradictory it pulls the rug out from under our seat our feet and provides a purpose that we had never once ever considered and Paul says is the very reason for all creation what
10:01 -  kind of a church is it that could go on from generation to generation and never once consider and take the heart seriously God's purpose for all creation for which reason he has established the church how dare we promote our programs
10:18 -  and consider our activity independent of this central purpose for our being as church I want to say that the church that gives scant attention to this that chooses to ignore it or to that dismisses this as some kind of euphoric
10:37 -  play on words that is nice to hear but not to be taken seriously is ipso facto the church it's an institution it's a band of enthusiasts who are itching to promote their own ministries and perform the things that they think to please God
10:56 -  it's not a church that is concerned with that which pleases God according to his own definition and according to his own word that God thinks it important he doesn't explain why that a certain demonstration be made by the only agency
11:17 -  on earth that can conceivably make it and for which reason he's created the earth that it could sustain this phenomenon called the church and that purpose is for that church to demonstrate to this invisible realm of
11:32 -  principalities and powers whoever they are the manifold wisdom of God and that is the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus well I'm going to attempt by the grace that is given to expound what that means and to tell you if you've gotten
11:50 -  the book yesterday that a whole long chapter is devoted to this very subject from which I will likely be drawing tonight it sounds like an irrelevancy to be occupied with those things that are
12:12 -  eternal the eternal purpose of God won't that take care of itself when the time comes no the church that is the church takes eternity into its present and seeks the fulfillment now Paul uses the word now to the intent that now this
12:36 -  demonstration might be made though it has eternal ramifications because anyone with so much as a drop of apostolic sap in their blood knows that only if we are occupied with the eternal can we be of any significance in the now the church
12:57 -  that is only occupied with now that gives scant attention to those things that are eternal is strangely and ironically irrelevant but what kind of wisdom is God speaking about and who are these powers to whom the
13:13 -  demonstration should be made and why is it important to God the question for us is we're not required to have an explanation all we need to know that it is important that it's so important that he did not hesitate to create all things
13:29 -  in order to provide the fulfillment of this desire because the church that is not taking the desire of God to its heart however irrelevant that may seem to itself however devoid of practical consequences however it does not hint
13:46 -  that there's going to be blessing or significance for men or for ourselves and yet take that to itself as the first purpose for its being is the church that is the church indeed because that willingness to take God's purpose to
14:07 -  ourselves all the more when it has no promise of bringing us blessing but on the contrary it will mark us before those very principalities and powers as an object of their attention their opposition and their persecution if you
14:24 -  want to be left alone just ignore this text you want to go on with business as usual and promote your individual ministries just ignore this and then they will say Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you you're not even
14:38 -  worthy of our consideration that on that church that that requires our attention and that caused us a stark fear is a church that does not have to have a payoff and receive a benefit for taking to itself a purpose in God even
14:58 -  if that purpose threatens a consequence that will be painful all the more is that very willingness itself the demonstration of that wisdom because there are two wisdoms in collision and you need to understand that in this
15:20 -  context Paul is not talking about wisdom as cleverness or wise procedure or behavior on the basis of knowledge or experience maybe the better word for the kind of manifold wisdom that God is wanting made known is aware of value a
15:39 -  system of values a way of understanding there's a collision between value systems one originates from below and has the Prince of Darkness as its author and the whole world is enveloped and taken up with it and never once
15:58 -  questions its truth or legitimacy for example take care of number one if you don't who will seek your own self-interest the Declaration of Independence the self-evident truth of the pursuit of happiness as being the
16:16 -  commendable purpose for human existence avoid suffering and pain pursue pleasure seek and take care of yourself avoid loss sacrifice the wisdom of this world by which the whole world lives its life is predicated on that which comes from
16:38 -  below and in some and many cases gives an appearance I won't say of sanctity but of legitimacy it sounds rational it's reasonable it's addressed to the self-evident needs of men to put themselves first it's an appeal to
16:58 -  self-interest it's an appeal to self so what about a church that is willing to adopt something as central to its whole purpose for being that offers no promise of any reward to itself no advantage no blessing but on the contrary that this
17:22 -  will mark you before these powers because you are people of such a kind as to put the eternal purpose of God before every other purpose so you're willing even to suffer the opposition of the principalities and powers because you
17:39 -  want to see the eternal purpose of God fulfilled even though it offers no prospect of improvement or betterment or blessing but only trial opposition persecution that is the wisdom of God the very adoption of God's eternal
17:57 -  purpose as being primary and foremost is itself that wisdom because it contradicts all to which the world subscribes that is unquestioned approved and made the normative understanding by which men are to live
18:16 -  their lives which excludes eternity has no reference to that which lies beyond this life and its greatest lie is that this life is the purpose for our being and requires all of our attention our energy our consideration it's a lie it's
18:36 -  a deception it leads men into bondage and into death it prompts them by motives of lust ambition fame fortune it appeals to the to the carnal appetite to the lust it makes this life everything it omits God it makes you God
19:04 -  determining your own fortune pursuing your own course and no one will blow the whistle on you you'll have the approval and the sanction of virtually everyone so we need to understand that there are two wisdoms in collision and they're
19:32 -  both vying as to which wisdom shall prevail in creation itself the wisdom of God or the wisdom of the powers of darkness who seem to have all the models who emphasize prestige wealth fame reward
19:54 -  you so this is solely and exclusively something that satisfies the heart of God and only those who have a concern for the heart of God and the
20:24 -  satisfaction of that heart will make his purpose their own independent of any benefit that comes by doing that and that is the church in apostolic Lee speaking the church that we call the church today that has ignored this text
20:48 -  doesn't understand it doesn't desire to implement it sees itself as established to provide men with certain blessings by meeting their needs is a distortion and is not the purpose for which God has established the church church is not
21:05 -  something that panders to men it's not something institutional that has been established to require the interest of men by establishing programs and the church at large even in its best forms has regrettably come to that
21:18 -  pitiful condition only for the absence of the knowledge of the eternal purpose of God for the church and in fact until we identify with that purpose and look to the fulfilling of it we never will meet the needs of men if we put the
21:34 -  needs of men and the blessings of men as the foremost purpose for our being we ironically will never meet them but if we put the purpose of God as the first purpose God men's needs will be met by a church that is aligned with God and is
21:51 -  more disposed to give them significant answers for their life even the communication of the wisdom of God that is other than that of the world instead the church is itchy wanting to find something to do has to have a
22:08 -  program needs to justify its existence precisely because it does not see its existence in any other terms but in responding and meeting the things that are immediate and about them it has not seen what would have given its security
22:22 -  and foundation in God namely the taking up of the eternal purpose it would have freed it from the necessity and the ditch to do and to perform something that proceeds and is greater than doing and performing is being and what issues
22:38 -  from us should issue from our being and not be a substitute doing should not be a substitute for being the church that takes to heart God's purpose even though it has to deal with a realm that is invisible has to be something in order
22:57 -  to demonstrate that wisdom Paul does not say articulate that wisdom he doesn't say that the church is called to set it forth programmatically or make statements about it it's to demonstrate it and only a church can demonstrate it
23:16 -  because the wisdom of God is a way of being and it has to be made visible and demonstrable in the relationship and life of a people together that is called the church this is an ultimate requirement it's one thing to be able to
23:34 -  articulate statements about or wisdom but to demonstrate the wisdom of God is to bring heavenly values down to earth in a way that is so unaffected and so true in what we are about and how we relate together that even the powers of
23:56 -  the air are terrified at that demonstration they don't often have to see it I don't know how often they have had occasion to see it but I believe that these purposes must be fulfilled before the Lord comes so this needs to
24:18 -  find a place in our hearts and our understanding or we are crippled in our service for God as well as our knowledge of God we need to understand the cosmic context of the entire faith itself we need to understand that there's a drama
24:30 -  of a moral and cosmic kind that has had its inception from the beginning and is moving toward its conclusion and that this final thing is to be fulfilled by the church itself these are the mysteries of which Paul was a steward
24:45 -  the cosmic context of the church the thing that is before time and ends time the contest that God has with his rival seeking to bring into the earth systems of value that's that have every appearance of benefit and yet are false
25:07 -  and bring to men both bondage and death and that the only agency that God has created that can unmask this fraud blow the whistle on this deception is the church not just by identifying it verbally but by themselves presenting
25:27 -  the very alternative in their own life together it's a wisdom that I'm saying that requires to be demonstrated it's a wisdom that puts its emphasis on that which is foolish and weak as for example in Psalm 8 where God says that out of
25:45 -  the mouths of babes and sucklings he has perfected praise in order to stop the mouth of the adversary that God in dealing with these powers has got to defeat them not on their ground but on God's ground and God's ground is the
26:04 -  choosing of that which is foolish the choosing of that which is weak to confound what the world esteems as wise and as strong out of the mouths of babes and sucklings God has perfected praise has perfected wisdom to stop the mouth
26:21 -  of the adversary the adversary has got to be defeated on moral grounds I don't know how to explain what that means I'm trusting God that the spirit of God will impart to you a sense that what underlies the whole reality of which we
26:41 -  are part and we're only operating at the surface of it is a cosmic conflict and a struggle of a moral kind over the issues of life of truth of reality of meaning and of purpose and this has ever and always been so and that the church
27:04 -  itself not recognizing its call has been seduced and sucked into the wisdom of the world so that when we ourselves in order to promote the purposes of church will employ techniques and methodologies and promotions of the kind that the
27:21 -  world uses to advance its interests if our pastors become CEOs and executives and whiz kids of ability to to perform and to influence and move audiences or gather up funds or to speak in such a way to affect feeling as so as to obtain
27:43 -  a certain response and satisfaction we have lost all credibility we have lost all challenge to the powers of the air for we are playing our game in their terms manipulation is the name of the game they know how to manipulate they
28:04 -  know how to jerk they know how to pull the strings they know how to play upon mankind they know how to play upon fear ambition lust all the kinds of things to get men to be puppets and to influence nations and men and races in ways that
28:21 -  feed the gluttonous appetite of the powers of darkness that are the powers of chaos death and destruction and violence you can't understand racial you can't understand Rwanda you can't understand black people killing each
28:35 -  other in mindless bloodletting not white against black black against black you can't understand this Serbian thing about ethnic cleansing men without conscience the massive rape of women as a as a military expedient you can't
28:54 -  understand the rock culture you can't understand sport craze you can't understand commercialism and the whole consumer mentality of our world except that you understand that there is there's an influence pressing upon men
29:12 -  upon nations upon races that are called the principalities and the powers of the air don't think that there's some mirage don't think that they are effectual yes Jesus met them at the cross and made of them an open spoil and disarmed them but
29:27 -  they didn't destroy them so they are a disarmed and yet very effectual phenomenon who refused to believe that they are defeated and still have the grandiose vanity and egotism that in the end they're going to succeed over God for
29:43 -  that's the very nature of Satan and the very nature of these powers which are the fallen angels that have followed that fallen cherub and vie for power and want influence and have obtained it Paul says in 1st Corinthians if they if
30:03 -  they had known if the rulers of this age had known they would not have crucified the Prince of Glory well I thought it was performed by Romans under the influence of antagonistic Jews who were not themselves able to bring a
30:18 -  capital punishment but influenced the authority so as to see to the death of Jesus Paul says had the had the rulers of this age known what would be the consequence of his death they were too stupid to see it they only wanted to
30:35 -  remove this great threat to their false rule they would not have crucified the Son of Glory so they're capable of a crucifixion they're capable of taking over the whole nation of Germany and turning it from one of the most brilliant
30:52 -  liberal cultures in the world that produced great writing fiction poetry philosophy theology and making of them an instrument for the massive annihilation of the Jewish people and bringing the world that there's such conflict as to
31:07 -  threaten the whole of Western civilization in ten years if they can take possession of an entire nation of that kind and someone has wisely said that what they had instigated was defeated in World War two but the powers
31:23 -  yet remain over Germany seeking its next opportunity I'm one of the few souls that did not rejoice for the unification of East and West Germany because I said uh-uh dum-da-dum-dum Germany again a threat yet a third time in our
31:42 -  century their unification is not a happy note and if those powers that preside yet over Germany and have never yet once been identified by the German church let alone contended against by that church ventilate again their
32:00 -  characteristic wisdom and power on that nation we best brace ourselves for what is yet to come in our time through that people a church that does not recognize the reality of the principalities and the powers of the air is boxing at the
32:17 -  air is making motions that that have only a minimal prospect of consequence if then unless they have first understood met and contended and brought some dislocation of those powers over the very locality that they occupy what
32:39 -  would they say tonight about us and all of the worship and enthusiasm and and everything that we have expressed would that intimidate them would they would they count themselves threatened would they draw back and recoil or are they
33:00 -  yawning when one of the most flagrant boasts in our charismatic generation is taking cities through worship as if by turning up the amplifiers we're going to unseat those powers who have had had uncontended sway for generations and
33:22 -  decades since time immemorial it's going to take something more than that it's going to take a demonstration of that which is contrary to their own wisdom as it is expressed by a people who are living without fear without intimidation
33:37 -  who cannot be threatened who cannot be cajol who cannot be intimidated and who themselves do not manipulate we have to avoid with great fastidiousness any condescension to a method a technique an advantage that would come that is in
34:02 -  any way manipulative for in that we are echoing the wisdom of the powers that God calls us to defeat we have got to be willing for that which defeats them which is not our devices or our manipulations but our foolishness and
34:19 -  our weakness we've got to be willing to bear the humiliation of weakness to stand up before big crowds who think that you're some kind of pro and you can turn it on and off like a faucet and you know what you are you're just a collection of
34:35 -  of weakness and trembling in the ineptitude to speak a subject like this and yet to stand and trust that God is going to give grace to communicate that for which did our whole environment and history has not prepared us are you
34:55 -  standing for a reason brother I'm preaching your message okay pray for me while I'm speaking excuse me
35:29 -  you should be honored we've never had two in a night I'm astonished I didn't hear that not only am I honored I'm surprised that that's all we've had and we're not over
35:58 -  yet because I want to tell you dear Saints and this is no commendation of myself I didn't choose the subject tonight the Lord has chosen it but if I anything I know this if the powers of the air can nullify this night and make
36:13 -  it a non-event it will be a tremendous victory for darkness they have never been so threatened in the history of your fellowship in your movement as this night and I'm getting a Holy Ghost chill as I'm saying that that's why it's got
36:32 -  to come forth in the way it's coming forth and I'm amazed it's got to be this faltering and jerking thing because God's means must be relative to his ends he's not going to give you a smooth professional statement that would
36:56 -  contradict the content itself if the defeat of the powers has got to come in a way that is contrary to their wisdom then the very message about that must come in a way that is contrary to their wisdom it's got to come in a way that is
37:12 -  not professional that is awkward that is stumbling that doesn't know what the next line is and and that is out of a weakness of a man who knows the subject so well he could speak it in his sleep I don't know of another man I have not met
37:26 -  another man who knows it as well as I and yet I'm going from the text of the book as if I'm bundling through for a first time never having spoken it and I understand that that is an utter necessity for tonight because what I
37:45 -  tell you before that the prophets are required not only to proclaim but to demonstrate and you're going to be called to exactly this foolishness to exactly this weakness if the powers of the air are going to suffer eclipse and
38:02 -  defeat and be loosed from their orbits which they have enjoyed in an uncontended and uncontested way it will be because there's a pocket of foolishness below that is believing God and trusting God for the for the
38:17 -  consequence however the foolishness is that that speaker has got to taste and to experience it's not competence that we need it's a willingness to bear the humiliation of foolishness and weakness that's why there's hope for you that's
38:37 -  why we have been selected that's why we are elected not because of our distinction but because of our non distinction because we're babes because we don't have a credential that the world would recognize and the moment
38:52 -  that we begin become credential conscious and title conscious which is so inviting and to draw us into a levels of prestige and acknowledgement on basis of title we're already losing ground before those powers it's a rare man I hope this
39:11 -  is one who can enjoy the benefit of title without the loss of influence against the powers of the air who promote that whole credential and prestige system of titles which is which undergirds the whole world I don't have
39:30 -  to take the time to tell you of the struggle that I've had in such institutions having a master's degree in history and in theology but they didn't want to give me the one in theology and gave me every reason why they I could
39:45 -  not be granted it though I had fulfilled every requirement in fact my book on the Holocaust was that the the last thing that I was to present and then they found objections a week before graduation and gave me new assignments
40:00 -  that would be humanly impossible to fulfill and and the Lord gave me grace to fulfill it within that week I wasn't going to come up on a platform in the great Lutheran Cathedral of st. Paul for a blank piece of paper not that I want
40:14 -  credential but somehow what else is new you know who's who oversees and inspires the whole realm of technology well I'm so grateful for the day of graduation because I watched my
40:46 -  professors with whom I had been in collision here and there coming down the aisle in the ceremony of that graduation wearing their their gowns and their PhD identifications depending on the institution and and the subject in
41:05 -  which they received their PhD or their doctorate they had colored stripes it's a very impressive display and when they sat together in one section of the auditorium and my eye fell on them I sense such pride such arrogance such
41:23 -  stateliness of what the world applauds and for which men have labor to obtain and can sit there in and then I recognize in one fell swoop seeing that and the president on the platform and the lesbian professor that was called
41:39 -  from the East Coast to be the the one who would preach to us that day I saw a system I saw the design of the world I saw what it was that I was bucking against invisibly now made made vivid and real oh dear Saints the world is
41:59 -  system power prestige title wealth stature we need to hate it it's opposed to God it said enmity with God it's contrary to God and it needs to be defeated it needs to be identified by those who have such a sensitivity to
42:20 -  understand the evil that is in the world and to despise the systems of the world because anything that is system invariably is the work of man and to and watch that we don't ourselves slip into system out of the very necessities
42:38 -  of the things that we are about we've got to walk and so circumspect away that we need the operation of the Holy Spirit than the wisdom of God to avoid the pitfalls that are before us even religiously or Michelle I say
42:52 -  especially religiously for of all of the institutional realms that the powers of the air influence and occupy there is no greater influence and no greater expression of that power than in the realm of religion you buck against it
43:08 -  and you'll know how fierce that is and when its mask is off and its teeth are bared because you have dared touch it and challenge it you'll know how how real those powers are that have sway through those men who are not at all
43:24 -  aware that they're being influenced and operated upon the church needs to blow the whistle it needs to free the captives not just by the announcement that they are deceived and under systems of bondage for ambition and fame and
43:42 -  title that that will leave them without eternal hope that that when they come to the end of that line they can't take it with them and they've been defrauded of real truth of real value of real understanding of the things that
43:58 -  constitute reality they've been playing the wrong game but everybody else has played it and so they've gone along because there has never been an alternative presented to them and that alternative has got to be presented
44:14 -  only by the one agency that God has appointed the church that God has created all things in order that through the church the manifold wisdom of God all of its complexity and richness contrary in every point in particular to the
44:30 -  wisdom of the world needs to be demonstrated made manifest to the principalities and powers of the air that will call us to be the church because Paul doesn't say God is waiting for certain virtuosos within the church
44:48 -  to make the demonstration he's saying that God has created all things in order that through the church only the church the whole corporate knit of it the whole diversity of it of male and female and older and younger and fat and skinny and
45:02 -  black and white and every shape and size and description and all of its diversity and uniqueness and individuality only that church together and what it is in the genius of God as a real body tempered and moving by another
45:18 -  wisdom and hearing another drummer having another incentive another purpose can demonstrate to the victims that there's an alternative to their death to make that demonstration together as the church is for us to
45:35 -  cross because so long as we are under the influence of those powers so long as we are fearful and insecure so long as we require recognition and esteem so long as we are looking for titles and any of that of those things we are we
45:52 -  constitute no threat we ourselves need to be totally freed from those things that intimidate and threaten men and jerk and manipulate them for it's in that freedom and the exhibition the demonstration of that freedom that those
46:07 -  that are captive will can be known of their bondage so the church that chooses to be ignorant of the eternal purpose of God it does not give itself to that purpose as the first and foremost purpose for its being by that self-same
46:28 -  thing cannot be the church the church that is indifferent to the eternal purpose of God let it be however impressive in every other way is not the church in any apostolic and prophetic sense which is to say in any authentic
46:40 -  sense in order to be the church that is the church in truth we must embrace the eternal purpose of God even though we do not see any practical or utilitarian consequence for doing so because the whole world system is predicated on
46:55 -  utility so much given for so much received what do I have to do to graduate how many courses do I have to take how long do I have to serve I remember the first question that I got in every semester that I was a public
47:10 -  school teacher mr. Katz what must I do what what minimal amount is necessary in order to pass to get by we are a utilitarian world and you know how we express that spiritually we come before God with our petitions and then we stop
47:28 -  we've got off what we want him to consider and to answer and that's the end of our prayer time when it ends is where we should be beginning and continuing we don't even know what what prayer as communion means what Jesus
47:42 -  meant when he said this kind cometh not out but prayer and fasting he didn't he didn't mean prayer of petition that is not indifferent to our petitions but our petitions are only the beginning of the relationship that is expressed in prayer
47:57 -  if we are just utilitarian we're willing to give in so much in order to obtain that much that will characterize our prayer and so long as we're in that utilitarian mode we're not a threat to the powers of the air for that's exactly
48:10 -  how they govern and rule over men by in terms of utility what you get for so much invested what's in it for me what what's required for me in order for me to get this is the spirit of the world and a church that can break that power
48:28 -  that is not ruled by that that could be lavish as that woman was who came and broke the alabaster box and poured the ointment over the head of Jesus and the even the disciples had indignation at the waist don't know what God is yet
48:44 -  waiting for for the principle of waste is the principle of power it's extravagance that God is wanting and we're utilitarian we give him so much time attention of our substance we're playing the enemy's game it's beyond
49:04 -  utility that real relationship with God is obtained and by that same measure that we constitute by that reality that's obtained in that fellowship of union and devotion and opposition to the powers of the air they want to keep us
49:27 -  at the level of utility because the wisdom of the world is predicated upon self-interest and practicality that says what is the benefit for me if I do this what's in it for me but the wisdom of God which is contrary is altogether
49:42 -  sacrificial it does not rest on the benefit that one receives it rests on the benefit that God receives there's no benefit for us but rather the likelihood of embracing suffering in order that he receives his fulfillment
49:56 -  and this is so contrary in every point in particular to the ruling mentality of this world the wisdom of the world says take care of number one see to your own self-interest be concerned for your own security you have only got this one life
50:07 -  and that's why our divorces are as frequent and as numerous as those in the world it's a scandal that the church is as much given to the phenomenon of divorce as the world well I tried I gave it my best shot this guy's hopeless I
50:25 -  don't expect he's ever going to change and I'm hearing from everyone that I still have my good looks and while I have them and life is short I should drop this guy this character and try and try again whatever happened to Covenant
50:41 -  whatever happened to believing God whatever happened to the faith of a wife that God can an instant snap his finger and bring those changes that could not otherwise humanly be expected how can we be induced when to divorce
50:57 -  when we know God says I hate divorce and yet we lack the patience we don't want to continue we can't bear the struggle the tension we want something conducive how many ministers have shed wives who are not fomenting and aiding their
51:12 -  ministry I could name names and overnight go from divorce to another marriage and the and the body of Christ can't even blink and take notice that it has happened look my no hands it's it's a quickie and the new wife is so much
51:28 -  more conducive to the to the ministry of that man that you can almost say he did the right thing it aided and abetted his ministry to suffer a wife that would have been difficult and the trial and believe for ultimate resolution and
51:48 -  reconciliation from God that suffering in the relationship that God has given that no man should break would have been a testimony to the powers of the air and to the church itself but if we are ruled by a mentality that says well if we
52:05 -  suffered long enough that's enough and it's time now to change and I deserve it it's another wisdom it's it's the world's wisdom so the wisdom of God will require a suffering the wisdom of God is contrary to the wisdom of this world it
52:23 -  doesn't make our self-interest and our enjoyment and our betterment our first principle the first principle is what glorifies God what serves his purpose what is his will in this the man who thinks that his ministry is being aided
52:41 -  by a much more appropriate wife doesn't know that his ministry will never be of any consequence or significance in this age he'll be another charlatan another glib actor another performer yes populace all get out and raking in this
53:00 -  the funds but not affecting anything and the powers of the air can yarn right in his face because he has removed any kind of a ground by which you would have to be recognized he's just another performer another one for the religious
53:15 -  systems so there's a power of self-interest even in spiritual things that needs to be broken and the principal thing that God gives us to break the orbit of self-centeredness is the subject of the eternal purpose of
53:32 -  God this is not God as some egotist who needs to be recognized that his eternal purposes beyond any consideration of yours it's for your sake that is giving you a purpose for your being that alone has the power to break the inexorable
53:49 -  power of self-interest even spiritually speaking only taking God's eternal purpose to your heart can break the power that will yet express itself even in ministry even in religion even in spirituality this alone is God's
54:06 -  provision that's why it's first and that's why it's foremost so we are out of whack and warped until eternity has come into our hearts and into our consideration for his sake that this is of an interest to him this satisfies
54:24 -  his soul he thinks it's important that's all I need to know he wants to make that demonstration that's all they need to know it doesn't do a thing for me but if it does something for him that's all I need to know and once you've come to
54:40 -  that ground you're on holy ground you're on true ground you constitute a threat to those powers they know you you're marked that power can only be of self interest can only be broken by embracing a purpose greater than us and other than
54:55 -  us namely the eternal purpose of God and if you have not taken that purpose to your heart and made that first and foremost are you going to tell me that you're going to be able to extend yourself to Jews in the last days who
55:07 -  do not serve your personal interest and are not an advantage and a benefit for you in fact for you to relate to them and extend yourself to them in that time of Jacob's trouble is to put your head on the block and threaten and imperil
55:19 -  your life and you're going to do it not if you're taking care of number one first like that German man that older man that I met in Berlin who described how he looked down out of his apartment window and below the brown-shirted
55:35 -  Nazis with the swastikas on their arms in the early time of Hitler were breaking the Jewish shop windows and pulling the beards of old men and making them to scrub the sidewalk with little brushes and beating the children I said you saw
55:49 -  that yeah and what did you do well he said art what could I do I pulled the shade down and I turned away you'll pull the shade down if you're living for self-interest however thinly disguised you'll not be able to come to the place
56:03 -  of sacrifice for another for that sacrifice for another that brings no benefit to you but threat to your life and to your interest is the wisdom of God and that's the wisdom that was demonstrated at the cross when Jesus
56:17 -  gave himself for the other for ourselves for all mankind for Israel ultimate sacrifice because that the cross was the collision of two wisdoms two ways the powers of darkness emphasizing violence threat intimidation
56:36 -  having their victim in their hands and able to turn them in a spit and ventilate all of their malicious bitterness against him and even threaten him to say don't you know that if you say uncle and and throw in the
56:51 -  towel and give up your vein enterprise you need not be crucified for Pontius Paul said I have the power both to crucify you and release you oh do you well let me tell you that I'm thoroughly misunderstood and really there's no
57:06 -  valid charge against me and if you let me go you can be assured I'll do nothing in any way to threaten your system of government Jesus without blinking in complete calm knowing what crucifixion meant and the agony of the forsakenness
57:24 -  of the father when he became sin for all men said you could do nothing against me except it was given you from above that's the way we need to walk through this world without fear because fear is the enemy's way of manipulating making
57:43 -  cowards of believers and and having them to betray the Lord and aspects of the faith in one another but to be without fear to know that whatever comes there's a grace appropriate to that requirement and it will not come
58:00 -  except the sovereign God allows it and to walk through this world fearlessly is to do this to the powers of the air and to make them turn in flight imagine a whole church like that I'll tell you the Saints we're not going to come to it by
58:18 -  ourselves alone oh I know there are individuals here of the heroic kind who pop perhaps can it's going to take the whole strength of the church it's going to take being able to pray for one another and and give counsel to one
58:33 -  another and to identify for one another those things that we couldn't see for ourselves I came back from an overseas trip to the fellowship in New Jersey where I'd lived for some years to find that the three or four most significant
58:46 -  spiritual women in that congregation had all gone a-hooring had all forsaken their husbands had all run amok morally I couldn't believe it the most spiritual women and from our own fellowship the most spiritual woman left her husband
59:02 -  had a union with her employer had a baby by him and is now married to him and the one message she loved of all of my messages was daughter's of Sarah the message of submission and she completely freaked out and blew it all
59:31 -  so how did it happen that the most spiritual women in the congregation had become notorious whores I said to them didn't you know in advance what wasn't there any evidence any suspicious thing that you had noted about any of these
59:50 -  women before their final collapse and the catastrophe of the ruin of their marriages their families and the shame that has come to the congregation surely you must have seen some evidence a flirtation or absence from meetings or
01:00:05 -  something why didn't you see it weren't you together right weren't you rightly related weren't you speaking to one another in the fear of God didn't you know that sin is deceptive about itself and that next week is too late but that
01:00:25 -  today we have to speak to one another we're not going to make this we're not going to be this testimony we're not going to see those powers defeated except we received all the benefit that God intends for us as the church to
01:00:41 -  strengthen to receive counsel to keep us in the way everlasting to pray for one another to know to be able to confess our faults one to another and pray for that we might be healed yes to acknowledge that we're a congregation
01:00:55 -  of sinners being saved and there's it's an atmosphere and an environment where we don't have to hide and have our lonely struggles with skeletons in the closet that God will never allow us somehow to find solution unless we will
01:01:11 -  find it in the church in the body and with one another face to face we want a private solution we want a non what's the word threatening non embarrassing solution and God says no my church is to be in the light as I am in the light
01:01:34 -  it's Godliness is to be perfected by the sanctifying influence that each of the members are to each other and in that they are a testimony and a statement of my wisdom and can unseat the powers that have had sway over the locality
01:01:51 -  they occupy just by being what they are in God that what they are in God and the truth of that they have come and the reality that they exhibit and the true values by which they live is enough to unseat the powers that are over them they
01:02:07 -  themselves as they are in the truth of their spiritual reality is an answer to those powers the powers of the air are only obliged to recognize one thing authenticity
01:02:31 -  reality truth and they can see through the appearances and therefore you on but they know when they encounter the reality of God in men and women they know whom to fear they know whom to avoid they know whom to tremble and whom they
01:02:49 -  can safely disregard so when I was in the Philippines speaking to a congregation of ministers I said better that you would be known by the powers of the air and feared then you should be esteemed and known by by men and be
01:03:03 -  applauded oh yes they said that's right okay I said how many of you will stand and be and let God know you're willing to to lose esteem and recognition by men that you might be feared by the powers of the air for you cannot have both
01:03:20 -  you're going to be feared by the powers of the air you must necessarily discard and reject any desire for the esteem and the acknowledgement of men and I'm talking to third-world ministers who are out of poverty and to
01:03:36 -  become a minister of the gospel is to have some food on a table some income some dignity for your life and I'm saying get up and be willing to forsake that and be known by the powers of the air and feared and these men stood with
01:03:51 -  trembling they chose another wisdom and God will keep take them at their word and the powers of the air will know whom to regard this is a struggle we wrestle not against principle against flesh and blood but against
01:04:12 -  principalities and powers the rules of this world darkness but we wrestle and Paul is not just plucking some metaphor out of the hat he's speaking of the most arduous form of combat and opposition that wrestling represents it's more
01:04:30 -  than just the issue of strength it's more than just the issue of skill it's the issue of grit it's the issue of determination it's the issue of moral quality and moral character of who's going to win in a combat that is
01:04:45 -  eyeball to eyeball and fingertip to fingertip we wrestle but of course has got to be a we it's not an individual it's got to be a corporate body that can be engaged in wrestling and this kind of combat that will decide the issue for
01:05:02 -  mankind so if the church lacks this orientation this desire this purpose it will necessarily become in time another institution summoned by men to provide
01:05:27 -  human needs which have a life of their own a purpose their own reason for being that needs to be preserved and perpetuated and anyone who has encountered these institutions knows what I'm talking about they take on a
01:05:41 -  life of their own they may have had the most admirable origin of men on their faces in the sawdust crying out to God and from that day of beginning over a course of time out of the logic of the necessity to organize and to arrange
01:05:57 -  and to oversee and all of the other kinds of things that move the organic work of God by the Spirit into system they become an institution and the foremost purpose for its being is not the eternal purpose of God but its own
01:06:10 -  preservation and its own perpetuation and the powers of the ego oh have your rallies have your programs fill Charisma magazine with your big splurgy advertisements of the great thing that your conference is going to do and going
01:06:26 -  to mean it's blah it's sound and fury that signifies nothing it's empty it's vain it's loud it's noisy it's it's a pompous activity that will obtain nothing better the quiet ones who are unseen and travailing before God and are
01:06:43 -  living in a disciplined way and carefully avoiding any subscription to the world and its spirit who are fighting the fight of faith and are not allowing themselves to be intimidated nor intimidating others and what goes on
01:06:58 -  in bedrooms in the realm of private relationship between married couples and the way that a wife can coo and placate and get her way and the man condescends that's manipulation Saints if you if you will condescend to that
01:07:18 -  kind of tactic in order to gain your end for the moment you're you're in another wisdom it's not God's wisdom and the man can do the same and go out and buy hat or bribe or do it's play acting it's performing it's it's unreality and the
01:07:36 -  powers of the air love for you to continue in it and then come and have your orgiastic delight on a Sunday in a blowout of a worship time and then go back from that to living in a way that is more in keeping with their wisdom
01:07:50 -  than God for the rest of the week there's a war on powers of the air are brooding over Pensacola over the over Florida over cities over the entire nation and only one agency given by God by which they can be recognized and
01:08:09 -  combated the church but a church of what kind a church that is freed from its influence and has seen to it however painful that freedom is and maintains that because they are together with the people who know that there's a war on
01:08:29 -  and it's not going to be won by going to significant places of location and praying there as if by that activity you have turned the historic tide the same one who was performing that has is now stamping approval on other ministries
01:08:50 -  that are submitting to their great apostolic and prophetic program that is now worldwide and someone local in Minneapolis thinking himself a prophet whose mailing I got in the corner was approved by that that that ministries
01:09:06 -  he's come into the system he can use the name there's a prestige that goes with it he can be recognized he's one of the boys he's in the system and it's called apostolic my God I want to spit my guts out and I've told them time again listen
01:09:28 -  do what you want play any game you want leave the holy words of God alone don't dare employ prophetic and apostolic for your machinations and your self-seeking programs and and full-color advertisements and all of the groovy
01:09:43 -  things that you're doing with your international global prayer centers as if that's a hub that affects anything leave the great words alone because of those words are desecrated what foundation have we this is apostolic
01:10:00 -  this is given to us by the the great apostle the mystery that God has created all things in order that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated as it was demonstrated on the cross when utter malignity had
01:10:15 -  to meet utter magnanimity when utter viciousness met the charity and patience and forbearance of God the forgiveness of God there came the defeat of those powers by the willingness of Jesus to bear the total onslaught and the
01:10:28 -  remarkable character of God the wisdom of God is the character of God and when that is displayed by the church the powers are defeated Jesus and no one Paul know they know but they don't know them yet in us the system is cloying and
01:10:47 -  wants to bring us in be one of the boys go along receive the benefit and to be out of the system is to be a pilgrim in a sojourner and a stranger in the earth you're not one of the boys you're not good fun you don't subscribe you're
01:11:04 -  upon with suspicion as I am by those very things that I'm describing but I'm not at liberty to identify by name you're the square peg in the round hole you don't go along and I and I said to one of these brothers about their
01:11:23 -  prophetic conferences I said how come I'm never invited I was in this long before you you ever heard of in fact if you have any credibility at all it's from my tapes that have found its way into your books how is it I'm not
01:11:39 -  invited well already said you're just not one of the in-house prophets you're not one of the boys you can't be counted on to go along you're liable to sound the note that upsets the whole apple cart so we don't invite you you're not
01:11:54 -  in the system you don't need our approval and our prestige you don't hanker to have their comforting glow of men who surround you who have names that are world-renowned and count you as being one of the boys and a prophet whom
01:12:10 -  they will recognize I don't need that I don't want that I only want his recognition because I'm jealous to fulfill the eternal purpose of God that must come through the church and know that that system that wouldn't that now
01:12:37 -  is alienated from us and find this finds us not only outside of their influence but even constituting some kind of a threat is not too distant from the time when they will kill us and claim they are doing God a service count
01:12:54 -  on it so if I know anything about God his most significant work will be performed through men whom no one knows Paul said this about himself unknown but well-known unknown to men but well known to God the powers of the air also know
01:13:13 -  those who have authority and who have kept themselves from the spirit of the world they see those who wear cellular phones and their belts and are exhibiting pride and prestige I had to make mention of that in the Philippines at some
01:13:29 -  pastor striding the platform whose cellular phone was almost like a gun in the holster I thought is he going to have to make a call in the very midst of the service or does he enjoy the heft of something on his hip that signifies
01:13:46 -  to the poverty-stricken congregation that he's in a place of such esteem with God that he can afford this electronic device you see how we strange prophets looked at throwing their phones away how we see what those things represent you
01:14:07 -  know my message was that night I came without a message it was humility it was Jesus coming down on the back of an ass upon which never man sat though he said to his disciples go to that village and you'll find a donkey and it's and it's
01:14:23 -  cult bring them both and if anyone stops you tell them the Lord has need of them and so they found them and they brought them both and Jesus instead of sitting on the mature animal upon which men had sat to go down the precipitous Mount of
01:14:39 -  olives which is even humiliating to walk down you can't keep an erect structure chose that fall and that cult upon which never man sat and they shouted hallelujah for the kingdom that has come Hosanna for the king for your king shall
01:14:57 -  come to you lowly and meek or he'll not come to you at all and his kingdom shall come lowly and meek or it will not come at all for the lowliness and meekness of God is the wisdom of God and he'll not come in any other way than that which he
01:15:10 -  has come and will again come and must come even through his body which is the church anything that we pick up any device any strutting any arrogance any macho display is contrary to that wisdom a little thing can undo us
01:15:31 -  God has chosen the foolish and the weak thing and we need to live without the need to possess to have to see prestige and to be recognized the guileless and the childlike manifest the wisdom that defeats the powers the Christianity
01:15:48 -  that becomes prestigious dignified acceptable and respectable becomes apostate every true obedience is a reiteration of the cross every true preaching is a reiteration of the cross every true witness is a reiteration of
01:16:09 -  the cross that I can be in a Lutheran seminary for two years and attend the daily chapel services and I don't remember one message ever spoken that each one though was elaborately developed and fully biblical and
01:16:23 -  doctrinally sound I don't remember any of them there wasn't one professor who would dare take the chance of trusting God without coming equipped to his fingernails but he he saw to it that his reputation and name would remain
01:16:41 -  unscathed because he gave a perfect formulated message because he knew months in advance when his day would come where was the man who's willing to stand and trust God and come with an open Bible or the barest percent of it
01:16:55 -  that what the theme is and let the Lord unfold it and suffer the indignity and the humiliation of choking and waiting for the next word that is death and that is humiliation and that is the cross and that is the power of God those
01:17:11 -  messages sink in those messages penetrate those messages constitute event and the other just something that passes over us without consequence wherever the cross is reiterated wherever there's true prayer that cost
01:17:26 -  something wherever there's a witness where there's palpitation of heart and an embarrassed fear of being contradicted or facing a Jew and all of the arrogance of their worldly wisdom and ability and your willingness to do
01:17:41 -  that and trust God in that is the reiteration of the cross and wherever the cross is expressed the power of God is expressed and the powers of the air are set back by that demonstration
01:17:53 -  so maybe we'd be a people willing to bear again that cross if it doesn't cost us if there's no threat if there's no trembling we may well wonder if we have fallen into something less than other than what God is waiting
01:18:22 -  for and desiring because we're afraid we're afraid to fail we're afraid to lose the affection of the steam of men and we will then see to it that what we speak is so well covered and assured that there'll be no loss but the powers
01:18:40 -  of the air then remain totally untroubled wherever there's an obedience unto suffering where there's a trust in God rather than a trust in yourself wherever the power of the air sees the cross reiterated in that place and in
01:18:54 -  that moment they are defeated and set back is not only the cross proclaim but the cross demonstrated every time the cross is demonstrated namely the suffering of it the death of it in that moment the power of it is released and
01:19:05 -  the powers of the air are required to flee it is the demonstration of God himself what Jesus demonstrated at the cross was the wisdom of God it is the character of God it is God himself self-sacrifice the cross is the
01:19:24 -  demonstration of God in the willingness of the God man to yield up his life to suffer the misunderstanding the taunts and the jeers of his own people come down save yourself the very thing that he could not do was willing to bear the
01:19:40 -  insults the colony the pain the suffering that willingness is the wisdom of God it's another wisdom contrary to that self-saving preserving careful for one's name one's reputation one's life it's another wisdom it's what God is and
01:20:01 -  which and what the church itself needs to demonstrate in itself as a body and bring the final defeat to the powers in the same way that they experienced the initial defeat by that demonstration of that wisdom and that value that Jesus
01:20:18 -  expressed at the cross every time we defer immediate gratification it is an act on earth that verifies and substantiates that there's a God in heaven these all died not having received the promise but they were
01:20:32 -  faithful and again received a good report they didn't need their reward now it could be deferred they knew it would come at a later time those that were stripped of their earthly goods received it with joy knowing in themselves that
01:20:49 -  they had a greater recompense in heaven all of that kind of testimony is contrary to the wisdom of the world that wants its fix now wants its gratification now wants its reward now those people who can defer reward that
01:21:05 -  will is not even to be obtained in this life but in the life to come and yet serve as completely and courageously and devotedly as if the reward would come in this life are giving evidence by that ability that there's a God who is
01:21:20 -  invisible unseen but for whom they live and serve and have their being got the idea they're living by another wisdom it's real living it's without fear it's confident in God that though the reward will not come in this life it will come
01:21:36 -  and we have such an assurance of that expectation that we can live valiantly and bravely in this life and don't need to pay off now it's contrary to the wisdom of the world that says utility you extend yourself now get rewarded
01:21:54 -  well you'll have to read this entire chapter I want to pray for a church that will take to itself as its first purpose of being the eternal purpose of God though there's no benefit though by doing so you your mark before the powers of the
01:22:25 -  air and far from receiving reward you'll receive opposition but your very willingness to do so is itself the wisdom for which God waits and the wisdom that they hate and if you're good if you can do that now for God you can
01:22:40 -  do that for Jews later it's the same wisdom if you can extend yourself for Jews as a Gentile when there's nothing in it for you but the prospect of threat of imprisonment the loss of life you are demonstrating not only the mercy of God
01:22:58 -  that will be salvific for those Jews but the wisdom of God that defeats the powers that observe you and I want to say that unless you're progressively day by day growing in that wisdom and and avoiding the wisdom of the world and
01:23:13 -  any surrender to it in any form however subtle you'll not be able to demonstrate that wisdom and that mercy in that hour the issue of the Jew is the final testimony of the church as the church because both groups say to Jesus
01:23:28 -  Lord when did we see you naked thirsty hungry and in prison they both say Lord but one did not see and was not able or willing to extend mercy and the other did because God calls them the righteous are people who do not live for
01:23:51 -  themselves but for the purpose of God and if the purpose of God is going to be furthered by the return of a remnant of world Jewry as the redeemed of the Lord to Zion then it's worth dying for and the issue of the willingness to die the
01:24:10 -  issue of martyrdom not as it has necessarily to be experienced but in your willingness to bear it as being intrinsic to the faith is another wisdom to look upon yourself and understand the faith as an invitation to
01:24:23 -  martyrdom that is not to be decided in that final moment but now it's a mode of being it's a way of life by which your life is not your own and those that overcome do not hold their life as dear to themselves there's something more
01:24:36 -  dear to themselves than their own life it's another wisdom what is more dear than their life is the purpose of God is the honor of God is the glory of God and they have settled that so let's pray for that church my God Lord save us from
01:24:56 -  system save us from prestige save us from title save us from all those kinds of things that have seduced and nullified some of the bravest movements that have ever had their origin in this earth that was born out of travail and
01:25:12 -  suffering and anguish and opposition and martyrdom and they come in time and accepted system look at the Methodist Church today an upper middle class institution for people who want a 45 minute service that will release them
01:25:26 -  for the golf course from a movement that fasted twice in the week by a founder who is up four o'clock every morning in his prayer chamber and walked into mobs that were ready to tear him limb from limb with complete boldness and calm
01:25:43 -  because his life was not his own a single man who stopped the French Revolution from coming to Great Britain and destroying that Anglo-Saxon heritage and soil out of which our own nation was birthed and had come one man four
01:25:59 -  o'clock in the prayer player every morning one man who lived for the glory of God one man who counseled those who followed him to fast to deny themselves to be disciplined that's why they were called Methodist they had a method and
01:26:15 -  what has that become today and the assemblies of God and Pentecostalism that has come out of that method of some institutions by and large of a self-perpetuating kind concern for the preservation of themselves more than the
01:26:32 -  issue of the glory of God the powers of the air therefore unchallenged unrecognized uncontended against influencing the lives of millions of victims who don't even know that they're being acted upon and denied essential
01:26:49 -  reality of what this purpose of life is about and only living for themselves and their gain their pleasure their satisfaction and are on their way to an eternal hell my God raised up a church whose very being is the wisdom of God
01:27:05 -  whose very face and voice and posture and gate indicates that there's eternity there's an eternity that means everything and that this life is the transient and passing thing and that the powers of the air have
01:27:19 -  controverted all of the values and taken the absolute and ultimate things of God and made them to sound cheap and passing and taken the cheap and passing things of football and basketball and sport and music and jazz and and all of that
01:27:33 -  nonsense and made that somehow to seem to be ultimate it's a controversial value for which people are dying until someone will identify it and blow the whistle not only by what they say but what they are together so do I
01:27:48 -  pray Lord blessing for this church the willingness to bear the kind of humiliation that I had only small opportunity to taste in these days and to remember that out of the mouth of babes out of the week out of the the
01:28:08 -  ones without prestige with ones without recognition comes the wisdom of God that stops the mouth of the adversary I bless this church Lord this is sacrifice this is suffering this is humiliation this is the cross keep us from programs that
01:28:27 -  have not first recognized until the powers are dealt with that hover over us and keep the locality bound our programs are going to bounce back with but little consequence they need first to be challenged and moved out of their
01:28:42 -  orbits by the presence of a people who are free from intimidation from fear from lust from desire for fame for recognition who will not themselves be intimidated nor intimidate others they will not so much as have the pianist
01:28:59 -  come up and to play on the platform as the invitation goes forth that that those that come might have a conducive emotional environment for their their response as I have had to tell musicians thank you but no thank you if they're
01:29:14 -  not going to come up by the power of God in the Word of God they don't need any additional accoutrement no I may be wrong in that Saints but I'd rather be wrong in that then go along with those conducive things that make us
01:29:31 -  manipulative even without our recognition and steal the the truth and the wisdom of God from the church Lord teach us these things give us an understanding bring us to be this people I bless them my God send them home with
01:29:52 -  something in their hearts and spirits that this is only the beginning of the opening of a massive cosmic subject that must be taken into their deepest consideration and all the faith considered in that context bless them
01:30:06 -  Lord let them affect their generation by defeating those powers that have not even been so much as recognized and wait for that one agency alone that can perform it the church that is the church I bless this church Lord thank
01:30:24 -  you for this word to them and this calling may they receive it with rejoicing and be that demonstration is my prayer in Jesus name amen in a moment we'll dismiss those who want to leave and invite everyone else to
01:30:40 -  come and spend time and the presence of the Lord I just want to say that this is a word from heaven sent by God to us here at fire I would say in our short history the most important message that God has sent us I believe to the extent
01:30:57 -  we respond to it and continue to do so I believe that God has sent us to the And to whatever extent we have blind spots and don't see where we're not conforming to this I trust that God will show us and speak to us in
01:31:13 -  particular that have responsibility for leading the flock so may God give us ears to hear and just so you understand even this whole night right at the outset there was one brother that I knew there were some things out of order and
01:31:27 -  I was convinced that he was going to be a good brother and that he was going to be a disruption so the moment he opened his mouth that's why I jumped on it this has been a sacred night that God wants to guard make sure you read carefully
01:31:39 -  the chapters in art's book in particular that speak to this let's get the tape let's make this part of us let's take it before the Lord let's pray it through we've been birthed for this purpose and I believe that we're young enough in our
01:31:53 -  development that we can really honor God in this and live according to his will that we can really honor God in this and live according to this so let's all stand and those that want to go please leave quietly and take this before the
01:32:10 -  Lord as you leave those that want to come forward and spend some time before the Lord responding please do so we don't judge things by your outward response but those that would like to take some time come forward or stand
01:32:23 -  your seats and we'll request that those that want to talk about anything could just please go outside and do it so that those that want to stand their seats can Lord thank you again for your grace Lord may we be very sensitive now that no
01:32:37 -  birds of the air will come and steal things because there are many things that you've spoken to many individuals may we have ears to hear in Jesus name amen if there's something specific God's dealt with you about a course of action
01:32:51 -  or something he requires you write it down before you leave don't just think you remember write it down take hold of it God bless you we'll see you tomorrow at new hope at seven
