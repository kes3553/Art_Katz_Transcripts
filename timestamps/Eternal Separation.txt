Eternal Separation

00:00 -  There's nothing that we could do or that could deserve or merit. Hell could there? Are you guys letting this sink in? I'm speaking for myself. I want this to sink in to me. Until hell is really believed and
00:19 -  is anguished over and is made and communicated to be the terrible eternal Calamity that it is it is the ultimate calamity There's there's no turning back. There's no remedy. There's no second chance
00:37 -  There's no way to make amends because now you realize that what you had spurned In those who had preached to you and witnessed to you is in fact true and
00:50 -  You can't undo the death of those four girls or those 14 students But whatever it is, it doesn't require mass
01:01 -  Slaughter to justify hell Just being a man in the world indifferent to God and full of lies and
01:11 -  untruth and Conduct contrary to God's requirement that we should be holy as he hold as he is holy is sufficient qualification Well, this is a real tough one
01:25 -  Because is that our God it sounds so vindictive so Unrelieved Surely there's got to be a little
01:38 -  Footnote a little something by which God can still be vindicated. He can't be that unjust He can't be that demanding He can't be that
01:48 -  absolute in the end Determining and the eternal destiny of millions For which there's no remedy who will be an eternal torment of darkness or fire
02:02 -  To believe that and to believe that that is foundational to the understanding of the Christian faith Is either something terribly wrong or something terribly, right? It seems that the great revivals in America the early 18th century and I've got a message from Jonathan
02:24 -  Edwards here believed in hell and spoke of it so persuasively as
02:31 -  Finney did later That people clutched the pillars of the church They could feel the heat coming through the floor the flames of hell were already scorching the soles of their feet
02:42 -  They they phoned at the mouth they fell and they were carried Out or they were brought to a anxious what they called up the anxious bench Where people would then wrestle with their souls over these issues and they didn't expect you to come through the same night
03:01 -  You may have gone home Anguishing in your soul about your eternal condition and may have taken two or three days before there was a final breakthrough But when it came people were not just merely saved they were converted
03:16 -  Entire communities were converted the saloons were emptied the jails were emptied There was a sweep of God in power When men came pronouncing the reality of eternal judgment and hell without compromise or equivocation
03:32 -  Because Finney sent his prayer man into those communities two to three weeks in advance of his coming So that prayer intercession of the deepest kind would precede his speaking But the results were remarkable
03:52 -  We have not seen anything like that since that time because we're not preaching anything like that since that time So what Psalm 73 seems to indicate Is that though a psalmist surely?
04:08 -  Is as well-informed as any of us of the issues of eternity of judgment and reward He did not understand them sufficiently He didn't yet understand them
04:22 -  Existentially in his deeps Because he was vexed in his soul. He was torn Because he could not reconcile a moral God
04:34 -  With conditions that prevail in this life by which the wicked get away with murder Daily even insulting God verbally and even saying where is God while the righteous? Who who want to serve God and walk in the way they are them?
04:51 -  they are chasing daily and and and and Are beset with difficulties and problems whereas the evil are having a field day So long as that prevails and you have to ask the question. Where is God?
05:08 -  There's no talking of any kind of morality and to and to void the word morality Is to lose the entire game Because if we grow up without a moral sense and the imperative
05:25 -  Importance of having a moral Sensitivity of being moral human beings we're finished sense the issue of what is moral is the issue of what is human and
05:41 -  I'm saying if God can be dismissed as himself lacking a moral universe What basis is there for morality at all? And you know what the answer is what makes this universe moral is?
05:55 -  Not that men get away in this lifetime with murder But that in the life to come after they get their just and do reward
06:06 -  That is to say if there was no eternal judgment This whole present life would be without reason and Men can get away with murder literally if there's no fear of the consequence in the life to come
06:25 -  And I'm believing that God in his wisdom has designed hell and created it Not just as the of for what people will suffer in in the life to come Well that it should be presently considered
06:40 -  taken into our present consideration that we should walk in fear and trepidation and caution
06:51 -  Knowing that a misstep and a and a series of action can bring us into that eternal state God intended the consideration of hell to be the most tempering sane factor for living right righteously in this life and
07:12 -  Because it has not been for us a real consideration We're living sloppily
07:20 -  Shallowly Connolly and the and the rest how does a minister whether he's black or white? allow himself a
07:30 -  Fornication with numbers of women and girls within his own congregation as if it is right. I Mentioned this in Staten Island on my way through here and a very precious black brother who's a Minister and has been concerned for this that arty you need to understand in black history
07:53 -  Men have been so deprived of their masculinity their identity as men. They were just merchandise Men could be separated from their wives and their children and sold to one owner and the wives and children can go to another and so There are many factors that explain why it is in the
08:14 -  Insecurity and the lack of true identity of oneself as a man There's a drivenness
08:22 -  To prove it to demonstrate it sexually by having these surreptitious supplementary Relationships that can be justified is what he's telling me don't see what I'm saying
08:38 -  Here's what I'm saying, I don't care I mean I care Understand history. I'm a history teacher. I Understand that generations can be affected
08:51 -  for many generations to come by the ugly things of the past slavery and the Injustice of it the mistreatment of it and the way that men were reduced. I Can understand that there'd be a fact the psychologically by which a man would?
09:09 -  Need to assert himself Sexually to prove his masculinity as a reflection of that history Except that we're not at Liberty
09:22 -  To make that our excuse We're not at Liberty to cite history to justify our present weakness or conduct Yes, you may have every reason
09:34 -  to have an affair because of the of the past
09:40 -  But a righteous God says that that's evil And for you to conduct yourself in it is to make yourself a
09:54 -  candidate for the loss of your salvation and for an eternal torment of suffering and judgment got the idea God has given us a counterbalancing factor
10:09 -  in the calamity of eternal judgment that
10:17 -  compensates or Puts At a distance any justification that we could find for self-indulgence
10:29 -  Self-gratification lust dishonesty evil lies wickedness and death But our age Finds reasons that even this man who killed these four girls
10:47 -  Well, he lost the baby nine years ago, and he's never fully recovered how by the sudden removal of that child that was born to them and even in his early history he himself May have been sexually what do they call it?
11:04 -  Offended what he himself indulged so already the world is finding social and psychological
11:12 -  explanations to mitigate the evil and make it a non evil for which he's not responsible How could he help it? And God is saying I don't care what your sociology is. I don't care what your history is
11:28 -  You need to know that the soul that sins it shall die That there's a death That comes to every man and then the judgment
11:43 -  No soul shall be absolved from facing the judge and paying eternally the consequence of sin and
11:53 -  This man did not see it until he went into the sanctuary So long as he was content to be merely Doctrinally correct. He didn't see it in the anguished
12:06 -  But his anguish drove him into the sanctuary that is to say to find the answer of God And you know what he found Then I understood in verse 17 their end I
12:23 -  I Took the yellow marker and I put their end in yellow You can underline it and put an asterisk unless we understand the end
12:37 -  We don't understand at all dear Saints The church has been deprived
12:46 -  of its understanding of the full faith and message of God For which there is an end but it's not an end as
12:58 -  termination or obliteration It's an end of judgment that is eternal and does not cease in its burnings and in its Torment that's the end
13:12 -  The end is an eternal continuation of your consciousness suffering the just reward of the evil that you allowed yourself in this life and
13:25 -  Now is fine. It's too late to remedy How many people would think twice before considering
13:36 -  sexually molesting Amish girls or killing them if they if they knew that If they knew that merely to put a bullet in your own brain does not end anything You'll find yourself dear brother in that moment in hell
13:55 -  with a full consciousness of who you are and what you have done and what you are suffering now in torment even before the day of judgment in which you will be united with your body and stand before the judge and Receive an eternal judgment of which your present. Hell is only the preliminary
14:17 -  Let's turn to Luke. I think it's 16 It's called a parable. I didn't tell you what happened at the University of Illinois When the guy asked me that question
14:28 -  You believe in hell cats Come on, you're a university graduate yourself You're a man in your right mind
14:35 -  Hell is an embarrassment Hell is for simpletons Hell is for manipulating the masses in fear
14:44 -  Surely a man as erudite as yourself Could not can you could not really ever give credibility to such a notion as hell So what is your message then and what is the gospel predicated?
15:01 -  Upon judgment by which we are saved by the blood of Jesus rendered at the cross See the cross means nothing and salvation is nothing if there's not a hell from which we're to be saved
15:15 -  So that Paul and Thessalonians says to the new converts I Praise God That when you heard the word of God from me you received it for what it was not the word of man, but the word of God
15:29 -  Which performs a work in them that believe that turn you from your idols to serve the living God and to wait for his son Who comes from heaven and will save you from the wrath to come? These Thessalonians believe in the salvation
15:47 -  That would save them not only presently but eternally from the wrath to come Wrath means The anger of God the righteous anger of God
16:03 -  that when his face when he comes as judge in the wrath of the lamb as it is described in Revelation men who had mocked him and
16:16 -  Fought nothing of him look for places in the rocks to hide and Crevices and cracks that would save them from having to see the face of
16:29 -  the wrath of God in Jesus It's a wrath
16:34 -  That is not a last moments impetuous Irritation his wrath is not like a little anger His wrath is a deep deep
16:47 -  Thing that has been Simmering in his eternal depths through all of the history of mankind watching and observing the conduct the attitudes the speech of
17:01 -  Millions that are contrary to him and to his holiness and there comes a day in which He will express that wrath in judgment He'll bring it into the earth when he comes and men who have found sinners
17:17 -  Will suffer that wrath Eternally if they are not saved by the blood of the lamb That saves them from the wrath to come
17:28 -  You know, we don't believe that Saints were not saved enough We're saved. What shall I say? Superficially, but we need to be saved from the wrath to come
17:41 -  Because We know that wrath is fearful and the consequence of that wrath is Immeasurable and it's a justified anger. It's not God on some petty trip
17:58 -  He's ventilating and expressing his righteous Indignation in a world that has blasts blasphemed against him and sinned Horribly
18:11 -  Taken its liberties in lust and blood and death and violence as If there was no price to pay in the life to come as if this life was everything and you can get away with it So if he did not come to bring an eternal judgment, where is there any basis for morality and
18:36 -  And so in 16 Verse 19 there was a certain rich man
18:45 -  Clothed in purple and fine linen and fed sumptuously every day. This sounds like the same kind of people That the ASAP was describing in Psalm 73 living it up having a ball no need best of all worlds and
19:04 -  In contrast, there's a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sauce and Desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table more over the dogs came and licked his source
19:20 -  It doesn't say that he ever received any crumbs Or any kind of consideration from the rich man very likely. He was completely dismissed and Therefore he forsook all
19:34 -  righteousness in in giving out of his abundance to alleviate the distress of one as Pitiful as Lazarus and that's not just a moment's inconsideration
19:48 -  That's the statement of all of his years of all of his life We can almost surmise that he was rich because that's the way he lived He did not give away of his substance to the poor he was indifferent and you know
20:05 -  That the poor are poor for the purposes of God The poor are poor as a test For the righteousness of mankind the whose midst they are placed
20:18 -  And it's interesting that in the last and the first judge And the Lord comes as king goats is over the question. What have you done for the least of these my brethren? So there's a remarkable
20:37 -  corollary here in the comparison of these two men The wealthy man who lacks nothing and the poor beggar Who could not even obtain crumbs
20:51 -  And It came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and
21:03 -  in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and see if Abraham afar off and
21:12 -  Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on Me and said Lazarus that he might dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue For I am tormented in the flames
21:27 -  You know dear Saints You don't have to be PhD or a Bible scholar
21:36 -  Just to come to certain fundamental reckonings on the basis of this text which Jesus himself is citing And that not the least of the basic understandings is that though this man died his consciousness was not obliterated
21:54 -  It did not mean the end of himself as an entity Any more than it meant that for the man who blew his brains out after killing those four Amish girls Death does not end
22:09 -  Death only precipitates to being cast into the place of eternal judgment instantly For the moment he died and he was buried he was aware That he was in torment he was in hell
22:28 -  And was able to see Lazarus in a much more than a much better place and even to request could Lazarus be sent Just to dip his finger in water and to touch my tongue because this heat and this burning is an
22:46 -  Anguish and an agony and a torment beyond all consideration You know I've never preached this text before But maybe it's time
22:58 -  To ask is the Lord Himself cites this the Lord is giving this as an example Would he would he speak these words lightly if they were not if there was not corresponding truth would he Exaggerate just to create fear would he say that there's torment when there is no torment in hell
23:20 -  So, you know what my answer was for that student catch do you believe in hell What what was I four or five years old in the Lord? I don't think I ever Seriously could ever consider the question. I didn't have a little
23:32 -  Alphabetical book with I could turn to H and see what it says about hell and be saved from this predicament I can only trust God Who brought me to this place and knew that everything would depend on my answer to that man
23:49 -  If I if the Lord failed to give an answer to that man over the question of hell No matter no meetings that would follow in philosophy classes in Jewish Fraternity houses and in any public place and I was in every place
24:05 -  We would succeed that meeting that in which this man stumbled in in one of the classrooms of Vietnamese veteran crocked out on drugs and fell to the floor as I was speaking that when I finished I
24:21 -  Opened up for questions the students began to attack me and this man got to his feet and he said what are you guys doing? He says can't you see that God is in this place? and he got saved and
24:36 -  I just saw him in Switzerland Only weeks or months ago. He said artists 31 years from the day that I stumbled into that room at the University of Illinois crocked out on drugs and
24:49 -  Heard you speak under the anointing of God and got saved that man today is that the highest echelons of Youth with a mission
25:00 -  He's a professor. He's a PhD. He's he's the head of their international university. He's the head of their French work in the world He's the one who arranged for the meetings at Lausanne Switzerland where I would speak on the subject of apostolic foundations Which book is available because he opened the door for that speaking?
25:20 -  Because at the University of Illinois at a certain moment He came stumbling into a room in which the power of God on me was so great that he fell to the floor and Contradicted these students who wanted to jump me
25:33 -  And it all went back to the answer. Do you believe in hell cats? Of course, I believe in hell. I like I believe in heaven, you know, I believe in the faith, you know But there's believing and believing
25:47 -  And so I opened my mouth and so far as I can reconstruct what I said This is what came out of me. I Said you dare
25:58 -  Man, I think I called him that He was an ups smart Alec snot nose
26:07 -  Wanting to ridicule me and end something before it began I Said, you know No one has spoken more prolifically on hell than Jesus himself
26:19 -  You know, that's true you'll find no one in the prophets or in the New Testament or even Paul Speaking more prolifically about hell than Jesus himself. And what we're considering in Luke 16 is a statement from Jesus And I said he said that we should be held accountable
26:37 -  For every idle word we speak and he himself never spoke an idle word Therefore I would commend to you to take seriously His speaking of hell as an eternal
26:53 -  Torment and a fire that will not be quenched lest you find yourself more soon than you know facing its prospect Something like that
27:06 -  It was like boom a blast from God where I watched this guy just Shrivel and get blown out of the room and then the Lord went on So I'm reminded of it being reminded of that tonight with this subject of hell
27:25 -  This guy put his finger on the critical question If we don't believe in hell and there's not a hell to believe in We're robbed of the appropriate fear
27:38 -  That is a that is becoming to the church as the church and The most serious omission in the church worldwide as I have the privilege to observe it in my travels Is this one thing the absence of the fear of God?
27:55 -  That ministers can fornicate Take liberties come unprepared
28:03 -  Speak just to play upon the emotional strings that they know that they can affect because they're they're smart operators Have no concern for the Word of God or seeing to the growth of the maturity of the of their flock But just getting by so that they can support the lifestyle that they enjoy and appreciate by playing the game
28:27 -  There's no fear in such men Because there's no fear of the eternal consequence of their disobedience to God and Their failure to be serious servants in the high calling of God in which we're told as it in Hebrews
28:43 -  Let not many of you be teachers of the word for teachers of the word come under a double judgment Fear needs to be restored to the church and
28:56 -  It will not be restored Until we reckon on the the foundational fear itself the fear of eternal hell as Torment which this rich man is now
29:10 -  experiencing and what Answer does he get?
29:15 -  about send Lazarus that he might touch my tongue But Abraham said son
29:24 -  Remember that thou in thy lifetime received the good things and Likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted and thou are tormented and beside all this Between us and you there was a great gulf
29:39 -  Fixed you got your yellow marker mark the word fixed
29:46 -  Fixed is finality Fixed is Absoluteness
29:53 -  Fixed means no further recall No opportunity to amend or alter The condition that has come it is
30:03 -  fixed permanent enduring
30:07 -  Eternal if we really believe this we ought to be pleading with men We ought to be pleading with youth Lest they be cut off in their youth and be plunged into eternity without remedy because it is
30:26 -  fixed So that they which pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us and would come from this There's no two-way traffic here. It's all over buddy
30:39 -  We can't send anybody to you. You can't say anybody to us. There's a There is a abyss There's something fixed by which there's no possibility ever again of
30:53 -  Communing between these two spheres you are fixed in hell. He's fixed in heaven And he and there's nothing that could be sent to you and there's no relief that can come to you This is your eternal state you lived it up in this world. You enjoyed luxury
31:09 -  You let this beggar come to your gate. You couldn't even find them a crumb Because you were unrighteous Because you had no consideration for God
31:19 -  Because you did not even understand that this beggar was at your gate because of God He was not an accident he was a he was someone that God allowed to suffer poverty and
31:33 -  To be a beggar to test you to save you if if you could yet recognize it from an eternal fate Of an anguish beyond all description if you had Recognized God was trying to speak to you and show you your unGodliness and your unrighteousness
31:52 -  By which you gathered for yourself remarkable wealth and lived high on the hog and had every advantage while you let this guy to wither and
32:03 -  others like him at your very doorstep and You spurned God's attempt to bring you to conviction About righteousness because the purpose of this life on earth is not to acquire
32:19 -  immeasurable wealth and a soft and comfortable Lifestyle of luxury the purpose of this life is to fit yourself for eternity
32:31 -  Is to walk righteously with God and To know him and to believe his judgments and his laws And to serve him and to walk in the way everlastingly and receive the reward of another kind
32:50 -  Too late it's fixed and so the This rich man said I pray thee therefore in verse 27 father
32:59 -  That you would send him to my father's house for a five brothers that he might testify unto them that they also That they lest they also come unto this place Torment their candidates for hell just the same kind as I myself am
33:17 -  Send a warning Save them from this torment and Abraham said to him they have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them If they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead
33:32 -  You'll soon have company your five brothers will join you But there'll be no comfort in that You'll all suffer the same
33:42 -  Affliction you'll be under the same Torment under the relentless heat which is described as fire and Someone in one of my recent reading says it doesn't mean that it's fire as we know it in the earthly realm
33:58 -  It may be fire of an entirely other kind Because they're not consumed by it, but they experience the heat and the torment of it Frankly dear church I have the strength to believe that God himself has established this
34:20 -  That the God who is the God of mercy and grace and kindness can allow for this eternal thing and That he himself has established it as Being altogether just and righteous that those who suffer it have deserved this
34:39 -  Penalty they have forsaken every warning they have not read they have not been willing to receive Testimony They have spurned people who have spoken to them about the Lord
34:51 -  They would not hear they would not consider and now when the time came and their iniquity was full boom They find themselves right at the moment of death in hell conscious aware of who they are and where they are and
35:07 -  suffering to a man So on that basis I have to believe that this milkman Who shot up those Amish girls and killed himself in that moment?
35:20 -  Wake to find out he's not really dead He's physically dead Humanly speaking in the world, but he's eternally and consciously alive
35:31 -  And he is in hell right now in torment Even before the judgment that will be pronounced upon him eternally and
35:43 -  It's fixed if the poor sap knew it Even suspected it would he have gone ahead to the hardware store to buy the Vaseline the lubrication I don't know what he was going to do with it
35:57 -  Evidently sexually molest these girls and the various other he planned and plotted this entire thing without a thought of What the consequence would be eternally Didn't he know that when he let those take the teacher out and the other adults and the male students
36:13 -  That's only a matter of time before the police would come and the moment that they came He shot up those kids and and killed himself thinking it's over But dear Saints we need to know it's not over when it's over
36:28 -  And because we don't believe that deeply believe that we were not able to warn men Paul said knowing the fear of God I persuade men
36:41 -  well, even our own ministers are not persuaded and Are taking liberties which if they continue in it, you know what their eternal place will be one of my concerns
36:54 -  addressing the black church Is who are you cats to be such a spokesman and to address that church? Won't they suspect that you're just whitey and you're just speaking out of your white preference and your own culture your own background
37:13 -  Yes, there's that risk if that the Lord would Give me the give the grace to show That art is not speaking out of his own racial identity
37:24 -  He's not speaking out of his own cultural background. He's speaking out of a transcendent place in God That's beyond the issue of race and beyond the issue of culture And now I've got to believe tonight
37:38 -  That that's true for what I'm speaking here That this is not a man just being petulant and celebrating hell Because he wants these guys who blow up these Amish girls to get what they deserve
37:52 -  But that there's something grievously wanting in the church because we've not been vexed Over the issue of the disparity that the rich are having a ball and the poor Are being vexed and chastened
38:07 -  Where's God's justice if there's not an eternal Place by which whatever is lacking in this life and judgment is made up there relievers thou this
38:21 -  That you can get away with murder in this life but oh When the end comes
38:32 -  That is Fixed and a just and righteous God will bring to recall every episode every indulgence
38:43 -  every sin every lust every disregard of himself in his way by which you have had a ball and Trafficked and and got away with it thinking that there's no God even to see up to observe little to take note or measure
39:00 -  But in eternity In what follows this life that comes after for which this life is only a moment there
39:14 -  Justice and righteousness will be served to the letter so This is the only way I knew to begin tonight
39:24 -  Just join with me in your spirit Lord. What kind of a church are we? We're not able to persuade men Because we ourselves do not know the fear of God
39:37 -  We've been getting away with murder We do not live as if we're being seen observed as if you're keeping books That one day we'll have to look straight into your face and be without excuse
39:53 -  That we can't talk about well, we black men have certain Justification because in the early days of slavery even till now We have been denied the full expression of our masculinity and now we feel that we were right and free entail
40:11 -  You just take one look at his face Look into the face of the judge and see his scars That he bore at the cross and you won't even begin to make an excuse of self-justification
40:25 -  For there is none We're all accountable before God And we can't find justification for evil and wickedness on the basis of the past or that we were deprived
40:38 -  Or that when we were kids we were children we we were molested or we lacked this or we lacked that There is no excuse We're responsible before God
40:50 -  He would have given us every grace To live righteously before him for he said to Abraham walk thou before me and be thou perfect For I am God
41:04 -  Almighty And that's a statement to every son and daughter of Abraham Walk before me not the world not its style be perfect and it's going to be hard
41:17 -  But I'm God Almighty. I'll give you every grace That when I come in the day of my appearing you'll not be ashamed You'll be able to face me not with fear. You'll look for a cracks in the rock to hide
41:32 -  You'll be looking forward to seeing me you're longing for my appearing for you look to receive a reward and not a penalty So my God Shall the church ever be the church?
41:49 -  Until these foundational things are restored Come my God and light a fire within us Bring your fear
41:58 -  Show us how lopsided we have been We've not given the things that are eternal the kind of consideration that they deserve and we've given to this life Which is only a momentary a whisper a vapor and undo attention
42:15 -  So we bless you Lord We're not asking that the black church Should just be lifted up a notch and be saved from the terrible horror of men who fornicate and take liberties
42:27 -  We're asking that the black church should be the example for all the church of America of what a righteous people are that do not look upon their condition or their race or the Injustices which they have suffered and continue to suffer as any kind of justification
42:48 -  For acting in a way contrary to God. Oh My God Lord bless us Restore the things
42:57 -  That have been neglected Use this beginning as you will We thank you and praise you if we've heard your heart tonight
43:07 -  Continue with us my God So much as is in your heart to do and we thank you and give you praise in Jesus name God's people said
