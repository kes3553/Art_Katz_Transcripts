Jacob Wrestling K 530

00:00 -  I guess the only subject I can speak about tonight is wrestling but praise God that there's a wrestling match that's described in the Bible that I think is fantastically significant and I've always had a very deep respect for
00:14 -  wrestling myself not that I wrestled to chicken I guess or not a physical type but I remember as a high school teacher I had kids in my class who are I almost say zombies there was nothing I could do to get a rise out of them. Can you hear me in the back?
00:28 -  Okay I used to dance on my head and do pirouettes and leap across the desk and every dramatic stunt that I could think of I was trying to persuade these kids that it just wasn't the history class that this had to do with life and
00:42 -  reality and death and still they sat like zombies they never batted their eyelashes and I remember one time in my desperate frustration I said if you'll not believe and what I'm trying to convey is real that I'm going to take
00:56 -  out this revolver from my desk drawer and blast my brains and my blood all over your mott clothes and still I looked up and you know I had an amazing revelation one day every Friday some of us old crocs used to go to gymnasium and
01:14 -  work out and I saw some of the same kids who were zombies in my class come alive on the wrestling mat it was fantastic the transformation the same one that didn't stir or blink an eyelash there are with my profundities in the
01:30 -  classroom on the wrestling mat I saw these guys alive to the extremity into the fingertips and I've always had a deep respect for wrestling and I think that the Greeks properly recognized that it was the supreme sport because I don't
01:45 -  think that there's a sport that takes more of the totality of what a man is than a wrestling match I mean it's not just your physical strength and it's not just your skill it's not just your determination but I mean it's every last
02:01 -  iota of your being and all that you are and as we do say right out of her tishkas it's deep unto deep and eyeball to eyeball and if there's anything that tests a man in the extremity of the totality of its life it's wrestling
02:20 -  and I have a plan to speak on wrestling tonight they say that the answer in the book for every situation there's a wrestling match that's described in this book that I think is fantastic and it's something that's reminiscent of my life
02:36 -  and I think for that reason I'm rather partial to it's a wrestling match that a man had with a stranger one day by the name of Jacob and you know there's something about Jacob that has its counterpart in the modern world there's
02:49 -  a certain Jacob spirit in the world Jacob is a well-meaning guy he's even a guy who appreciates spiritual things but he's a bit of a wheeler and a dealer he's a guy who lives always in the last analysis by his own resources his own
03:08 -  wits and his own determination and isn't that really the epitome of what modern like this and the Lord you know what that means he's a God unto himself and guys I wish we had a lot of time tonight but we don't and I'm gonna have to be
03:21 -  very brief I'm gonna ask you to be students as you've never been it and ask you to extend yourself and read between the lines of the things that I'm trying to suggest and here's what I'm trying to suggest that this is an age in
03:35 -  crisis this is an age of extremity and I don't know if that's as pointed and as understandable in North Carolina as it is where I'm living in Denmark or some of the places that I've been in the world in great cities and seen a growing tide
03:52 -  of filth and obscenity and perversion Satanism witchcraft rebellion and death if you don't know these facts now I can assure you that these are going to be the essential facts of your generation and it's everything that the scriptures
04:06 -  had been telling us if we had ever disposed ourselves to read them that in the last days perilous times would come and then would be lovers of self and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God it doesn't say that the world would
04:21 -  be devoid of religion in these last days quite the contrary there even is going to be a kind of a renaissance of religion but praise God I'm not speaking to you tonight about religion she is very easy for Jacob to be religious it's
04:34 -  very easy for a man who's a God unto himself and living for the pursuit of his own pleasure and his own gratification to throw God a bone on Sunday or the Shabbos or the high holidays or Christmas and Easter and I
04:47 -  would say that about nine out of ten people in this room fit that category and you come out of families which I have perfectly described your Sunday Christians or Easter or Christmas Christian so-called and if someone asks
04:58 -  you are you a Christian? Well yes, what else? I'm not a Moslem. Jacob was a superficially religious man and it's interesting that he had two encounters with God before he came to a very real showdown and although our
05:16 -  speech might have a lot of approximate terms and many vagaries and we say yes but maybe I'll tell you something about the Word of God it's very sharp it's very lean it's very sparse there's not an extra syllable or a piece of
05:31 -  superfluous utterance or a comma or punctuation is out of place I really commend it to you read it and and see how that thing goes right through your heart like a knife and you know the two encounters that Jacob had with God and
05:45 -  I'm talking about the God of Abraham Isaac the God of Israel there's no other Gods that when God introduced himself to Jacob when he had a vision a dream at night with his head on a rock in the wilderness and he saw a ladder
05:57 -  with angels ascending descending and the Lord was at the top of it and spoke to him he said I am the God of your father Abraham and the God of your father Isaac and the land whereupon thou liest to thee will I give it you know sometimes
06:10 -  we have to read the Word of God not only for what God says but for what God leaves out I'm the God of your father Abraham and the God of your father Isaac and he stopped right there he didn't say I'm Jacob's God because he was not and
06:25 -  that's the point guys he's nobody's God automatically he's nobody's God by virtue of birth by virtue of being Jewish or circumcised or bar mitzvah or necessarily baptized or sprinkled or confirmed or any of the thousands of
06:41 -  religious things which we do as part and parcel of our religious or cultural tradition what it takes to make a Jacob to make the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac the God of Jacob was a wrestling match no holes but gut to gut
06:57 -  and eyeball to eyeball and it's interesting how God patiently brought Jacob to just such that a place is that in my prayer for every one of you precious young people tonight is that you won't have to wait too long for that
07:09 -  encounter as a matter of fact it's available tonight right where you sit and where you stand and I pray that you won't have to wait as this Jacob waited and as long as the my God waited for me to come to the end of my conceit and my
07:22 -  arrogance and my self-assurance and my Jacob life until in my 35th year I wrestled with exactly that same person that my forefather Jacob wrestled with with the exact same result I want to describe that wrestling match it came
07:39 -  at the extremity of Jacob's life what does it take guys you have an eye any idea of how eminently superficial we are you have an idea of how phony we are how shallow how casual how indifferent the thing that brought me to the end of
07:57 -  myself in my 34th year and fantastically it came at a time when I finally arrived when I was finally a success I would have been a high school dropout at the age of 16 and a wandering human a bum and a merchant seamen and a drifter and
08:12 -  a guy who tried his hand at every vocation relationship and girl and cause an ideology was finally a high school teacher and my mother was throwing out her chest with pride and Brooklyn speaking about my son the professor I
08:26 -  tell you she had every bit of exaggeration coming because I had given that poor woman so many gray hairs and she had made so many trips up to the principal's office what her son had done this time and now she could say my son
08:39 -  the professor and I was being applauded by my students and by my colleagues and this is fantastic in the very ear of my success when I finally attained that in which I have been striving all my life I realized what a failure I was the
08:51 -  Americans say that there's nothing that succeeds like success and I want to tell you that that's completely wrong there's nothing that fails like success because once you've arrived you realize just how hollow you want your victory is ashes in
09:04 -  your mouth and which are the nations today that are dying who are the ones that are cheating on each other's wives attempting orgies drugs and every kind of hair rain and erotic a stupid kind of contrivance to fill the hollowness of
09:21 -  our lives but we who are affluent and successful and God had a what has had a way for a Jacob to come to the end of himself and he would have to wait for me he's waiting for you he's waiting for the modern world to come to the end of
09:34 -  its games plane the end of its shallow religiosity the end of talking about religion what you call a Judaism of Christianity or whatever but still effectively being lords unto yourself and Jacob came to that place that I
09:46 -  came and I came because I thought that you guys were my hope oh I believe that young people were uncorrupted and unfaithful and somehow in a classroom that we could develop a pattern of life which we could all offer to the world of
09:57 -  true brotherhood and compassion and blah blah blah that's what I thought but you know what I learned you guys are not one with difference difference than anybody in the world you're just a bit younger but you exhibit the self same nature
10:16 -  their self same Jacob nature that's pitting nation against nation and class against class and race against race and you said I'm not that way but that's what I thought I was at the root guys were selfish you know I was made to say
10:32 -  oh my kids could cry it here for Biafra and for Vietnam and they could adopt my humanistic rhetoric and my slogans but I saw where they really lived and where they really trembled in the kishkas and you'll learn anything else from me tonight
10:45 -  you can learn what kishkas mean in the center and the in the end that's where we live out of the heart God says proceed all the issues of life and not at the surface and many of us have not found God because he's not to be found
11:01 -  at the surface he's a deep calling unto deep waiting for us to come to the end of ourselves and mean business and engage him and not let him go except that he blesses although my kids could speak the same kind of humanistic vocabulary as
11:16 -  I I saw where they really trembled and live and I saw that it was a more paralyzing predicament for a girl to be flat-chested than for millions to die in Biafra Vietnam yes or no I saw that for guy to be stood up on a date or to be
11:33 -  dejected or rejected and not to have the horsepower that he thinks his car should was for him the real issue of his life and it's fantastic now the matter what we profess with our mouths and no matter what handsome rhetoric we can
11:45 -  speak our real tremblings and the real fluctuations of our heart give us a way and if there are some adults with us tonight don't don't you think that you're any more superior all you've done is graduate to other kinds of toys and I
12:00 -  don't care whether it's missiles or getting to the moon it's the same stupid games playing it's the same evasion it is the same rude selfishness and self-gratification and not okay what religion you've garnished your life with
12:12 -  you still are Lord unto yourself and you do not know me and so God waited for Jacob to come to the extremity of his life as I came in my 34th year as an atheist from the age of 14 I had done my religious thing I had gratified my
12:27 -  mother went to Hebrew school as well I miss it and all that jazz and I never docked into a synagogue doorstep again because I was not looking for listen I was looking for life and for reality and for truth and it was not to be found
12:39 -  there and nor in any Gentile equivalent to my Jewish religion when I came to the end of myself I was led by God in a step-by-step encounter which this book describes that was held up tonight a journal which I kept eight years eight
12:53 -  years ago in a 14-month trip 30,000 miles with a pack on my back over Western Europe North Africa the Middle East Egypt and the Holy Land looking for philosophical answers to the predicament of my life knowing that I was a man at
13:06 -  the end of himself and at the extremity and then although I have been a Marxist and pragmatist and existentialist that those things were just vain vocabularies that could not transform the world because I needed transforming
13:18 -  and it wasn't to be obtained by mere words alone I knew I needed to be a new creature I needed to be something genuinely compassionate and loving and I could couldn't rev that up by any exertion of my own flesh I needed a
13:31 -  transcendent answer but where was that to be found in the God in a world without a God no real God had ever been displayed to me and we read that in the same crisis to which Jacob came in the 32nd chapter the book of Genesis that
13:50 -  in that crisis Jacob sent over all that he had his two wives his children his possessions all that he had striven for all of his life he knew now that none of these things could save him he would have to face his brother Esau who had had 14
14:06 -  years to nurse a spirit of resentment and Esau was coming with an army of 400 and to do him in and his wits this time and his cunning and his well-meaning intentions were not going to save him and we read in 24 verse and Jacob was
14:22 -  left alone that's the only way to meet guys meet God guys is alone wrestling match is between two personalities two persons you and a stranger who's been waiting for you it's not you with your rabbi or you with your priests or you
14:40 -  with your minister or your mother your father or anyone else you're going to meet him alone face to face on this side of eternity or you're going to meet him in exactly the same way on the other side and I tell you if I take my heart
14:51 -  out of out of my body and ring it out before you I would plead with you and beg you and induce you any way that I can to please meet him now it says Jacob was left all alone and they wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the
15:07 -  day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him this man this stranger he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said to Jacob let me go for the day
15:21 -  breaketh and Jacob said I'll not let me go except that thou bless me know whatever we can say about a Jacob he's a guy who appreciates the opportunity when he's got it he's making the most of it and whoever this stranger is whoever
15:37 -  this man is he recognizes that this man has some unusual capacity some endowment some power some authority to confer blessing and he said let me go for the day breaketh and Jacob said I'll not let me go except that thou bless me
15:53 -  and the stranger said to him what is thy name and he said Jacob you know there's something wonderful about God he always asks Socratic questions he always draws us out of ourselves either when he said in the form of Jesus who do men say that
16:09 -  I am or when he came into the garden of Adam and Eve and he said Adam where are you of course he knew where he was what is your name as if he didn't know and Jacob said Jacob that name means
16:27 -  deceiver supplanted conniver shrewd article and guys don't misconstrue anything I'm saying to suggest that this is any kind of an anti-semitic message or that I'm laying bare the anatomy of a Jewish personality not at
16:42 -  all I'm laying bare the anatomy of the modern world the Jacob spirit of the modern world and it's just as much the possession of Gentiles as it is of Jews what is that spirit it's the spirit of self sufficiency and independence from
16:58 -  God that sin that's the very essence of sin that's the root of sin and it makes us God unto ourselves no matter what vocabulary is we employ no matter what our liturgy no matter if we can speak Hebrew no matter how what religious
17:15 -  motions we go through until we've come to God and met him face to face and had him touch us and bless us and change our nature and our name and our character and our walk we're still Jacobs and God is seeking for people that he might call
17:33 -  Israel he wants to change our name and he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and the
17:52 -  stranger said wherefore is it that God does ask after my name and he blessed him there at this time in the revelation of God in the book of Genesis God couldn't say Jesus what would that mean God of course is always a God of progressive
18:07 -  revelation but I want to suggest to you that that stranger who wrestled with me seven years ago in Jerusalem who picked me up off the side of the road in Switzerland and would not let me go the stranger who put a book in my hands
18:19 -  aboard the deck of a tramp steamer which I had never before read and was contemptuous of as an atheist and the so-called intellectual was the same stranger and the stranger who put me on a bus at the Hebrew University in
18:29 -  Jerusalem and allowed me to get lost but I staggered out of that bus and walked into the first door that I could find and to ask directions to find out that I had walked into a bookstore that sold Bibles and New Testaments and Christian
18:40 -  literature and I looked at that Jewish woman's face and I said what is this place oh she said we're a congregation of Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus and this is our bookstore during our chapel and something in my heart went
18:50 -  click and I heard a still small voice guys you're gonna have to believe that no joke very important that you believe this because God has said art be a witness to every creature if they receive you they
19:04 -  receive me and if they receive me they receive him who sent me I tell you that I'm a man in my right mind I've got a master's degree from Berkeley and I was a man who had been a
19:14 -  lifelong atheist and who laughed and ridiculed and lampoon any references to God heaven hell devil and all of those categories who has learned that the very things
19:24 -  which I rejected in school are really the ultimate and most awesome realities of our life though they're invisible and I tell you that in that moment in that bookstore in Jerusalem seven years
19:32 -  ago I heard a still small voice and it called me by name art it said you're not to leave and I'll tell you the kind of Jew that I am when I hear that one voice alone
19:47 -  there's only one God guys there's only one voice there's only one still small voice that's ever been seeking us waiting for us to shut our Jacob mouths and our contention
19:58 -  and I was riding in our hot shot opinions and be still and know that I am God when I heard that still voice you know what I knew that's the one voice alone that has the authority and the right to command
20:10 -  this Jewish life I stayed four days and nights with those Jewish believers notice I don't use the word Christian I think most of you can understand why because my Jewish mother said that she was pelted by stones
20:24 -  on her way to school in London when she was a little girl that were thrown at her by Christians Noma not Christians Gentiles my mother thinks that Billy Graham and the pope and Adolf Hitler are all Christians
20:36 -  every Gentile is a Christian the Spanish Inquisition was the work of Christians the programs in Russian Poland the work of Christians the Holocaust the work of Christians
20:45 -  and I was on tv today what channel is that 24 28 turn turn it tomorrow night at 6 45 and listen to that 15 minute interview because I began by picking up the students your school school newspaper
20:57 -  today where it said our cast converted from christ and from a jew to being a christian are pox on that headline
21:15 -  the truth is this guys our cast graduated from being a jew by circumstances of birth to a jew in spirit and truth to a jew who knows the God of Israel and in whose life that God spirit dwells
21:31 -  who loves him with all his heart and soul and mind and strength and serves him that's what it means to be jewish and they've got that thing all wrong God isn't asking any of you jewish kids to
21:43 -  convert to christianity heck no who needs that arrow bloodless arid bloodless one-dimensional egg rolling and christmas tree uh grotesque culture
21:55 -  i tell you that our jewish culture is a lot more attractive and rich and deep and God isn't asking you in any way to sacrifice it he's only asking you to put at the center the God around whom it originally
22:04 -  developed the God of abraham isaac and jacob and the only way to do it is to make that God your God and you've got to come to him the same way abraham came to him by hearing a
22:14 -  still small voice and obeying it you've got to come to him the same way jacob came to him in a face-to-face encounter in which you will not let him go except that he bless him and i tell you
22:26 -  guys that when i wrestled with Jesus in that bookstore and aboard the deck of a ship or a tram steamer when i opened that new testament and one utterance from the lips of Jesus penetrated my mind and my heart
22:37 -  and went through me like a shockwave and left me a trembling deep aboard that deck i was an atheist the moment before and a month later i knew there's a living God i'm reading his book and Jesus is the
22:45 -  messiah of Israel but i didn't receive that revelation because it wasn't convenient in fact it was the most embarrassing and mortifying truth to which i had ever been exposed and my
22:55 -  first cry was why am i going to tell my mother because i knew she was going to be pained i knew the way she would interpret this and what was i going to tell my intellectual
23:06 -  colleagues in talifornia where i was the leading faculty radical why they were laughing at scorn coming back telling them that i believe that this book from genesis to revelation is the revealed
23:16 -  will of God and that Jesus is the messiah of Israel and all the world that i've been met of him and that his spirit is in me why they'll tell me that i've gone off the deep end and i need a psychiatrist
23:25 -  which is exactly what they told me they told me that my first night back when i was sitting in the perfect peace of God and these educated restless broken
23:37 -  adulterous fornicating lives every one of them every one of them seeing psychiatrists telling me who is enjoying the peace of God that i that i got off the deep end yes guys and intuitively they're right
23:53 -  the only way to know God is to go up the deep end he's not a God of convenience he's not a casual God he's not a God who shed his own blood and laid out his own life
24:03 -  that we might have a sunday culture he's a God who died who poured himself out who suffered the abuse of men rejected and despised of men a man of sorrows he had no comeliness that we
24:16 -  should desire him he gave his beard to the pluckers and his back to the smithers that we might have life and that more familiar he doesn't want us to be zombies he doesn't want us to be
24:26 -  so fabulous sleepwalking through life and going through motions of career and marriage and society he wants us to be alive to the extremity into the fingertips because we met him gut to gut and he
24:39 -  would not let him go except that he bless us and he alone with the power to bless him to touch touched us as he touched jacob and forever changed his nature and his name i think it's most revealing it says
24:52 -  in the 30th verse and jacob called the name of that place 10 i l for i have seen God face to face and my life is preserved who is the stranger the man with whom our father jacob wrestled
25:08 -  a lot of us are very clever in our theology and say oh God i i can't believe in Jesus God can never take on himself the form of a man oh really with whom did jacob wrestle gut to gut all through those night
25:26 -  hours in the most existential encounter of his life who touched him and had the power to bless him and to change his name and his character and his nature and jacob
25:37 -  says of him i have seen God face to face and my life is preserved i think what jacob really means is that a new life had been given because the scripture says no man can see God's face and live and that's true
25:52 -  jacob never survived that wrestling match a jacob died praise God is the only place where jacob but something was born in this world that's what happens when we meet God face to face
26:04 -  and i don't know if you noticed but i'm layman lyndon hault and just as it says of jacob and he passed over that the river panayel and the sun rose upon him and he limped upon his side
26:16 -  you know how you can know that you've had this encounter with God you'll never walk the same way again i haven't been walking the same way these last seven years as i walked the first 35 years of my life
26:26 -  i'll tell you what happened instantly seven years ago in jewsland when i went to sleep that last night i stayed four days and nights with those jewish believers and i saw jews pray with such power and
26:36 -  with such authority that that they have suggested to me that they really knew God and this wasn't just some ritualistic thing out of a sitter or prayer book when i saw my jewish people praising
26:46 -  God and worshiping him with their hands above their heads with joyous countenances and feeling faces and weeping however stupid i was i know that you don't learn that and you can't fabricate that there's
26:58 -  nothing faint about that it's an authentic expression of a people who have met God and know him and love him and can worship him
27:08 -  isn't it interesting that of all the things that Jesus said he said to a woman at the well that God the father how many Gods are there is seeking those who will worship him in the spirit and in truth
27:22 -  that's the whole issue guys our world is dying it's dying from secularism it's dying from the welter of goods we're dying from the pollution of our air and our morality
27:34 -  we're dying at every hand and i'll tell you why because God is effectively absent by his presence from our lives from our universities from our communities from our cities and from our nation and from
27:46 -  the world lots of religion lots of schmaltz and lots of uh practices and an empty ceremony but where is the presence of the holy one of Israel
27:58 -  who when he comes into a person changes his speech his conduct his manner his demeanor his posture his relationships no man is ever the same who once meets God face to face in his touch
28:13 -  he walks with a limp and isn't it interesting that where he touched jacob was in his stride i remember when i was a student of history and someone described petty result as a man who fought from his
28:23 -  strides masculine this is where the power is our bravado and our gusto and our presumption and our pride no man need think he's ever going to come to God
28:36 -  in that spirit but God says to us in the prophet isaiah upon this man will i look he who is of a broken and a contrite spirit will tremble at my word God wants to touch you and you will die
28:50 -  he wants to touch you in your arrogance and your conceit and your self-assurance and your bravado and your bluster and he wants to leave you lame or weak lonely
29:02 -  taking on even the nature of him who it is who wants to wrestle with you despised of men loving merciful the very attributes for the warmth of which this world is dying i'll tell you the
29:16 -  beautiful thing guys the same one who wrestled with jacob and the same one who wrestled with our tense is right in this balcony tonight waiting to wrestle
29:26 -  to touch the blessed and to change the life of any man or woman who will come to him in the only way that he'll receive us stripped naked there our pretenses our concealment our bluster and bravado
29:43 -  gone sending over all that we've had all alone willing to meet God face to face and not let him go except to be God has given i almost forgot to mention this
29:56 -  in that last night in jerusalem i went up to sleep on the front of a chapel agitated out of my skull i had tried by the power of my intellect to understand what God was trying to tell me i couldn't reconcile
30:09 -  how the God of Israel was calling me to be a christian and asking me to forsake my jewishness although the scriptures had been open to me and they showed me that with many many prophecies of a messiah to come
30:18 -  fulfilled by the Jesus of the new testaments and in my sleep that night independent of my brain God by his mercy and by his spirit put his truth in my heart and i woke up
30:30 -  that next morning with the most wonderful peace and calm that i've ever enjoyed in 35 years i came to a breakfast table and i said to this jewish woman no i believe i understand
30:39 -  and that woman rolled right off of her seat onto the floor and she was there on her knees with her hands above her head she was rolling down her face because a prayer that night was lord we've done everything with a stubborn
30:49 -  man you make him understand God showed me that you'd take me by the hand as a child for 14 months and led me step by step in a wrestling match to this growing realization
31:01 -  of who Jesus is who had spoken to me out of this book and out of the faces and the lives of those gentile believers who were picking up off the center of the world and now it was put up or shut up wrestle to the end or walk away and
31:14 -  never be able to say that i'm a man of integrity who loves truth or let alone that i'm a jew however many unanswered questions there were still were there was one question about which there was no power
31:24 -  Jesus is who he said he is that same woman at the well said well when the mashiach comes she said when the messiah comes he'll teach us all things verily verily Jesus said unto her he says unto you
31:35 -  i who speak unto thee and me Jesus touched the eyes of a blind man and he was made whole and he saw and they dragged him to the synagogue and they interrogated him who was this
31:46 -  who gave you sight and he said well if you're asking me you know i i don't know too much about this man named Jesus always a man see and they cast him out and discussed and Jesus found him in the
31:56 -  street and they had a chat and Jesus spoke to him about the lord and this jewish man said who is he that i might worship him Jesus said he was stupid unto thee and look guys let's get with us are we
32:09 -  students or aren't we students do we value the written word or don't we value it God has called us to a wrestling match tonight from which we cannot turn he's not called us to indifference but
