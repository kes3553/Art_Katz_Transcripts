The Mercy of Conversion

00:00 -  they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake they have been historically into this present moment when the magnitude of that opposition breaks upon the nation's soul that in opposing what they thought was
00:12 -  contrary to God they were opposing God himself and actually being an agent of persecution and even producing alternate messianic schemes and that comes with a revelation of the
00:24 -  lord when they shall see his wounds we shall see him whom we have pierced and mourn for him that explains why our conversion is not as radical
00:35 -  our calling is not as profound our sin was not as grievous so i don't want to make that a rule but i would say that that should be factored in that both the enormity of Paul's sin in Israel's
00:50 -  and also the magnitude of their calling required the radicalness of the revelation of the lord and the depth of their conversion you know that we published a booklet called apostolic conversion
01:03 -  centered on Paul's experience and some a pastor who had read it said well that's fine for Paul but i have not seen that kind of revelation that light has not come to me so how can we how can one be expected to
01:19 -  have a have a conversion as profound as deep i said well now that you have read the booklet that light has come so you mean the the challenge of that word
01:32 -  is for that reader a measure of that light so i think it's something that Paul's saying about that we have the seed of it but we need a more profound appropriation of it Paul got it
01:43 -  in one fell swoop it blinded him and he was and he remained it remained blind and would have died blind if God not had sent an ananias to lay hands on him to receive his sight and for three
01:56 -  days he neither ate nor drank that is to say he was as a dead man the depth of that revelation no man shall see God and live almost became literally true in the life of Paul
02:09 -  so that God had to raise him from a death of repentance to become the great apostle and his proclamation of the gospel had such a power on those who heard it
02:24 -  that they were turned from idols to serve the living God and maybe what it's waiting for is a church that has appropriated to some measure the radicalness of Paul's conversion
02:35 -  that they might proclaim the gospel of that conversion with an appropriate intensity we're saved but not converted i often say so many say a few converted
02:47 -  it's a good question but because the circumstances of our coming to God were not as Paul's does not mean they were condemned forever to a shallowness of faith one of the mercies of God is that what Paul
02:59 -  got in one fell swoop the lord piecemeal gives us gives it to us in proportion so 30 years later i have a greater apprehension now of sin than the day in which i was saved
03:13 -  i'm repenting now inwardly and brokenly and continually in a way that was not possible for me 30 years ago and it's a mercy that God gives it to me over the span of time
03:24 -  or you would be extinguished we can be envious of Paul but also fearful so just to conclude and sum up the magnitude of the sin and the magnitude of this calling i
03:38 -  think are related to the magnitude of the revelation which came to him that brought the depth of that conversion some thoughts on the nature of conversion
03:50 -  maybe what's wanting is that we need to see ourselves as murderers where we in fact have a nice middle-class kids who have kept our noses clean potentially the capacity for murder and
04:04 -  atrocity is always with us the fact that we have not performed it is merely a providential grace that it was never required but if it were a what hideous crime and sin
04:19 -  and enormity would we fall short the best of us and isn't that why germany had to be the the promulgators of the holocaust in all of their self-celebration as the land of girder schiller
04:34 -  art culture philosophy refinements civilization they became bestial in the annihilation of the jew and we who have condemned them as germans
04:48 -  the german sin and we won't put a foot in the volkswagen are now ourselves moving closer and closer to the revelation of the same thing as jews
05:00 -  toward arabs so it's a mercy of God to go that far to arrange the re-creation of the state politically and put us in a position of power that if for no other reason
05:14 -  that we can walk out and enact the revelation of our sin that would never have come to us if we had remained in ghetto seclusion living in our fanciful imagining about ourselves as being virtuous
05:28 -  he's put us in the place of power threatened where our very existence is threatened that requires us to act in such a way so as to say finally that we're no better than any
05:41 -  and they were capable of the horror and the atrocity that was inflicted upon us we are now inflicting upon others truly there's no man good no not one that's all the preliminary
05:51 -  to Israel's final conversion how far will God go and the only thing that justifies it is the issue of eternity that to save us from the fire that shall not be quenched
06:07 -  it's not extravagant to go all this way even to the establishment of the state and the whole drama of Israel with this final revelation revelation well God didn't think the good
06:19 -  God did not think it too extravagant to give steven's life for Paul a man who's who was radiant and whose face shone like an angel and who miracles and demonstrations of power flowed from him
06:33 -  and yet he was made a sacrifice brutally beaten stone to death clothing laid at Paul's feet soul's feet that he would be goaded by the demonstration of the magnanimity of that man's death
06:46 -  in martyrdom what isn't that a beautiful picture how far and God says i've given men for you i've given ethiopians and and maybe he'll give the church for them maybe we will suffer
06:58 -  a martyrdom even at their hands in order to demonstrate the magnanimity of God his forbearance his love and forgiveness that will not produce an immediate repentance but when they will see the
07:12 -  lord boom it all comes together how shall we understand the zachariah 13 every family apart and every husband apart that the depth of their
07:26 -  the pang of their repentance is so profound they can't even bear to be in each other's presence each one has got to go apart and cry out before God personally that's more than just the
07:38 -  revelation of the lord that's the revelation of the lord plus a whole history of witness that had been all along rejected and comes to bear in a single moment when the lord comes
07:51 -  the gasp of recognition of all that had been spoken to you which you have not only rejected but killed and stoned those who have brought it to you now is seen comes to light in the
08:03 -  revelation of him when you see his wounds i tell you what i would rather see a jew save now than to wait for that moment and accept that God had poured out
08:17 -  the gift of the spirit of grace and of supplications they would have perished in their very repentance it would have killed them they would their bodies would have been so wracked by the anguish of soul of
08:29 -  repentance that it might well have snuffed out their lives it's a mercy to be saved now and before the revel that kind of last moment's revelation
08:42 -  so this is a a great subject and if this was in our hearts i think that we would be spurred now to a much more intense witness to that nation to that people
08:55 -  to save them from the horror of that final revelation though praise God it will come just to throw out a question maybe to dwell on it then maybe we could take it up after the break
09:06 -  why has God himself chosen the demonstration of his mercy as the ultimate demonstration of himself and of his glory of all of his attributes why does he himself select mercy
09:20 -  what is there about mercy that is so revealing in God's own sight of himself when moses asked to see his glory God showed him his mercy
09:32 -  but what is it about the nature of mercy and i think it's important for us to understand it because a great measure of that demonstration will be required to come through us
09:42 -  that by our mercy they may receive mercy is a final enactment of God's mercy toward Israel through the church but if we don't fully understand what it is
09:55 -  what is it that is to demonstrate that they may obtain what is mercy that God himself has chosen it as the ultimate expression and demonstration of himself
10:07 -  and calls it his glory i'm trying to seek for a definition how would we define the word loving kindness is there a difference between kindness and loving kindness
10:24 -  usually extended if not invariably to those who are totally undeserving in other words if it's deserved is it still mercy you know that mercy by definition is a kindness
10:38 -  of love extended to those who don't qualify for it it's not a payment for virtue or services rendered it's something of God by his nature that is given
10:50 -  independent of the condition of those upon whom it is bestowed it's bestowed because of God not because of the virtue of those or the lack of virtue of those who receive it maybe all the more
11:07 -  the lack so i i referred to that scripture romans 11 that by your mercy they may obtain mercy what mercy do we have God is implying that we have a mercy that we can
11:23 -  dispel in fact that historically it's critical that this bestowing be made in the last days through the church to Israel that will be absolutely bereft of anything
11:36 -  and just hanging on the ropes ready to sink into death and oblivion unless a mercy comes but it's not an abstract mercy it's the mercy that the church itself bestows because it has
11:48 -  obtained mercy how would give you come on you guys what mercy have we obtained that is a palpable something that we are able then to transmit convey or media or minister
12:07 -  you think my in life that there's a consciousness in the church that they have received mercy so you think it's fair to say that more mercy has been bestowed upon us than we are aware of definitely even
12:20 -  adverse that no mercies are new every morning who's conscious this morning of many mercy that has composed yet his word says every day nothing lends itself to be more
12:32 -  transfiguring the holiest things of God the greatest demonstrations of God namely the mercy of God depicted of Jesus on the cross lends itself to being religionized that there's something uncanny that the
12:48 -  deepest revelation of God has the potential to be transfigured into something less than other sentimentalized distorted misunderstood misused misrepresented
13:06 -  i i don't know how to understand that but are you understanding what i'm saying i think the one word that for the want of one single word that would describe that phenomenon i would call it religious or religion religion is the
13:22 -  propensity of men to take the holiest things of God in all of their one meaning intention and so to transfigure them as to rob them of their cogency and power how many of us even as the most sincere
13:36 -  believers have been really smitten with the awareness of the mercy of God that is revealed at calvary i have to confess that i'm i'm not in the foremost strengths of those that
13:49 -  have been smitten i want to be i know i need to be but for some reason i have not been i don't know what's wanting but we need a fresh deep appropriation or apprehension of the cross
14:03 -  or we will have scant mercy to give when i preached this one day in a church a woman just cried out spontaneously out of the congregation she said how can you expect us to
14:16 -  manifest mercy to Israel we don't even have it for ourselves right in the right within our own congregation there's a wanting of mercy within the people of God
14:28 -  so that the mercy has been poured out if it's not recognized not understood not deeply appropriated will not be able to demonstrate it so something needs to break on our deepest consciousness
14:43 -  and i think i can safely say that that is not the least of the prophetic task in the work of restoration is to take the things that have been cheapened made commonplace turned into religion
14:59 -  artifacts things hanging on walls around necks whose meaning has been lost and to restore the original meaning that God himself intended
15:09 -  i would say that this is probably one of the most if not the most critical area of need if the church is to fulfill its mandate toward Israel that by our mercy they may receive
15:21 -  mercy something has got to happen to move us from mere creedal acknowledgement that we have received mercy to an existential appropriation
15:32 -  so real so vibrant that we can extend it see this is a last day's requirement to put up or shut up and a measure of whether we have moved from mere nominal religiosity and exceeding to the truths of the
15:49 -  faith in a way that would be acceptable in any church situation to such a radical prophetic and apostolic appropriation that we can actually manifest it
16:00 -  and if that manifestation does not come this people will in fact actually perish it's going it's going to be a life and death question in other words what i'm saying is and i've said it many times
16:12 -  mere religious obligation will not enable us to be to a distressed Israel what their last hours predicament will require it's going to take more than just mere
16:25 -  civility or what can you call it the polite you know response it's going to take mercy and how many i'm like asking the same question in another form
16:39 -  how many Christians are actually conscious of the mercy they've received we can say how many Christians are actually conscious that they've been grafted into the root of another people that we who were
16:50 -  without God and without hope and were far off have been brought nigh by the blood of the messiah into the spiritual commonwealth of Israel now if it cost God something to pour out
17:02 -  his mercy namely the death of the sun in the most excruciating agony what will it cost us to put it another way is mercy still mercy if it comes without cost
17:20 -  religious politeness we can perform but mercy the bowels of mercy that they might obtain mercy when at their ultimate crisis point despised and hated among all nations
17:36 -  when to be a quarry ten boom to them and to take them in and to extend mercy means to to sign your death warrant it means to put your head on the block because you'll you're identifying with that people and you're going to be
17:50 -  subjected to the same persecution and penalty maybe even more outraged i don't have many dreams but one dream i had of being yanked out of bed by men who pounded the door at like three or four
18:03 -  in the morning like like gestapo jack-booted hooligans and being yanked out you weren't even allowed to get dressed and thrown into the back of a car i don't know it's my vision or another
18:14 -  that related this to me but on the words the description of it is anchored and the question was asked as they were bundled up in front of the back of car and driven out in the middle of the night shit they'd
18:24 -  cried out why are you doing this to us and the answer was you are among those who are helping the jews there might be a greater fury directed against gentiles helping the jews and against the jews themselves
18:40 -  so i don't think i'm overstating something but that we need to recognize that the mercy that God will require which will be a life and death provision will come at cost it was so for God
18:53 -  and it must be so for us and indeed if it does not come at cost how will those who receive it recognize it as mercy these are great questions
19:06 -  so it behooves us even to attempt to define that word and i think we're getting at it we're feeling for it not the least of things that were included is that now by virtue of my death by obedience on the suffering at
19:19 -  the cross is released that which is set in motion that will eventuate in Israel's final and ultimate deliverance because i'm raising up the people who receive my mercy
19:30 -  through this death that will then be able to extend it to them it's all together connected in peace it's the final consummation of what was established initially at the cross and when that breaks on the
19:43 -  consciousness of jews in their distress to recognize that what is being expressed toward them is not some sentimental or human temperamental thing peculiar to the personality of the one who has taken
19:56 -  them in but they're going to find it in minnesota you'll find it in kansas they'll find it in arizona they'll find it in mexico they'll find it in canada wherever they are they've been moving
20:06 -  the consistent mercy from place to place will finally have to bring them to this question what i'm seeing is more than just the temperament or the personality of a single
20:16 -  individual i'm seeing a consistency of a nature that seems to be in all those to whom we're being brought and they're all goyim they're all gentiles how can i understand this what gives them
20:29 -  this same character and nature but the fact that something was released in that initial sacrifice that makes this sacrifice possible in other words this revelation will draw them to that revelation
20:42 -  and that indeed is the ultimate mercy so that the redeemed of the lord shall return to zion they didn't begin their journey as redeemed but in the course of it
20:54 -  they've passed from unbelief to the faith of the revelation of the son of God in the face of God's people see what i mean yeah that's that's the great thing that that is subsumed in that
21:08 -  statement it is finished well i've quoted ezekiel 20 i will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations face to face quoted romans 11 that by your mercy may obtain mercy
21:22 -  but what brings the scripture in romans at the conjunction with the scripture ezekiel my prophetic sense of the connectedness you know it's fantastic it's
21:35 -  phenomenal the mercies of God and to break on our consciousness first that we might in turn be the voice by which could be break on the consciousness of those
21:46 -  who are totally unsuspecting and in a different way would you say that the present conduct of Israel toward its palestinian population uh suggests the knowledge of mercy
21:59 -  yes talk about questions that answer themselves they are just as ruthless and as methodical and violent and and inconsiderate as anyone has ever been to to them
22:12 -  to us they're bereft of mercy because they've never obtained mercy you have no capacity to extend it to your first obtained it the same thing is true of forgiveness that's why they're unforgiving to the
22:25 -  germans my mother to this day until we recognize to what degree we have received mercy and that in God's sight our atrocities whether or not we have actually performed
22:36 -  performed them identifies us with the grossest sins that mankind has ever performed so to communicate that is another seeing
22:51 -  so you need first to see it and then you need to proclaim it or to make it known and that very thing defines what profit is
23:04 -  we can be enriched by the teacher and be brought into an investigation but in the last analysis when that word will come to a desperate and final people and even to the church
23:15 -  today in its sleep has got to come to a prophetically then they can have teaching but they need first to be wakened stabbed awake so to speak by a penetrating word
23:28 -  but here's the thing can we speak it persuasively penetratingly if we ourselves are not the conscious recipients of it that's the not the prophet therefore must be the thing in itself
23:46 -  he himself is the word made flesh it's integral to his whole life his circumstances condition his testings and his trials he is not allowed to know mercy academically or theologically
23:59 -  or exegetically he's got to know it by having his face rubbed in the dirt being dragged through circumstances knocked from pillar to post till he knows that he knows that he knows then his word is not only credible but
24:11 -  penetrating and that's what distinguishes that proclamation from teaching or other ministries of the word everything brings us back to the cross and i think to the degree that satan
24:27 -  knows that he would do everything in his power to nullify the meaning of the cross by cheapening it by sentimentalizing it in our internet when i went to germany with a message
24:38 -  for germany i said you are the victims of the influence of the poet goethe who was horrified by the brutality of the cross it offended his liberal artistic temperament
24:53 -  and he said we need to garland the road the cross with roses take the sting out of it because that was his humane or humanistic disposition which in fact took place
25:08 -  and maybe more than we realize it has taken place with us and that something has happened to cheetahs and robbers of the brutality of the cross i mean the the horror and if you've read ben Israel you know
25:22 -  that my experience when i met a german artist on the road is a jewish sheikah who said art you must not miss this you have to go out of your way to see this famous painting
25:33 -  of christ crucified the isenheim altar what's the other group involved that's the name of the artist the 15th 16th century masterpiece so that well i've seen a lot of pictures of Jesus crucified and it looks like a
25:45 -  ballet dancer with a piece of cloth nicely wrapped around even sensual in the way his body is depicted when i stood before that painting in that day my
25:57 -  God i was done and i had to avert my face the the horror the way in which that body was depicted was i looking at a man or some grotesque caricature of a man more more animal than
26:11 -  men so brutalized and the fresh gangrenous green you and splinters and pieces are from the flagellation sticking in his in his flesh and his mouth agape and drool of death out of the corners of his
26:23 -  mouth and this poor stripping broken hulk of humanity that was another depiction and i'm saying that we need to get back to that and that's the prophetic task and
26:35 -  we're going to have to fight for that we have to contend for that faith it's not going to come easily and if we ourselves are satisfied with mere creedal affirmations of the truth of that
26:49 -  faith and have not pressed in and wrestled to get the existential power of it we will not be able to communicate it to anyone we will allow the church to remain in
27:03 -  its passivity giving condescension to the truth of something but never having been profoundly affected by it to be broken and to be emptied seeing his emptiness
27:13 -  that we might be the vessels of mercy in our generation this is the prophetic task and can you understand my insane jealousy when i hear that word bandied about
27:24 -  by men who don't even begin to perceive this let alone perform it and i'm being flattered and honored everywhere is the man of the hour the great oracle they're running by the thousands to hear and maybe he's got a
27:35 -  word from me and and maybe what we're what we're seeing in this crop of prophets is the testimony of a failed christianity that has not pressed in has not wrestled
27:47 -  has been satisfied with mere creedal affirmation sufficient for us to get by but insufficient for his glory only one who is jealously driven by the concern for God's glory will
28:02 -  welcome the pain of this kind of appropriation of the faith this is suffering and that the fate of a whole people waits on it
28:19 -  wow it's a payoff the whole destiny of a nation and more than that the destiny of all nations by the restoration of that nation talk about the faith of God
28:32 -  and then that the whole thing rests with a prophetic core that will be to the church what it must first be that it might ultimately be to Israel what it might be
28:43 -  that Israel then might itself be the vehicle of God's mercy to the nations what what a bunch of dominoes it begins with this first one here which is us
28:57 -  isn't it interesting how discreet God is in showing what goes into the makings of the prophet we see them come almost full blown on the stage of history and great enactments and confrontations
29:10 -  with false prophets and apostate nation or we we catch the glimpse of their initial call but the preparation is not depicted for us it's like a discreet shade drawn
29:24 -  but you can imagine what has gone on behind that shade i just so want to drive this steak into your hearts the existential appropriation of the faith
29:37 -  that's that's the issue everything rests on that what does that take one thing we can say it will never be obtained at sunday services you can multiply them a million times
29:52 -  over God bless the lord for the the provision of them but something more than successions of services will be required but what is that something more i was talking to david the other day about
30:04 -  our children both wrestling as fathers with the same issue not wanting to see our kids brainwashed into the faith so easy to do to run them through the course and they learn the phrases and
30:14 -  they pick it up they're so imitative and they know how to say the right things and but they get out into the world and bang they collapse like the proverbial deck of cards they have not
30:24 -  really a sufficient faith in themselves so what do you do do you abstain from from uh brainwashing what's the other word for that like a cat programming programming indoctrinating indoctrinating
30:37 -  and let them struggle and and go through their own trials and and see that the gravity of their own souls and come to the place where they come up jackley on their face before God and cry out for his so great
30:49 -  salvation are we willing to take the risks of that they might get pregnant in the meantime or go to jail or who knows what it's a real tension raise up the
31:02 -  children in a way that they should go when they become adult that's not depart from it these these paradoxes we realize that the same question that we're raising about fathers with
31:13 -  children is the question that we can raise about fathers and the church a matter of responsibility in the church do we baby the congregation do we safeguard and protect them
31:26 -  from the threat of a word that will leave them rattled and disquieted after all they're young in the faith yet you don't dare take the risk they might get unglued my greatest problem is with pastors
31:40 -  who by the very nature of their call are protective toward the congregation and want to keep them from the threat that might come in an ungainly word out of a character of this kind
31:52 -  isn't that a paradox that a man acting in the very character of his office and another acting in the character of his office are in a point of collision out of the very logic of their callings and yet there's the congregation
32:07 -  hanging in the balance needing this kind of thrust and challenge and not able to get it because they've been protected so right in the church we have the same kind of issue
32:24 -  well i've typed up a something i didn't know what i was going to bring it maybe this is the point to introduce it distinctive aspects of the prophetic ministry and calling taking notes
32:37 -  maybe the last question the last examination is define the heart and the essence of the prophetic calling what are its distinctive characteristics
32:49 -  i've already mentioned several even as we've been talking small this passion for the jealousy this jealous passion for the glory of God i would almost say an insane passion enough to make you a fool for christ's
33:06 -  sake that if that pastor does by some dint of God and the grace of God allow you to speak that when you speak you'll be utterly obedient to God knowing
33:17 -  that this pastor will regret that they ever came that he allowed you to stand up to that platform so only a divine jealousy for God's glory will enable you to be his fool
33:32 -  and the prophet is ultimately God's fool we've already mentioned the prophet is the thing in himself and guys don't look at me as the finished product like i wish i could say
33:47 -  uh come and see you know i mean i'm in process but i know enough to say to say that what i'm sharing is true and i'm not yet formed in it but i desire to be and will be
34:00 -  remember we said we cannot call the people to mercy unless mercy is so integral to our own being it's in our deepest heart of consciousness out of the very dealings
34:10 -  of God that makes our word not only credible but penetrating the fact of the matter is it makes our word an event an event has got to come to the
34:20 -  church the event of the cross remember what i was prompted to share with you at the end of the prayer time i said i don't know why i'm saying this but all of a sudden the lord has just
34:31 -  dropped this into my memory of the event in chicago after that open debate with these uh student rebels who had closed down the campus to come that night or the next day to this assemblies of God church and
34:43 -  and on the platform looking out at these well-dressed middle-class kids many of whom were without bibles would come from a good time and the lord whispered speak on the cross
34:54 -  as well as i could in obedience i spoke and boom down they went the bodies were proliferated everywhere in the aisle under steps over the altar so
35:06 -  the prophet is the thing in himself he has got to be or his message will lack that penetration that can produce that event the church needs an event a word that constitutes event
35:22 -  and that has got to come out of the the anvil with the give me a word the matrix the uh the gut of the man who himself has was been by God's mercy brought through the reality of
35:37 -  that thing it's almost like his own crucifixion to appropriate christ you need such an identification with that suffering which cannot be yours just by looking at the painting there's a measure in which
35:51 -  you have to get in the frame and to know something of what uh that feels like i was a recruited layman high school teacher who just uh and agonized over this decision to leave
36:07 -  the teaching profession being a depression baby and now enjoying the security of tenure and annual age of wage increments and health insurance and retirement i there was nothing i wrestled with more in my
36:18 -  young believing life than than the invitation to become a missionary to the Jews i was already i was saved at the age of 35 i was already 38 hardly a time for a man to start beginning to
36:29 -  get school but they had a training program and the lord supernaturally after much agonizing showed that this was his will we left our little seven eleven thousand seven hundred dollar house in oakland
36:39 -  california the last time i saw it was being sold for sixty something thousand a one bedroom house but it was ours we ingrenoid began in a one-room apartment with the bed coming out of the
36:50 -  wall so to leave and make a decision like that was fearful but i had no thought that i was ever to be a preacher i was willing to be trained to represent
37:01 -  the mission and make mission presentations christ in the Passover and present the missions program to churches for support i'd give my testimony maybe but a preacher what presumption
37:14 -  the lord himself had to give me the business pushing me from behind more and more but the thing about prophetic i'll tell you how that came after i've been cast
37:26 -  out of Israel as believers and returning to the states after many trials of my fire where i gave a message in washington dc on munich for christ's sake and was virtually run out of the
37:36 -  country and the lord let me simmer in the pain of having brought such a stabbing confrontation and outcry from people and that i had really missed it
37:51 -  we came back from Israel and went to california to get another brother's furniture and somehow in the course of that trip and the coming back and the beginning of speaking first messages
38:02 -  i think it was that very brother Paul borden who said to me don't you know art that you're you have the call of a prophet i think i was driving the u-haul trying i looked at what
38:14 -  i had no notion at all i had no idea at all then the next was urn baxter at whose church i spoke on the patriarchs abraham and jacob and i forgot who else and he introduced me
38:28 -  and spoke of them as prophetic presentations what i was by and so it was by this means usually coming from others that awareness was growing that
38:39 -  indeed and then my own life and my own history my trials my tribulations the kind of word that i was bringing the effect of that word just like the chicago thing made me to realize that it was not teaching
38:52 -  it was something else and so that was the process i never had a distinct call of the kind that we read about so the prophet is the thing in himself and it's not an instant thing
39:04 -  you know this is the instant generation give me a key bag or a frozen dinner and put it in the and they're watching the call that then we'll have it in in one and a half minutes if the
39:15 -  prophet is the thing in himself it's a lifetime's making and maybe it's all preparation for one episode the elijah's confrontation for example with the prophets of bail one or two
39:27 -  start dramatic things and many's removed and it would not be a lavish investment in God to prepare a home a man's whole life frustration disappointment rejection whatever it is
39:38 -  for one final moment of use but if that moment is not fulfilled in the intention of God the whole of his wisdom and determination can be offset or lost it's a critical moment
39:54 -  and once and for all moment eternal in its ramifications so therefore it's not lavish to say that it requires a whole lifetime's preparation think of our mentality today three
40:05 -  months course and you're ready to go off for God youth with a mission i mean God bless youth but we're talking now about a little something else
40:16 -  and we need to have an appreciation for this and not an appreciation that will allow the prophet to be formed in our own congregations whose growth is very painful and
40:30 -  annoying and nettlesome he's a he's a pain and a mixed bag and he says this and that and some of it is of God and some it's of the flesh and he's always finding
40:41 -  something to seize upon and he interrupts the service and you never know how he's going to sound off he's unpredictable and part of the maturity of the church is its ability to provide an
40:54 -  environment of love that is conducive to the bringing forth of such a one in its midst i mean where where will his first speaking take place is God going to set him before
41:07 -  men and nations abruptly and immediately he'll start him off in your own congregation and you'll have to suffer him so here again we're brought back to ecclesiology
41:19 -  the church and how little comprehension there is in the church about this the ability to recognize those who already have evidence of the cold and not only to dampen them but rather
41:32 -  to encourage them and yet at the same time to clip their wings and to show them the admixture of flesh and spirit and by such a process of gentle and loving admonition and exhortation
41:45 -  to help them to the coming forth of the time when their word will go not only to the church but beyond it separate unto me Paul and bonibus for the work went to i've called them will be the word of God
41:56 -  that again comes when there are men who are separated even from the consciousness of their own calling let alone any subtlety of ambition that needs for them to be seen applauded recognized
42:09 -  where they can bear the rejection reproach of what will invariably be the consequence of the ministry that that process takes place in the church
42:22 -  so the prophet is a thing himself his own life and history in God is calculated to that end the biography of prophets is not a guy with a little house with a white picket fence and a sweet little
42:36 -  wife with an apron on and the cuters all get out in it and they live happily ever after it's chagrin and aggravation and consternation and and every kind of thing you can think of
42:50 -  because that's how this thing is formed there's no cheap way to incubate it he has got to pass through the essence of the issues in order one day to address them
43:01 -  with penetration and authority the message dovetails with his own life experience and often arises out of his past the prophet has a history in God
43:19 -  who are you guys have ever heard me use that phrase do you have a history in God it's interesting that the overcomers of the last days are those who overcome by the blood of
43:27 -  the lamb and the word of their testimony and love not the life of the dead the word of their testimony is another way to describe a believer's history in God
43:41 -  the crises for which he has passed the crises of faith where he's been stretched to the breaking we could not believe that God could bring him through this i've gone through some of these things
43:52 -  right while the school has been in session and then to see the faithfulness of God and come in the morning completely zero out of it dull uninspired wanting to run the other
44:08 -  way and just seeing the grace of God begin to operate even in the prayer time and the encouragement that comes by the moving of his spirit and look at today
44:19 -  it's not even part of my intention thinking that Paul would take the entire morning and just to see the undead this strengthens my faith to see the sovereignty and working of God on the
44:32 -  spot so there's got to be a history of that you need to become conscious of your history to become conscious of your history in God is to become conscious of history period
44:45 -  and the prophet needs to have a sense of the past because he sees more than others the continuing influences that issue from the past and profoundly affect the present
44:59 -  and the ultimate future he sees the continuum the unbroken span of past present and future as few see it most believers themselves are locked in the present moment
45:13 -  a people without a history is a people without an identity but look at the privilege that we have that we should have an identity coexist my God with the past that we have we're
45:28 -  related to abraham isaac and jacob and moses and and Paul and the prophets and we have a millennial destiny and future that makes for an extraordinary security and assurance in the present
45:43 -  we know who we are in God we have a history and we have a sublime future therefore whatever the the issues of the immediate future however uncertain
45:52 -  we can bear them and we can encourage others to bear them and communicate our sense both of the things that were passed in the things future as being integral related and in an
46:04 -  unbroken continuum this is the distinctive privilege of the church and it lacks it this is seeing the prophets view the way he sees and his ability to communicate it as vision
46:18 -  without a vision the people perish and if it doesn't come from the prophetic man it does not come so he has a an awareness of the past a profound concern for the future and a heavy sense of the
46:32 -  coming destiny he sees the sweep and the purpose of God the larger picture he's not one for the nuts and bolts for the for the details and how do you do this and that
46:46 -  he sees the arching overview and that's what the church needs to see that's the framework of its life every time i come to the word see we need to underline that he sees he sees
47:01 -  he sees other if you don't have that then you just fixed in that moment think of churches and their programs so narrow so petty so why because they cannot see what they're doing and what
47:13 -  they are about in this moment in the context of something much larger of which they are in connection and movement towards some end because they've not seen the beginning in the past
47:25 -  they lack the prophetic view and therefore they're all put up in the immediate program which very likely has been birthed out of their flesh or out of a necessity to do something
47:38 -  and is not constantly in the continuum of things apostolic and prophetic in fact you have no more apprehension of the future than you have of the past your ability to perceive the things that are yet
47:51 -  future is all together relative to your appropriation of the things past and do you think you're going to have that for the overarching things of God that
48:02 -  pertain to his purpose and glory and lack it for your own life are you going to be a dumb dumb about your personal past and not understand and sift through that and the dealings of God in your own life
48:15 -  and somehow have a majestic view of God's overarching purposes no way the two things are related if you're going to be one who turns aside to see the burning bush
48:26 -  as it pertains to God's purpose for Israel you have already turned aside to see the the flaming issues of your own life and have not passed them by oh if you guys got that last statement
48:39 -  you can go home now you got your money's worth already just that one statement and i'll repeat it lest you missed it you'll not turn aside to see the burning bush of God
48:57 -  in which the lord himself is in the midst in a revelation of himself that waits on that moment of a particular kind and ascending into apostolic service if you have not already turned aside to see
49:12 -  the burning bushes of this of the issues of your own life most of us look away and our past is the wreckage of failed marriages divorces failed relationships failed church situations
49:28 -  but we go on to something else and sleep and sweep the past under the proverbial rug and have not turned aside to see it's painful that's why people don't turn aside
49:41 -  and we look to the new situation to remove the memory of the past that's the human propensity it's a propensity that the prophet cannot indulge he has got to have the
49:53 -  guts to face up to his own past and his own failures in fact those failures have very likely been given him by God to fit him to to not miss the burning bush when it
50:06 -  comes in the moment of his final calling this turning aside to see remember we said about it that even the rabbis say that this was the great moment that God waited for it if moses
50:18 -  would turn aside because there's no assurance having turned aside you'll ever turn back again to where you were all that you trusted in all that you understood all that you understood by
50:29 -  the faith your charismatic understanding may go up in a puff you'll never come back to it again you cannot you've seen something new a prophet is ruthless he'll bring a word of destruction
50:45 -  if he has to in fact invariably he has to before he can bring the word of building and planting remember what God said to jeremiah root up pluck out destroy tear down that's the first requirement on
50:59 -  then you build and plant especially the prophet of restoration the elijah must first come and i want to ask you has he yet come do you expect an elijah Jesus says we have to
51:12 -  before his return and in what manner and form do you expect that that coming will be corporate corporate an elijah company of people who have the elijah call who are ruthless
51:28 -  in what they must root out and pluck up and tear down and would you say you call that mercy talk about mercy would have been mercy to make nice and to honor the
51:40 -  treasured traditions and how dear they are to people
