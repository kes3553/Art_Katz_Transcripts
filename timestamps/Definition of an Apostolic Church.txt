Definition of an Apostolic Church

00:00 -  Holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, while you're yet in the earth, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession. Consider what is apostolic and what is priestly,
00:25 -  and bring that into your deepest consideration, for the church that is not apostolic and not priestly forfeits any part in God's end-time purpose.
00:46 -  So the great word that we need to understand, to apprehend and to apprehend it by, is the word apostolic or apostle.
01:04 -  And these two great words, apostle and prophet, are under the severest attack now, not directly, but subtly,
01:22 -  by men who presume to use these titles, whom God has never sent, who have no priestly distinction nor understanding,
01:38 -  and are not ashamed to call themselves and be called by these great titles. So we need to be jealous for the great words. If we lose these words and their meaning,
01:56 -  we lose the whole genius of the church. So may the word find lodging in your heart. Apostle, prophet.
02:14 -  We have a black lady living behind my house in Minnesota, because 14 years ago I spoke in Mobile, Alabama, and when I spoke the word apostle or apostolic,
02:37 -  she said the word went directly into my heart. I didn't know what it meant, but I knew one day I would be with this man over that subject,
02:54 -  and she is with this man, my age, 75, 76, living in the arctic region of North America, Minnesota, going on for her ninth year,
03:21 -  because she heard one word. But what a word. Lord, great high priest and apostle of our confession,
03:37 -  can anyone be more jealous over this word than you? You are the very personification of it. And the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
03:55 -  You subsume in yourself these two great titles. So impart to us an understanding. And send the word into our heart as you did into that black lady.
04:12 -  And we will be so jealous for its meaning. So watchful over these words, that we will be able to discern those who say they are apostles and are not,
04:33 -  and equally recognize the sent ones who come to us, who indeed are sent. So we thank you.
04:48 -  Grant us grace, Lord, and this concluding word, that of all of the subjects that could yet be touched,
04:59 -  you have appointed this as the final omega word of these days. So speak again. Your servants are hearing.
05:12 -  We thank and give you praise in Jesus' name. Now you'll be surprised to learn where we're going to begin. The book of Exodus, chapter 25.
05:29 -  You say, how could that possibly have anything to do with the New Testament word of Russell? And the answer is everything. In chapter 25 of Exodus,
05:50 -  God gives Moses, who himself is an essential apostle, because God said to him out of the burning bush,
06:06 -  I have heard the cries of my people, I have seen their oppression, their cry has come up to me from the earth,
06:19 -  therefore I send you to confront Pharaoh, to bring my people out from Egypt,
06:29 -  and into the land of milk and honey. So in Moses we have the essential elements of the cold man,
06:45 -  that begins with a confrontation of God, in a form in which he does not show himself to many, God in the burning bush,
06:57 -  God in the fire of judgment, and he waited to see what Moses would do, would he pass by and avoid looking,
07:10 -  sensing that this is something unusual, and that it would be safe for me not to consider it. Any man who considers what is safe for him
07:26 -  is disqualified immediately, but he turned aside to see. When God saw that he turned aside,
07:42 -  and when God saw that he turned aside, he called Moses, Moses, take off your shoes,
07:53 -  for the ground upon which you stand is holy. An apostle is one who will not turn away, but look into the fire,
08:11 -  for whatever frightening thing that implies, not out of just mere curiosity, but he wanted to know why the tree burned,
08:23 -  but was not extinguished. He wants to get to the root of the matter, and understand the ultimate nature of this mystery,
08:37 -  whatever the cost to himself, because the rabbis say, on one of the rare occasions when they are right,
08:50 -  that if a man turns aside to see something as potentially terrifying as that, he can never turn back again. That one turning, that one seeing,
09:10 -  changes everything, affects all seeing and all consideration, and you're ruined for God.
09:21 -  Do you have such a heart in you? Because the apostles are the foundation of the Church. What then is the superstructure that is raised up upon it?
09:39 -  Exactly the same character as the foundation itself. So I pray that you're disposed to turn so as to see, to examine so as to understand,
09:59 -  and if you hear your name called twice, you know that this is going to be a dangerous calling. But you say, here am I,
10:14 -  on the holy ground, my shoes are off, send me. It was to this Moses, who is the father of our faith,
10:31 -  the prototype of the great apostolic figure, one who was sent, who feels disqualified,
10:43 -  who am I that I should speak for you? I'm not a man of easy speech. Moses's disqualification qualified him.
11:03 -  Because if you think you're able, and you can perform this on the basis of your competence, you're disqualified.
11:22 -  That's a contradiction. An apostle is extremely conscious of his infirmity. Who am I that you should send me?
11:38 -  And God did not argue with him. But I will be with you. That's what distinguishes an apostle
11:51 -  and an apostolic church. God will be with you because he has called you,
11:59 -  because he sends you, because beyond your own ability, he will be with you.
12:11 -  My priest and the apostle of our confession. Well, you'll have to read my book, Apostolic Foundations,
12:23 -  which has been translated into Spanish, but not yet published. And we're leaving tomorrow for Panama
12:35 -  to meet the brother who has done the translation. A convict who was saved in jail had been a drug peddler.
12:52 -  And after his conversion, he found my book in English on the website and was enormously moved by it
13:06 -  and has translated the entire book into Spanish. What a classic volume. There's an entire chapter devoted to the word eternity.
13:25 -  Apostolic character, apostolic proclamation, the principalities and powers of the air,
13:35 -  priestliness. Who knows anything about that? But Jesus is the high priest and the apostle,
13:48 -  which indicates that if you're not a priest, neither can you be an apostle. The priestliness precedes the calling.
14:01 -  Whatever this priestliness means, it needs to be discovered afresh and be incorporated into the walk
14:16 -  if we're to be an apostolic body. In Exodus chapter 25, God gives Moses the pattern on the mount,
14:35 -  how to build the tabernacle that will house God's presence and accompany Israel through its wilderness wandering
14:48 -  and come finally into the land the center of Zion. So this is more than just little quaint details.
15:05 -  The details and specifications of God are full of meaning. So you shall make an ark in verse 10 because the ark will contain the tablets of the law
15:26 -  and the word of Aaron and the pot of manna and the everlasting significance of the history of Israel.
15:42 -  So it's made out of humble wood of the kind that grows in the wilderness that is warped and twisted
15:55 -  or somehow has to be worked into a chest and be overlaid with gold and here the length is given and the depth and the height
16:10 -  In verse 11 you overlay it with pure gold inside and outside because gold is the symbol of deity of God.
16:23 -  Wood is the symbol of humanity ordinary wood but clothed with gold on the inside and the outside.
16:37 -  What a picture of a true saint whose humanity is overlaid with God not only on the outside
16:51 -  but also on the inside. Because we also are arks we also carry a treasure
17:02 -  We have this treasure in our earthly vessels not the tablets of the law the Lord give it himself
17:13 -  but the arks of God bearing a heavenly treasure which we need to live
17:22 -  and give expression and worship him. God does not despise our humanity
17:33 -  no matter how humble but he provides himself the gold of God
17:42 -  both outside and inside to uncover it. And then verse 17
17:56 -  after telling us in 16 you shall put into the ark a testimony that which I shall give you
18:04 -  and you shall make a mercy seat that's God's own terminology there's nothing here that issues from man
18:18 -  this is the pattern of God from heaven the heavenly pattern and make it of pure gold
18:28 -  two cubits and a half shall be the length and a half the breadth you shall make two cherubim of gold
18:36 -  of beaten work you shall make them in the two ends of the mercy seat one cherub on the one side
18:44 -  one on the other side and they shall make them of the two ends and these angelic things
18:53 -  shall stretch forth their wings and touch each other with their wings and their faces shall look one to another
19:07 -  toward the mercy seat shall the faces of cherubims be and you shall put this mercy seat above the ark and in the ark you shall put the testimony
19:19 -  that which I shall give you ten commandments and there I will meet with you
19:26 -  and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat and between the two cherubims
19:36 -  which upon the ark of the testimony of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel
19:44 -  I wish we had all night just to consider this because this is God's appointed place
19:56 -  not just then but now where He will meet with us in the place of mercy
20:06 -  where the two cherubim face each other formed out of the same gold formed out of the same gold
20:17 -  with their wings touching looking at each other in the face and at the same time down and through
20:28 -  they are to the testimony of the Lord of the righteous requirement of God God says there I will meet with you
20:40 -  that's where my presence will be and there only I will meet with you
20:48 -  in the place of tension and conflict between opposites male and female
21:06 -  gringo and mexican jew and gentile prophet and teacher
21:16 -  wherever there are opposites by their very nature by their very calling
21:26 -  that will always give place for tension and conflict in the place of that tension if you'll not turn away from each other
21:37 -  but look each other in the face as a jew and as a palestinian that's where I'll meet with you
21:47 -  and there I will commune with you and give you instruction and understanding I will be present there
21:56 -  above the mercy seat between the wings of the cherubim that's the place we want to run from
22:07 -  because we don't like tension we don't like conflict we would rather look the other way
22:18 -  than look into the face of that one who seems to oppose us and not oppose us in trifles but oppose us by their very nature
22:31 -  of being opposite one to the other they are opposite one to the other God knew that
22:44 -  God made that the symbolic angels on opposite ends
22:53 -  representing opposite things but compelled to look each other in the face and not turn away
23:02 -  and whatever the issues between you whatever the background and violence and misunderstanding
23:11 -  injustice and oppression look down through the mercy seat
23:20 -  where the blood of the lamb will be sprinkled and see the tablets of the Lord below I'm not asking you to take shortcuts
23:31 -  or forget the issues let bygones be bygones smooth it over
23:40 -  in the Latin way no the issues must be faced
23:49 -  or they must be faced in righteousness but they must be seen through the place of mercy and that's where I'll meet with you
23:58 -  and that's where I'll meet with you when you come to that place in priestly attitude
24:07 -  I will not shrink from it there and only there I will meet with you
24:16 -  commune with you from above the mercy seat between the cherubim and we'll give you all things
24:25 -  the commandments to the children of Israel somewhere last night or early this morning I was too tired to get up and turn the light on
24:34 -  I was too tired to get up and turn the light on I should have written it down I should have written it down
24:43 -  the phrase came to me that this place where God will meet and commune with us
24:52 -  is the nexus of apostolic authority and power is the nexus
25:01 -  of apostolic authority and power I know what I've just said is completely over your head I know what I've just said is completely over your head
25:10 -  but don't panic you'll have the tape and you'll need to hear all of this several times
25:20 -  the nexus the heart the crossroads
25:29 -  where a reality of a certain kind is to be found where a reality of a certain kind is to be found uniquely needed
25:38 -  in a troubled world on earth and in the church especially apostolic authority
25:47 -  the apostolic power the signs of the apostle is where God is
25:56 -  who himself is the high priest and the apostle of our profession and will impart to us himself
26:05 -  if we meet him in the place of opposition in the place of tension in the place of conflict
26:14 -  black and white Indian Mexican Indian
26:26 -  and Spanish descendant white aristocracy where one has been the victim of the other
26:35 -  where one has been the victim of the other over long centuries of exploitation that don't even want to look at each other
26:44 -  that don't even want to look at each other as we experienced yesterday the day before we made a trip to Salitas
26:53 -  Salito and Saltillo just to see this ancient city and its plaza
27:02 -  just to see this ancient city and its plaza under whose surface Jews who were burned at the stake are believed to be buried
27:14 -  you need to know your own history Jews have been tortured and burned alive in your Mexico
27:24 -  for being Jews by what is called Christianity by what is called Christianity
27:33 -  little wonder that they are so resistant they remember the historic past of which you yourself are ignorant
27:44 -  of which you yourself are ignorant and we walked around the plaza and two or three times we passed
27:53 -  peons the simple people of the earth the simple people of the earth
28:02 -  dark, complected obviously poor clearly uneducated
28:11 -  and they could not even lift up their eyes to look at me and they could not even lift up their eyes to look at me but enough to see the familiar complexion
28:20 -  but enough to see the familiar complexion and all that it symbolizes and to look away
28:29 -  with a hard look that has ages old in history I don't think Mexico will ever be a glory to God
28:41 -  I don't think Mexico will ever be a glory to God until there is a reconciliation of all its peoples until there is a reconciliation of all its peoples
28:50 -  in the one place that God has established in the one place that God has established where the opposites need to meet
29:00 -  and not look away but look each other in the face which some of your children are unable to do to us here
29:09 -  which some of your children are unable to do to us here they come to shake our hands but they don't look at us
29:18 -  where did they learn that? it's something instinctive but it's not kingdom
29:27 -  but it's not kingdom they should look us full in the face why are they shaking our hands?
29:36 -  for formality? to look into each other's faces is to see the face of God to look into each other's faces is to see the face of God
29:45 -  this is not just an answer for the church this is not just an answer for the church it's an answer for the world
29:54 -  for the Jews, the Israelis and the Palestinians for the Jews, the Israelis and the Palestinians violence and bloodshed and violence and torture
30:03 -  how will that ever be reconciled? how will group peace ever be reconciled? only in the place where God is
30:12 -  only in the place where God is if we look at each other face to face and see at the same time the mercy of God
30:21 -  and the righteousness of God and the righteousness of God because there he will meet with us
30:30 -  there he will give us instruction there he will give us an answer in what seems to us an irreconcilable problem
30:39 -  in the ages old brother in the ages old brother you don't get over this overnight
30:48 -  and these prejudices are deep and they exist even in the church that glosses over and doesn't want to look at it
30:57 -  where there are classes and some are not willing to look at others and that itself reflects the culture of Mexico and that itself reflects the culture of Mexico
31:06 -  and is more disposed to recognize and to esteem what is white than what is dark where they are willing to see
31:15 -  so I want to take you from this so I want to take you from this to the book of Acts
31:24 -  to the first apostolic sending to the first apostolic sending chapter 13
31:33 -  the church at Antioch the church at Antioch this is the beginning
31:43 -  not Jerusalem Antioch because the church at Jerusalem was totally Jewish
31:52 -  because the church at Jerusalem was totally Jewish but the church at Antioch was diverse in its racial
32:01 -  and cultural nature it's interesting it required this kind of a nexus
32:10 -  for an apostolic sending it required this kind of a nexus to require diversity
32:19 -  and opposites because we read in chapter 13 there were in the church at Antioch
32:28 -  not at the church, in the church not at the church, in the church certain prophets and teachers
32:38 -  and you know the difference between a prophet and a teacher? there's nothing more offensive to a teacher
32:47 -  than a prophet because the teacher is systematic because the teacher is systematic
32:56 -  he divides the word of God carefully, and only the word but a prophet
33:05 -  he's going through the wall he talks from the label on a ketchup bottle he talks from the label on a ketchup bottle
33:14 -  he has visions he's too impatient to be restricted merely to the narrow word
33:23 -  to be restricted merely to the narrow word that's the nature of his calling to be a sweeping visionary
33:33 -  but the teacher is exactly the opposite but the teacher is exactly the opposite he is suspicious about these visionaries
33:42 -  he is suspicious about these visionaries where did you get that? where does the bible say that?
33:51 -  where do you take the liberty to interpret that? I'm speaking out of experience I've had to live with this for many years
34:00 -  I've had to live with this for many years the attention the prophetic impatience with the teacher
34:09 -  can't you see? can't you see the larger thing? why is it so narrow?
34:18 -  a conflict of oppositions which God himself has created which God himself has created
34:27 -  male and female like that talk about opposites
34:36 -  talk about differences so what does God do with the Jewish prophet? so what does God do with the Jewish prophet?
34:45 -  he has him to marry a gentile from Denmark he has him to marry a gentile from Denmark Jewish prophet, the man of the tent and the altar
34:54 -  Jewish prophet, the man of the tent and the altar the visionary moving through the nations
35:03 -  with a gentile wife who wants a little white house with a picket fence who wants a little white house with a picket fence
35:12 -  and the husband that goes out at nine and comes home at five and the husband that goes out at nine and comes home at five and security
35:21 -  not the unknown where is the man? what is he doing? who embarrasses me
35:30 -  humiliates me publicly people are offended at him for the way he speaks
35:39 -  and she just wants to make nice make nice it's called the cross
35:49 -  it's called the cross both for her and for me and we want to run in opposite directions
35:58 -  and I should find a Jewish woman who is a believer and I should find a Jewish woman who is a believer with long black hair
36:07 -  Hebrew with the Hebrews my kind God says no
36:17 -  the genius of what I am about is not compatibility is not compatibility
36:26 -  or human happiness but my glory which is revealed in reconciliation
36:35 -  and those things which are opposed and those things which are opposed and those things which are opposed
36:47 -  so if you have received any benefit through me in these days bless my wife
36:56 -  it's her fault thank you Lord thank you Lord
37:05 -  so look at the details that were given here not only prophets and teachers Barnabas and Simeon was called Niger
37:14 -  Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen which had been brought up with Herod and Saul
37:23 -  which had been brought up with Herod and Saul what a bag of motley differences what a bag of motley differences
37:32 -  if a man is called Niger black is from Africa
37:41 -  and the other guy is from Cyrene a Mediterranean race and someone descended from Rome
37:50 -  and one is a gentile and the other is a Jew but when they were found worshiping the Lord together
37:59 -  the Holy Ghost said then the Holy Spirit said prepare me for the work which I have called you
38:08 -  for the work which I have called you and that's the beginning of apostolic sending and that's the beginning of apostolic sending
38:17 -  Paul was a teacher in the body the other brother was a prophet in the body but when they were sent out from the body
38:26 -  but when they were sent out from the body apostolic sending body we have the first apostles
38:35 -  we have the first apostles turned the world upside down because they went out with power
38:44 -  and authority because in the place of tension and conflict that was centuries old
38:53 -  of jealousy and opposition and fear, prejudice between Jew and gentile
39:02 -  and black and white and Roman and Hebrew they worked something through
39:11 -  that they could worship the Lord together not singing choruses from an overhead projector not singing choruses from an overhead projector
39:20 -  but the place of worship is the place of truth the place of true worship is the place of truth not the place of musicality
39:29 -  not the place of musicality they did not so much as have a single electrical appliance they did not so much as have a single electrical appliance
39:38 -  but they worshiped God but they worshiped God in spirit and truth
39:47 -  which would not have been possible if there had been an unresolved difference a secret fear
39:56 -  a secret prejudice a distrust because you're not like me
40:05 -  you're not a Jew, you're a gentile and you guys have always been opposed I don't know if I can ever trust you
40:14 -  black and white evidently Antioch was more than a church of services evidently Antioch was more than a church of services
40:23 -  see how discreet the Lord is see how discreet the Lord is he doesn't give us the details
40:32 -  he doesn't tell us how they arrived at this condition but when they arrived but when they arrived
40:41 -  it was reflected in their worship not to alongside each other but to get together
40:50 -  and then the Holy Spirit said separate from me a piece of this reality
40:59 -  I want to send this into the world where men are cutting each other's throats where men are cutting each other's throats
41:08 -  with his racial prejudice and dread and terror and misunderstanding I want to send a piece of this reality
41:17 -  that you have perfected at Antioch to bring healing and answer to the world and power
41:26 -  to bring healing and answer to the world and power and I will be with you and I will be your authority
41:35 -  and you'll turn the world upside down and you'll turn the world upside down because the world is all wrong
41:44 -  in its false systems in its phoniness, in its deceit in its makes believe
41:53 -  in its advertising in its movies, in its TV programs in its phony romance stories
42:02 -  it's a lie, lie, lie, lie and it's destroying personalities and it's destroying personalities
42:11 -  who need to be brought to reality by men who come to them in reality sent once
42:20 -  apostles who have met each other face to face who have met each other face to face
42:35 -  in Romans chapter 10 In Romans chapter 10 in Romans chapter 10
42:51 -  and Romans 9 through 11 is the heart of the Apostle Paul is the heart of the Apostle Paul
43:00 -  that deserves our most serious study is the heart of the Apostle Paul that deserves our most serious study
43:09 -  and then he takes up the mystery of Israel and the church which is so central to the church
43:18 -  which is so central to the church that the church that ignores this mystery that the church that ignores this mystery
43:27 -  that the church that ignores this mystery and that he takes away his obligation to the Jew and that he takes away his obligation to the Jew
43:36 -  loses any possibility of being apostolic the issue of being apostolic is the issue of Israel
43:45 -  rightly understood and received in chapter 10
43:54 -  talking about his Jewish people and reminding us in verse 11 and reminding us in verse 11
44:04 -  whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is rich
44:13 -  unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
44:22 -  but how shall they call on him but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
44:31 -  how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher
44:40 -  and how shall they preach except they be saved and how shall they preach except they be saved as it is written
44:49 -  how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace Lord give me grace Lord give me grace
44:59 -  don't let us sink here this is where the issue now really counts this is where the issue now really counts
45:08 -  how shall Jews call upon him how shall Jews call upon him of whom they have not really heard
45:17 -  of whom they have not really heard I lived in a Christian country for 34 years who remembered to pray
45:35 -  I'm not at liberty to tell you now but one of these rabbis the oldest
45:46 -  whom I have known for 30 years and have seen in every trip I've made to Monterrey something happened to him
45:58 -  he was able to call able to pray calling on the name of the Lord
46:07 -  because I was a sent one who could preach and bring the knowledge of him
46:16 -  and the reality that this Jewish man was able to recognize and receive
46:25 -  and receive the issue of apostolic preaching is apostolic sending because the word itself means sent one
46:52 -  because the word itself means sent one because the word itself means sent one God's intention for you
47:01 -  is that you would be the Antioch of Monterrey is that you would be the Antioch of Monterrey the Antioch of Mexico
47:10 -  the Antioch of Latin America and out of the reality that you perfect because you will not turn away your faces
47:19 -  because you will not turn away your faces because you will see issues through in righteousness, through mercy
47:28 -  through righteousness, through mercy where God will meet with you you will come to a reality
47:37 -  of a kind of true worship that when the Lord sees it this one, that one
47:46 -  that they might be sent the issue of what is truly apostolic the issue of what is truly apostolic
48:03 -  is the issue of salvation for the Jew is the issue of life or death is the issue of life or death
48:12 -  when we find men of this kind who are sent out by the Holy Ghost because after the call came at Antioch
48:21 -  because after the call came at Antioch the believers fasted and prayed and they laid their hands on Saul and Barnabas
48:30 -  and they laid their hands on Saul and Barnabas and the scripture says so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went
48:39 -  the scripture equates the laying on of the hands of ordinary men and women in the body
48:48 -  the scripture equates the laying on of the hands of ordinary men and women in the body
48:57 -  as being sent by the Holy Ghost because when you lay hands on someone because when you lay hands on someone
49:06 -  you are communicating and conferring the truth and the reality of God in your own life in whatever degree you have it
49:15 -  in whatever degree you have it that's why Paul was full of authority full of power
49:24 -  he was reflecting a corporate reality he was reflecting a corporate reality by the laying on of clean hands
49:33 -  hands that he could trust hands that he could trust because he knew these men and women
49:42 -  because they were more than Sunday Christians they were more than sitting behind somebody's head because they were in daily intensive
49:51 -  personal relationships he knew their lives, he knew their character they would test it and prove
50:00 -  they could receive their hands and not suffer loss but have an impartation
50:09 -  that he would then carry both out the Jew and Gentile and turning the world upside down and turning the world upside down
50:18 -  are your hands to be trusted? are they clean? have you diddled with the TV set?
50:27 -  have you diddled with the TV set? or scraped a coupon hoping to win a... or scraped a coupon hoping to win a...
50:36 -  or scraped a coupon hoping to win a... is your life open and clear? is your life open and clear?
50:45 -  and visible and correctable one with another and visible and correctable one with another this is what God is waiting for
50:55 -  this is what God is waiting for if you want to be ascending body for the earth is crying out
51:04 -  for the earth is crying out for true apostles who are sent in the authority of God
51:13 -  who speak the word that brings the knowledge of the name and faith by hearing
51:22 -  that creates faith where it didn't exist before that the person can call
51:31 -  for whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved not men who are self-appointed
51:40 -  not men who are self-appointed have a little following in a little religious system
51:49 -  where one sends the other and the other sends the other where it seems that a certain man has some measure of authority
51:58 -  and is impressive personally but is not himself a sent one sends himself
52:07 -  self-appointed by some prophet who prophesied that he is an apostle
52:16 -  where one confirms the other in some kind of a religious system that plays upon the great words
52:25 -  but itself is not great and threatens and opposes those things that are truly apostolic
52:34 -  are the realities that prevail today are the realities that prevail today we need to come back to the holy place
52:49 -  where God meets with us face to face so let me conclude
52:58 -  by reading you the comments on this subject by a great theologian
53:07 -  the comments on this subject by a great theologian first time in the history of the church
53:16 -  at Monterrey that a great theologian has been introduced to the general church
53:28 -  and it's about time for these men are giants they are God's gift to the church
53:37 -  and we need to receive their benefit to labor in the word and study in the original languages
53:49 -  and to probe and open the great doctrines of God is not contrary to the faith
53:58 -  nor the spirit but Pentecostals have been suspicious but Pentecostals have been suspicious
54:07 -  if something requires mind and intelligence it's considered suspicious it's considered suspicious
54:16 -  and contrary to the spirit but listen to this he raises the question
54:25 -  how shall they call upon him and confess him as Lord if they have not believed in him
54:34 -  how shall they hear without a preacher because preaching is a holy vocation it's not a profession
54:43 -  it's not a skill you learn in school the man himself is the message his character and his life
54:52 -  is caught up with his speaking is caught up with his speaking because preaching is holy
55:01 -  it's not because the man has a certain gift of gab there's no higher vocation than to preach
55:15 -  and he has to preach in such a way with such a message that it reaches and smites home to them
55:24 -  in such a way as they cannot elude or escape it there's truth and truth there's truth in a doctrinal form
55:41 -  there's truth in a doctrinal form in which we're saying the correct words and terms in which we're saying the correct words and terms
55:50 -  but it doesn't register as truth it's hollow and it's shallow it's hollow and it's shallow
55:59 -  because we have not internalized because we have not internalized we don't know its full reality and measure
56:08 -  and though we speak it technically and though we speak it technically it falls to the ground
56:17 -  it does not return to the Lord because he did not send it but the word that is sent
56:26 -  but the word that is sent through a prepared glass that has been called and sent by God
56:35 -  from a body who knows the man and laid hands upon him and sent him and continued to uphold him in prayer
56:44 -  and continued to uphold him in prayer when he goes to four countries in Africa and mainland China
56:53 -  what he speaks in those places is an event of the kind that you have been hearing and receiving
57:02 -  in these days more precious than you presently know more precious than you presently know
57:17 -  when we meet preachers like that when we meet preachers like that we cannot escape from his word
57:26 -  because it penetrates and perforates because God is with them and in them and I will meet with them
57:35 -  I will give you instructions I will be present I will be the nexus of your apostolic authority and power
57:44 -  your word will not be an entertainment your word will be a requirement because whenever God speaks
57:54 -  he does not speak to entertain he speaks to require it's a call
58:03 -  those who hear the word and receive it, come up unto me and be there
58:12 -  such men have to be sent this is a mission this is the backbone
58:21 -  the heart of proclamation the word is more than just information the word is more than just information
58:30 -  it becomes a point of encounter it's revelation it pierces
58:39 -  and men who up to that time like my Jewish kinsmen who can discuss any subject
58:49 -  and never get ruffled very cordial until they hear the gospel
58:58 -  in the power of God apostolically expressed in power and the mask of civility comes off
59:07 -  and the teeth are bare that gnash upon us one will either fall before the man
59:16 -  who brings such a word and say men and brethren what must we do to be saved or they will gnash upon us
59:25 -  and seek to destroy us that's why the apostles are almost always the martyrs
59:34 -  they are a saver of life unto life unto son they are a saver of life unto life unto son they are a saver of life unto life unto son
59:43 -  and a saver of death unto death unto others and a saver of death unto death unto others they represent God
59:52 -  and they bear God they have that treasure in their earthen vessels they are wood
01:00:01 -  and humanity that is gnarled and twisted with their history but they are encased in gold
01:00:10 -  within and without imagine a whole church like that in Monterrey
01:00:19 -  in Mexico imagine a church like that in Latin America and Jews will be passing through it
01:00:28 -  how will they not be saved in the reality that they will see and the word they will hear
01:00:37 -  that they cannot regainsay nor rebuke, repudiate it's a word of authority it's a sent word
01:00:46 -  and the sender himself is in it we ourselves were modeling today my brothers and I
01:01:08 -  we were talking about you we are men of broad experience and travel
01:01:17 -  but I said where have we met a congregation like this where the speaker can speak for an hour
01:01:26 -  and 45 minutes never losing the attention of the audience
01:01:35 -  and the pastor gets up and himself speaks for 20-30 minutes and they hear and receive the entire thing
01:02:03 -  so there's resurrection power in that speaking the same life of God
01:02:12 -  that raised Jesus from the dead is the life, the animation of power in the speaking of those who are sent
01:02:21 -  they are eminently the men of the resurrection their word and their persons
01:02:30 -  are in full resurrection power they are already in the resurrection already in the eternal place
01:02:39 -  Paul says I have my citizenship in heaven I have my citizenship in heaven yes I'm a Hebrew of the Hebrews
01:02:48 -  but the things that constitute the truth of me are not drawn from the earth but from heaven
01:02:57 -  and it's this heaven that I commend to men and to make touch the sense of it now and in this life
01:03:06 -  unless it comes to them too late on the day of eternity when it will be too late to call
01:03:15 -  on him who they have not really heard because no one had really preached and they have not heard
01:03:25 -  because no one had really preached because no one had really been sent we have watched souls pass
01:03:36 -  from death to life even this dear rabbi which I'm asking you to keep quietly to yourself
01:03:45 -  we mustn't go out and boast about this the man is still alive
01:03:55 -  with an oxygen tube in his nose maybe he has only days to live but he knows now where he's going
01:04:04 -  and he has the peace that passes all understanding what is apostolic is real
01:04:24 -  what is real is authentic what is authentic is God the apostle is the
01:04:33 -  missionary of reality things as they in fact are things as they in fact are
01:04:42 -  things as they in fact are things as they in fact are things as they in fact are
01:04:51 -  as God sees them and as we have meant to know them in a world that lies in deception
01:05:00 -  in a world that lies in deception it's a wicked one who's a liar from the beginning
01:05:09 -  and needs to be confronted and the truth needs to be revealed because the true apostle
01:05:18 -  not only speaks the message he is the message in himself he is the thing in himself
01:05:27 -  and his character in his life through and through what then would such a church be
01:05:36 -  but a glory to God forever but a glory to God forever so these men bear
01:05:49 -  the power of the word because they bear the Lord himself because they bear the Lord himself
01:05:58 -  they are encased in gold in the character of God which is beaten out of gold
01:06:07 -  which is beaten out of gold they haven't learned this they haven't learned this in the school of convenience
01:06:16 -  they learned it in hardship in heartache heartache
01:06:25 -  struggle in opposition and if they can't find such opposition anywhere else in the world
01:06:34 -  God will give it to them and their wives or they'll have it in the church or in their own family
01:06:43 -  tension, conflict is the shaping factor beating something out of gold
01:06:52 -  which should become itself and joy where God will meet with them and be with them
01:07:01 -  as they are sent so do you desire this?
01:07:11 -  or you just want to be a Pentecostal body nice services
01:07:20 -  good biblical teaching good worship there's something more
01:07:29 -  something higher there's a word that God wants to revive and the reality of that word
01:07:39 -  apostle, apostolic sent the thing in itself
01:07:51 -  having the character of God seeking nothing for itself knowing that it will either be received or opposed
01:08:01 -  I will either cry out what must we do to be saved or seek to cast us over the hill
01:08:12 -  and it's all the same we don't fear and we were just as content to remain
01:08:21 -  at Antioch in worship as to be sent we have no itch to be ministers
01:08:34 -  no ambition to be seen and heard we have no career to promote we are just as content to remain
01:08:46 -  hidden and obscure in the place of worship together as in the place of sending
01:08:57 -  separate unto me men who are already separated from their religious ambitions
01:09:08 -  their racial and ethnic origins I'm more lightly complected than you I'm more Spanish
01:09:20 -  you're more Indian these men have been separated from the deepest things
01:09:29 -  that govern men and dominate men and lead from fear and tension to opposition they're liberated
01:09:39 -  they bring the message of heaven they transcend their culture transcend their nationality
01:09:49 -  they are the messengers of a heavenly way the reality of God and where do they learn it
01:09:59 -  when do they come to it in Antioch in the church that was in Antioch
01:10:08 -  made up of black and white and Jew and Gentile in all of the raw natural ingredients the church of diverse differences
01:10:19 -  there in truth and in love in openness and humility in confession, communion
01:10:30 -  they rose above, they transcended they were separated from the earthly things
01:10:40 -  that poison and corrupt men and therefore could be sent the issue of Paul is the issue of Antioch
01:10:52 -  he's not some magical thing in himself and if I have had any value for you in these days thank my wife
01:11:04 -  the opposition, the tension, the difficulty thank my fellowship and my community the opposition, the differences
01:11:14 -  everyone with his own thought and opinion with scriptures to prove it you want to spit your guts out
01:11:23 -  it seems irreconcilable but you hold steady and you remain
01:11:32 -  and you continue on face to face and you don't turn away and in that place God meets you
01:11:41 -  and you will never have imagined and the brother that you thought was your worst enemy he becomes your deepest friend and ally
01:11:54 -  because we continue to look in each other's faces and wouldn't turn away and so the issue of righteousness
01:12:05 -  through the place of mercy I want to dedicate you as the Antioch of God
01:12:15 -  for this city perhaps this nation we're not here by accident
01:12:24 -  nobody else wanted us you took us in and have received the benefit
01:12:33 -  we have an authority to preach and to teach but also to bless
01:12:47 -  preach and to bless to bless to bless
01:12:58 -  to bless to bless to bless
01:13:07 -  priestly authority to confer blessing which is more than just a nice feeling
01:13:16 -  but a conferring of something palpable and real that was not there before
01:13:25 -  until it came through a sent one because the blessing is the Lord himself his prayer
01:13:34 -  his desire receive it Lord in Jesus name
01:13:44 -  a day of new beginnings not that we are in any way making little what has taken place till this moment
01:13:53 -  from this pastor everything was given of God it was a preparation for now
01:14:05 -  for the Cairo's time that has come the set time to favor Zion this Zion
01:14:14 -  has come it's time for an apostolic reality in the nation of Mexico
01:14:23 -  and in Latin America that can send forth preachers whose word creates faith and they hear it
01:14:32 -  that they might be saved that perform the works of God that confront the authorities of the world
01:14:41 -  and the things that are false and don't serve them so Lord in Yeshua's holy name
01:14:50 -  I preach the apostle of all confession in your name in your name I bless this people
01:14:59 -  let something come down to them from heaven from above to settle upon their souls
01:15:08 -  to find its way into the very root and foundation of their corporate life a depth of understanding
01:15:17 -  and of desire and appreciation and appreciation
01:15:26 -  for that which is apostolic not just to admire it but to become it
01:15:35 -  bless this Antioch Lord and make it a sending body and make it a sending body
01:15:44 -  that this nation will receive the benefit the real thing the real thing
01:15:53 -  that reveals the counterfeit simply by being the thing in itself a people who are able to discern
01:16:02 -  that which is sent of God and that which is sent of man who are able to identify
01:16:11 -  those who say they are apostles and do not and do not
01:16:20 -  because they themselves are living in apostolic reality and instantly can sense
01:16:29 -  that which is false and presumptuous religious and human
01:16:38 -  and are jealous of the truth and the reality of God of such a great word
01:16:47 -  because they have a heavenly calling and they consider the High Priest and the Apostle of their confession
01:16:56 -  even Jesus Christ in whose name we pray seal this Lord
01:17:05 -  Amen
