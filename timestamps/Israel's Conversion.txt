Israel's Conversion

00:00 -  If I have understood you were right in what you have been quickening in Romans 11 as the point in beginning for these three nights, then give now precious unction to that word. Open the understanding of your people and give us even something more than memorable,
00:18 -  even something more than significant. Give us an historic occasion, an event that will be consequential, my God, in the very things that you are describing, and for that we thank and give you praise in Jesus' name,
00:31 -  God's people said, amen. Turn to Romans 11, verse 26. This is jumping in feet first.
00:43 -  Everybody understands the significance of Romans 11. Romans 9 through 11 is the statement of Paul on the great mystery of which he was steward among the other mysteries of the church, given to him as the least of all saints.
01:03 -  And it's the heart of Paul's most systematic statement of his apostolic theology. He's not a systematic theologian. Paul writes in mysteries himself, as even Peter said, that he's difficult to be understood.
01:20 -  Which scriptures some men rest in advantage to themselves as they do also the scriptures. Paul is not easy. But in Romans, we have the clearest, most systematic statement of Paul's apostolic mind
01:37 -  on the subject of Israel and the church, which he calls a mystery, rightly so. And some scholars have said that Romans chapter 1 through 8 is the preparation for the introduction of this great theme, and 12 through 16 is the outworking of the remarkable statement
01:57 -  made in those three central chapters, 9 through 11. So 11 is the climax to Paul's whole dissertation. As I have looked to the Lord today, this scripture about Zion kind of found a place in my spirit.
02:19 -  Let's start from verse 25, for I are not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in.
02:36 -  And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the Deliverer and shall turn away unGodliness from Jacob, for this is my covenant with them when I shall take away their sins.
02:51 -  What thinkest thou of a statement like that, that is so remarkably compact, that says so much, that entire volumes could be written in the commentary of these few words, and that generations of believers have either read through it, read around it, or ignored
03:14 -  it, and I would say in my own 40 years as a believer, and all around the world in every aspect of the church, there is a profound ignorance of this mystery. And yet Paul said, I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery, and in that he
03:31 -  suggests that there'll be a penalty. Of all the mysteries, to forfeit this one is to make yourself a candidate for conceit, which is to say deception.
03:44 -  You'll become inflated and pompous and arrogant and self-assured, while you might even go so far as to think that the church is itself the kingdom of God, that it need not even wait for the king to make his appearance, or equally as rambunctious and vain is to
04:03 -  think that God is finished with Israel, and that now you have yourself become the Israel of God, and that they had their opportunity and blew it, and now God has passed the baton onto you.
04:14 -  So that Paul begins by answering the question of the church at Rome, is God finished with the Jew? They give every appearance of being finished, they've slain their messiah as they did the
04:25 -  prophets that were sent unto them, are we now the Israel of God? And Paul, in the most emphatic language in Greek, and I don't understand Greek, but I'm told that when he says, God forbid that you should believe that, it is as strenuous and
04:42 -  as vehement a statement as the apostle could have made. I forbid that you should think that God is finished with Israel, they are only temporarily set aside, they have stumbled.
04:55 -  And then he even gives an explanation that they have stumbled, that through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, well that's nice, but then in the way that he does, he completes the statement in a way that blows your mind, that salvation has come to the
05:13 -  Gentiles so as to move them to jealousy. What are you saying, Paul, that there's a divine stratagem for our salvation as Gentiles that has a purpose beyond the benefit that we receive in being saved?
05:28 -  Exactly, and if you don't see it and take it to your heart as mandate, as the very purpose central for your being as church, you disfigure church itself, you lose the identification of church as church, which cannot be seen or understood except in its relationship with
05:46 -  this people out of whose salvation you have received, for salvation is of the Jews. How did you guys get into the act? Because God in his mercy, seeing that you were without God and without hope in the world
06:01 -  and drinking blood out of skulls and fornicating like jackrabbits and full of violence and terror has made known to you the so great salvation of God that was reserved and unique only to Jews, so much so that Peter required a vision, a trance of a sheet coming down
06:21 -  with unclean animals and God saying, Peter, take and eat, but Lord, I have never eaten anything unclean, what I have called clean, what I have made clean, call thou not unclean, and no sooner did he wake from that vision than there were Gentiles at the door calling
06:38 -  him to come and to share the faith with Cornelius and his Roman house, and as he was sharing the Holy Spirit fell. You know, dear saints, we need to recapture this.
06:53 -  You need to recapture this because you don't sufficiently appreciate the salvation that has come to you that was exclusively the property of Jews. You don't sufficiently appreciate that you were grafted into a tree other than your own,
07:07 -  and if you don't acknowledge that and you're only just, what shall I say, technically grafted in, but not existentially and appreciatively grafted in, you'll not enjoy the benefit of the sap, you'll not produce fruit, you'll still be as you were a wild branch, even though
07:27 -  you're grafted in, you're not receiving the benefit of that engrafting unless you acknowledge with gratitude the so great mercy of God to give you a place in their tree. I don't blame you for wanting to shun that knowledge, seeing that the tree is not eye
07:44 -  appealing and gnarled and twisted with such a contortion of history that you almost want to avert your gaze, and for the same reason we're not quick to acknowledge that the God who is our God is also the God of Jacob. You have to live in my shoes, you have to be with
08:02 -  me in Germany. A couple of years ago when I was with Klaus and we went to a Jewish cemetery, it's not that I'm morbid, but somehow if there's a Jewish cemetery I'll find it, if there's a Jewish soul I'll find it, and we went to this cemetery a few miles from where I was to
08:25 -  be speaking that night, and the tombstones were so heavy from the 14th century and so eroded by time and wind that you could barely make out the Hebrew inscriptions. They were so monumental in size that the Nazis could not knock them over. Do you know what it means for a Jew whose name is
08:45 -  Katz to walk in and through such a place and to get the sense of the Jewish existence in Germany for 2,000 years? So profound that you can't tell where the word German ends and Jewish begins. There are many other things that we enjoyed like lox and bagels is actually lox is a German word
09:07 -  meaning spoke salmon which I fed these children when they were with me in Brooklyn on a bagel which was almost as important as my counsel. So there's a sense of melancholy when you see the evidence of the long presence in Germany of Jewish
09:28 -  people and what the end was in that land which they celebrated so much and admired culturally so profoundly that they thought this cannot come upon us. This dark thing that is having its origin in the basement of beer halls through the punk scum the lowest expressions of German
09:52 -  civilization culture and now coming to the place of political power that can't last because this is the land of Gerda, Schiller, Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kant with the great philosopher the great ethicist and Jews if anything are ethical.
10:09 -  And so what happened there are German identification collapsed they went up in smoke and so it's something to walk through Germany and ponder these things and also to know that there's a big monument to the Holocaust now being laid in Berlin right by the Reichstag
10:29 -  right by the central government that occupies two three or four football fields of immense granite blocks that I think a thousand or more to indicate something of the loss of Jewish life. It's the Jew rubbing the face of the German into the grip of his own history.
10:48 -  Why are we like that overkill isn't enough just to have a simple monument and and to touch both German and Jewish consideration to the tragedy the mutual aspects of the tragedy in which we have had part and for which we are both guilty no we had to lay out concrete blocks and
11:09 -  and football fields and we'll show them and so what are we doing we're provoking a new anti-Semitism by our own overt overreaction to the past. You can't win unless you know the Lord so I'll be I'll be in Berlin in just a few weeks
11:30 -  and other places in Germany. So I came to that meeting that night charismatic and oh they were excited Jewish speaker novelty and I looked out on their precious German faces and my first question was I've just visited the Jewish cemetery showing a presence of Jews going back into the 14th century
11:52 -  how is it that my kinsmen lived in the midst of you in your Christian nation and perished without any knowledge that the God whom you ostensibly celebrate is the God of Jacob. Dead silence jaws dropping because these dear charismatic saints had never once reflected
12:16 -  that the God whom they worship is the God of Jacob and God is not ashamed to designate that title in his relationship to this Jacob people only we are ashamed we're embarrassed we don't want that association that identification and yet if we avoid it we'll have missed the
12:39 -  mystery for which we were saved and the great concluding redemptive drama by which human history is itself concluded and the king of Israel comes and establishes rule and guess what place no other than the physical literal Jerusalem now such a bone of contention among nations and
13:02 -  will become increasingly so why because Isaiah said the law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem and nations shall study war no more. Believers doubt this well you're unusual then because there's very little expectation of an actual kingdom
13:27 -  to be found in Christendom in my experience somehow we've lost the sense of it and it has become diminished into some kind of subjective inward thing the kingdom of God within or the principles of the kingdom as they function in the church but there's no political there's no theocratic
13:47 -  expectation of an actual rule of God over his creation out of a literal place of his choosing called Zion and to lose that dear saints is to lose everything and so we have lost the expectation of a kingdom with that nexus and that center an exact proportion as we have lost or not known
14:11 -  the mystery of Israel itself. That's why it's so central to Paul's whole consideration and it needs to become central to us or will continue to be mere charismatics forever. You understand I'm speaking symbolically.
14:30 -  What I'm saying is there's something more and above charismatic but we will be fixed at that lesser level until we come into the recognition and the appreciation and the participation of the fulfillment of this mystery which compels us by necessity being so
14:51 -  remarkable in its dimensions to become saints and to become it corporately. That's the Zion that this scripture speaks of. The deliverer shall come out of Zion and if he'll not come out of Zion he'll not come and Zion as I hope to show you tonight or in these
15:11 -  nights is a key word of a mystery word that is suggestive of the completion of God's purposes through the church coming of age when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. That fullness is something more than numerical. It's not God waiting only for the completion of a number
15:35 -  although the number is significant. Why is that hard? Because we're going to replace fallen angels. Don't you know the present principalities and powers of the air who have followed that usurper the prince of this world will be displaced from their governmental location in the heavenlies
15:59 -  they're the principalities and powers of the air that oppose the purposes of God that alienate men from God that foster identifications with idolatry and sport and music jazz not you I love jazz cheap stuff to win turn men from God to themselves that's why that chapter of the
16:22 -  principalities and powers is so remarkably significant they're to be displaced and God intended them as a governmental how shall I say it accompaniment to order and creation so that men in the order established through the influence of these powers over nations would be free and
16:43 -  undistracted in the pursuit of the knowledge of him for Paul tells us in act 17 that God has of one blood made all nations of men that they might seek after God if happily they might be found of him here's a here's an apostolic mentality that blows the philosophers right out of the picture
17:01 -  who are every day wanting to hear some new thing some novelty and here's this Hebrew this lower piece of apostolic scum bearing already his wounds telling them that the whole purpose of life the whole purpose of creation the whole purpose of nations the whole purpose of race
17:21 -  is to seek after God that you might be found of him which the powers of darkness seek to pervert and to prevent and will be displaced by things taking place in the earth in proportion as the church itself comes of age and defeats the powers my getting ahead of myself in the same way that
17:42 -  they suffered their initial defeat by the testimony of Jesus at the cross or you've got to be sophisticated seems to keep up with what I'm rattling on what are you saying God I'm saying that the initial defeat by Jesus of the powers of the air who made of them an open
18:04 -  spectacle and disarmed them by something that he demonstrated in his suffering unto death at the cross for had they known they would not have crucified the lord of glory they did not know that having him in the at their hand and in their mercy and applying their satanic wisdom of
18:24 -  destruction and violence they were producing and giving opportunity for the display of the character of God himself most profoundly revealed in suffering for suffering reveals and ultimate suffering reveals ultimately what does it reveal it reveals the benign nature of
18:47 -  God who says lay not this into their church who receives the suffering as being from the sovereign hand of God and serving the redemptive purposes of the father and can receive it with equanimity and grace and not rail again at those who are railing at him there's another wisdom there's a
19:07 -  conflict of wisdoms and when the church at the end of the age in its suffering occasioned by its identification with the Jews as was true of those who did so in the Nazi time like Corey Ten Boom who went to the concentration camp with her father with her sister being caught in
19:27 -  suckering Jews will be exactly again and much larger proportion the scenario of the last days that will occasion our suffering for their sake and somehow in the remarkable way in which this buckshot is being scattered I'm assuming that the lord's purposes are being served
19:45 -  amen I would much prefer aesthetically a more ordered presentation which the lord sometimes gives but this is not the time and that's not for me to order or command just to allow him to do his thing okay let's look more closely at this centerpiece of Paul's remarkable dissertation
20:11 -  on a mystery in which he says that we should not be ignorant lest we would suffer a very particular consequence which is in evidence today in the church everywhere and that it's a mystery and a mystery requires a revelation you cannot adduce a mystery by the exercise of one's mind mystery
20:32 -  must be revealed how is it then that we could be ignorant because we have not been conducive to the receiving of revelation there's something in our hearts an attitude against Jews or that we don't relish the fact that God yet has a purpose for them and we like to see them replaced or
20:52 -  shunted to the sidelines that keeps us from the recognition of the mystery and so with my own experience over the years in contact with some of the leading spokesmen in the charismatic realm men whose names you would know if i mentioned almost invariably confess and say art i've never
21:13 -  understood roman's 11 or roman's 9th 11 and it's always remained to me a mystery and so i finally after years of hearing things like that i thought well okay brother i can understand that though you're a gifted speaker and the lord has opened to you realms of revelation of other things of
21:32 -  significance but that he has omitted this is a remarkable consideration not that it has been omitted but that you have not repented for the failure to have received the revelation and put before God the fact that you may be disqualified by some attitude for who for which
21:52 -  repentance he's waiting and that you've not either recognized or given are you following me that that the mystery has been denied you is a statement of judgment for attitudes that you're carrying that in God's sight are reprehensible and and negate any possibility of receiving the
22:11 -  very revelation i'll give you a for instance i won't even mention them because i can't remember it but you would know it if i if i could a well-known speaker who subsequently has divorced his wife and married his secretary maybe he's done it again since i don't know but he came to speak
22:28 -  at our plane field new jersey assembly when i was a very young believer and he was english and it's with the english i've had my greatest difficulty you explained that to me i've been treated rudely in great britain by some of the most prominent and advanced expressions of the
22:50 -  of the church calling themselves apostolic have walked out of a meeting where i spoke before them on romans 11 because i came late to the meeting excuse me these personal reminiscences and i had diarrhea and they had to find me a place to go party before i could get to the meeting
23:10 -  and so i got there late and out of breath and the meeting is in progress and i barely sat down and it's time to be called up to speak and then lord i'm i'm out of breath and i'm not prepared i don't know what romans 11 said i said romans 11 look that's that's that's basic stuff that's
23:26 -  you know romans 11 okay i got up and spoke on romans 11 in such a way as i had never before nor since heard myself speak it was a treat it was i don't know with humor with it was literary but the faces were aghast i couldn't understand why they were looking that way
23:50 -  they were pained as if i had talked i was speaking about public orgies or some other totally disagreeable thing and and yet i went on and finished even looking at that inhospitable see your faces especially from their leadership and when i finished and sat down they got up and
24:07 -  left the building there was no thank you but no thank you no concluding prayer no debate no they were they left the building i'd never ever experienced such rudeness but one guy had to remain to serve tea being english of course he must go on and so i'm dangling a cup and i'm
24:31 -  saying to this elder you know my dear brother i i'm not expecting that your leadership or congregation is necessarily obliged to agree with my perspective but i will say that it is a sound biblical perspective and held by giants of the faith historically and i've not i can't understand
24:54 -  this untoward and impolite conduct that you would not even expect from the the elks and the lions and and world's fraternal orders i'm getting from a church that calls itself apostolic i said you tell your leaders they're flirting with judgment in the rude way in which the word
25:16 -  and its minister was dismissed why am i telling you that about english resistance there's something about great britain and i say japan has the highest production of anti-semitic literature in the world what contact have they with jews except both japan and great britain
25:37 -  were former empires and there may be some vestigial hangover and even hope for a future day in the sun where the issue of Israel becoming the center point of all nations is the most disagreeable consideration i don't know if you know it well you at your leisure look at deuteronomy 32
26:00 -  not now where it says that when God determined the number of the nations he did so in proportion to the sons of Israel i've never heard anyone preach on that verse suggesting that there's a mystery in the election of God and the issue of his world rule
26:21 -  by which this despised nation with its terrible track record and apostasy and backsliddenness is to be central to all nations and that out of its sign and its druslim shall go forth the word of the lord to nations and those nations that will refuse to acknowledge God's election
26:39 -  and choice not predicated on their successful track record or their virtue but simply on the basis of his choosing because i will be whom i will be and i will choose whom i will choose and i will have mercy upon whom i'll have mercy go eat your heart out i know it's not your choice
26:57 -  you would have preferred mount something in california rather than that little pimple of a hill in zion but that's exactly why i have chosen it to show you your gentile arrogance and and your predominance and wanting to assert your geography over my choosing i've chose them
27:14 -  not because they're the greatest because they are least to demonstrate that i'm the sovereign God and my choosing is not predicated on the merit of any man or any nation but simply on the basis that i am God and i will have mercy upon whom i will have mercy and if that bothers you you
27:32 -  have an argument with me and your anti-semitism at its heart that rankles you against the jew is really your controversy with me and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written listen saints what kind of a church are we that is not concerned to see the fulfillment of what is written
27:53 -  according to the covenant that i have made with them that is not concerned for the fulfillment of covenants that God will make how is God God if what he writes is not fulfilled how is God God if his covenants are not secure and he cannot fulfill them even over and against the unwillingness
28:12 -  of the people with whom he is covenanted he says the gifts and callings of God are irrevocable they're without repentance where does he say that roman's 11 it's not based on their willingness even and that's why we wrote the book with chosen for what because most jews don't want to be chosen
28:30 -  we want to be the hong kong of the middle east we want commercial success we want careers we don't want to be a people central to the purposes of God whom we don't know no but he's saying despite your unwillingness i must fulfill my intention that has been declared
28:51 -  out of my mouth or how then am i God so we're the church and we're not jealous for his name his honor his reputation his ability to fulfill his word all the more dramatic and all the more glories when it's fulfilled through an unwilling nation and a nation whose track record gives no
29:10 -  promise of fulfillment or deserving of choice then we have missed the issue of God and yet we're singing our choruses so i would not brother and have you to be ignorant repent if you are for it's already a statement of judgment that there's something uncomely in your own heart and
29:28 -  attitude against those whom i've chosen which is the statement of your attitude against me and therefore you cannot receive my revelation why then have you not repented and been broken before me at the failure to understand and to commend that central mandate and call that is
29:48 -  not just the issue of Israel it's the issue of the church as the church and if the church fails to be apprehended by this mystery and to be the agent of its fulfillment how then is it the church is it the church how does it come to the place by which it shall be a bride for the bridegroom
30:07 -  if is and if it's not prepared for the trial and the demand of an ultimate kind that comes in the mystery of their relationship with my jewish people to forsake them is to forsake the church's own identity and its own fulfillment and to disqualify it for its own eternal inheritance
30:27 -  at its place in the heavenlies ruling and reigning with christ from heavenly places can you understand that so blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in here's where you have to become prophetic and intuitive and to become prophetic
30:51 -  and intuitive offends many people in the church the place from which i just came in the east bay the brother was offended when i said i have a certain understanding that has been given to me by virtue of my office and call prophetically and that i'm given a way to intuit and understand
31:11 -  the significance of prophetic scripture that is not given to others that's why the church waits on the foundations laid by the apostles and the prophets that a teacher cannot himself perform he was a teacher offended at my assertion that there are yet
31:27 -  prophets and apostles in the earth who are foundational to the church and that the fullness of the gentiles is not only the numeric quantity but the quality of a kind for which God waits that when it's obtained the gentiles are no longer gentiles
31:48 -  they have come to a place of transcendence and for the want of a better word they have become hebraic they have become davidic they're like the psalmists they're like the prophets they they have transcended the limitations of their own national cultures and ethnic origins
32:08 -  and have come to become the people of God as a bride adorned for the bridegroom that's that means you have to rise out of your african skin and out of your white bourgeois middle-class california skin to come into something of so transcendent the kind that God waits for it
32:25 -  eternally and until his bridegroom has such a bride he'll not have dominion over the earth because dominion is given to them he must have a vice regent he must have a wife suitable a wife suitable for his the majesty of his call being adorned for the bridegroom
32:49 -  having the same quality of life of integrity of character as is in the bridegroom himself which is far more than what we presently know or even desire or are willing to sacrifice to obtain and what i'm saying is this and i'll close with it for now this is the mystery
33:08 -  the mystery is that God has locked us in a reciprocal relationship with the people Israel the jacob nation the jews worldwide even in their present condition who look upon us not only with suspicion but with contempt the church how icky can you get how fundamental how how crude how
33:31 -  reactionary how lacking the two most antithetical bodies in the earth as contemporary jewelry and the contemporary church and God is saying i've called you to a reciprocal relationship with these people that will make of you an ultimate demand not made by any other people
33:53 -  or any other ministry this is not just another ethnic group that needs to be saved like gypsies or puerto rican's or filipinos this is the people of God in their historic apostasy of whom Paul says in the same 11th chapter they are the enemies of the gospel talk about apostolic
34:15 -  candor c-a-n-d-o-r he's not fudging he's not mincing words they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake who needs them hey listen you guys come visit me in new york and i'll take you to the Lubavitcher Hasidim where i've been thrown out of the classroom
34:34 -  and other places in my rabbi with whom i've been meeting weekly who finally shut me down and said we can't go on erin because you're deceived and you need to be delivered because you you subscribe to the deceiver the sorcerer and the men who shut me out of the hasidic classroom because i believe
34:53 -  in Jesus said you believe in a sorcerer a magician who learned from us these tricks and how to walk on water in order to distract jews from the law to follow him you cannot believe how poisonous the attitude is in jewish orthodoxy and the references in the talmud to the illegitimate
35:13 -  birth of Jesus ascribed to a an affair between mary and a roman soldier and many other disgraceful references which historically they had to remove because the nations in which the talmud was published were not permitted but they kept it in their secret archives and now they're saying
35:35 -  we are putting it back in there's an open deep seated hostility against the lord and against this people everything is stacked against us you can't understand how we are perceived and yet except through us they'll not see the glory of God except through our mercy that
35:57 -  Paul says that by your mercy they may obtain mercy they will not have it and historically when have they needed it and when will they need it more than the coming cataclysm and cataclysm of which Jesus spoke will exceed anything that the nation has previously known or will again know
36:14 -  it's coming saints it'll make a ultimate requirement of us even unto threat and risk of our peril of our own safety and our own lives and when jews will see that from gentiles it transcends religion there they'll see God and that's what he says in ezekiel 20 i will meet with
36:35 -  you face to face in the wilderness of california and kenya and uganda and all the nations where i will uproot and sift my people for i will sift them through all nations not only for the nation's sake not only for the jews sake but for the nations themselves and the church within the nations
36:54 -  that will be to them the least of these my brethren what they ought to i said to these africans you'll be you'll do that in that day you'll extend mercy in that day to
37:06 -  the least of these his brethren steven spielberg and and uh the head the ceo of walt disney corporation and wall street and all these men of affluence and means who'll find themselves stripped and stinking not having bathed or showered and how long and with rotting with
37:26 -  sores and cancers and and wounds and coming to you in that bloody and filthy condition that you'll be able to extend mercy as as if they were the the least of these his brethren that they're jews and they're white and they'll be your brethren then what about the blacks right now
37:43 -  who are poor and stinking and and uh without employment you'll be able to extend mercy to jews then and not to your black insman now the light was breaking and they have to be righteous now to their own if they'll be righteous to the least of his brethren then see the tension see
38:05 -  the reality see the mystery see the wisdom of God lost to the church which explains in one fell swoop our lamentable condition let's pray lord we're not willing to remain in this condition the issue of the church is not our enjoyment but the fulfillment of your glory as Paul even ends
38:30 -  romans 11 for up of him and through him and to him be glory forever he had his apostolic head screwed on right the issue of faith is your glory forever and it will come by the remarkable thing that you will perform at the end of the age when all Israel shall be saved as it is written
38:49 -  because of the covenant that you have made with them for the deliverer will come out of zion and zion will be the nexus of the church that has come of age out of which you can come to be their deliverer so lord continue on to give us understanding and perception of what our calling is and a heart my
39:11 -  God to fulfill it only as the church not as virtuoso art cats individuals but as the church in its corporate makeup and the truth of its corporateness to take upon itself these burdens that have this heart and be capable of extending this mercy because they have received mercy
39:33 -  bless us tonight lord you've troubled us you've set new thoughts into our consideration and you've left them dangling you haven't dotted the i's and crossed the t's because you're treating us as sons and daughters that have done have to get it all in one night and we can be allowed to
39:49 -  go in out in a place yet of of incompletion and agitation and that will keep us up perhaps in part of the night or bring us to our knees or into the text so we thank you lord come precious God and pour out your soul in these days follow this up my God this breaking in this setting this blade
40:12 -  into this hard earth turn it over and break it up and and give us my God such a depth of understanding comprehension of the mystery to which we will give ourselves freely that you might receive glory both now and forever in Jesus name we pray and God's people said amen
