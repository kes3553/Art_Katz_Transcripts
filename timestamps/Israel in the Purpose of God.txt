Israel in the Purpose of God

00:00 -  You see how the subject of Israel brings you into a whole apostolic and prophetic mindset. You're going to see how frequently these words come up, not only out of my own mouth, but out of authors that we will be quoting.
00:18 -  So, such is the nature of exile as final extremity and ultimate catastrophe. In it are raised the issues of theodicy, judgment, the word of God, the prophetic ministry, and the interpretation of Scripture itself.
00:31 -  It's as if we had gone down this list. Theodicy is a fancy word that means, how do you justify God or understand God in catastrophe? Where was God in the Holocaust? It's the issue of theodicy.
00:46 -  Theo is God. So, that's a very great question. And once you get into that, it opens up whole dimensions of the faith.
00:56 -  And the interpretation of Scripture itself in an ultimate way that searches the inquirer even as he inquires. We're searching, but we're being searched, as we'll see increasingly how much of this is personal and raises questions about where you yourself are and where you are in your own inner man,
01:19 -  even as we're talking about general questions. Now, I've got a statement up on the board that deserves some examination. Out of this book, Commentary on Zechariah, I'm going to be introducing you to some outstanding writers.
01:37 -  And I can't tell you how blessed I am by this commentary by David Barron, who was a Hebrew Christian giant in England in the late 19th century. One of the treats for me is not only the sharpness and the ruthless logic and analytical power that he brings to the word,
02:02 -  but the use of language in his own writing. His writing, his pen, is like a sword. I mean, there's no flap. It's such a use of the English language that you just admire that expression.
02:18 -  And the depth of things that he touches, as we will see here and in other places as we go on. So here's a book that I would greatly recommend. It's an older book. The publisher is Kregel, K-R-E-G-L-G-E-L, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
02:36 -  So the Commentary on Zechariah is very rich and very deep, and I've been very blessed. Now, here's a statement that he makes in page 94 of his book. And I wrote, I made a little footnote in the book of this statement,
02:55 -  a concise summary of the whole mystery of Israel in this one paragraph. And I want to take this paragraph apart with you to show you how that contains in itself a summation of the whole mystery of the subject of Israel, expressed in just a few statements.
03:16 -  And then in the examination of that statement, learning something about how to read in an analytical and critical way. I was sharing with a brother the other day. My last stop in Germany was with some precious saints who had become dear,
03:35 -  and they invited a few houseguests that final night, and they were all of the same quality. Precious, of whom the world is not worthy. And I said the next morning before I left to this woman, I said,
03:46 -  what's your relationship with these people? Oh, she said we were all raised up in the faith by the same teacher. I said, oh? And she was a woman without any intellectual or worldly distinction. Very simple woman. She groomed us in the faith.
04:04 -  I said, well, what made her teaching distinctive? She said this art. She would hesitate and brood over every word in the scripture. Like, for example, God so loved the world. God.
04:21 -  So loved. What does it mean? So loved. The world. Does it mean the nation? You know, she would just come in and would not allow a word or a syllable to escape the deepest scrutiny and examination.
04:39 -  It's a mindset. It's a way of examining. And I'll tell you that if you can cultivate that, it not only opens up the scriptures, but any printed word and will affect your own way in speaking and writing,
04:52 -  which is our distinctive, prophetically, and as human beings. So let's look at this. And having known and foreknown them,
05:03 -  yea, with all their many sins and backsliding, and purposed in his heart to exhibit in and through them, not only his holy severity, but even in a more wonderful way,
05:17 -  his infinite grace and goodness, and all the attributes of his character, for the blessing of all the nations of the earth.
05:26 -  That is a mouthful. In one statement, I don't know that David Dahn, a Hebrew Christian writer, by the way,
05:37 -  was even conscious of how much he was saying, but he is summing up the whole mystery of God's choice of Israel as the revelation of himself.
05:49 -  You shall be witnesses unto me, is our calling, but Israel was his first witness nation. If you don't understand that, you're missing the great key.
06:02 -  Israel is not the thing in itself. It is a means to a much larger end, the revelation of God to the nations.
06:12 -  I'll just take a shot at something. What is the glory of God? This is not going to be an exhaustive definition,
06:22 -  but I suspect that the glory of God is only the glory when it is exhibited through another vessel other than God himself.
06:32 -  In other words, God's glory is his glory when it is shown through the Church, through earthen vessels.
06:38 -  Or else it doesn't have a framework, it doesn't have a context in which it can be exhibited. It's his glory when it comes out of an earthen vessel,
06:48 -  when you see the radiance of his glory, or out of a temple, which is the same thing. It requires a contrivance, which is itself holy
06:57 -  and in keeping with the character of that glory, whether it's a temple, a Church, an individual, or a nation. God intended that his glory would be revealed through Israel.
07:10 -  For example, the Sabbath. What is the Sabbath if it's not demonstrated through the conduct of the people?
07:16 -  It's only an abstract principle. What is love? What is the Church if it's not
07:22 -  the actual outworking of relationships through a corporate body? He's got to have a framework,
07:29 -  a vessel as his witness. Or else it's just the abstract voice coming out of heaven to men on earth,
07:36 -  which is not God's vehicle for revealing itself. And he reveals himself through things that we would think that he would not have chosen.
07:46 -  The least of things. He says of Israel, I didn't choose you because you were the greatest.
07:50 -  I chose you because you were the least. But here's the point. One thing we can learn already,
07:56 -  that the definition of God requires us to understand that he's the God who chooses. I chose you.
08:03 -  That out of his own sovereignty, out of his own will, out of what he is in himself,
08:09 -  he chooses. He elects. He makes choices.
08:14 -  He will be who he will be. He will do what he will do. And that is God.
08:20 -  And if we don't understand that as God, we don't understand God. He makes specific choices,
08:26 -  and he makes them contrary to what we think he ought to choose. He chooses the least.
08:32 -  He takes the beggars off the dung heap, and he makes them to sit with princes. He takes the high school dropouts.
08:38 -  He takes the dumb ones. He takes the refuse that rejects the off scouring of the earth.
08:44 -  And he makes them to be the vessels of his glory. He takes the murderer and makes him the chief apostle.
08:50 -  That's God. So to know that he both chooses in the expression of his sovereignty
08:56 -  and what he chooses is to begin to understand God. See what I mean?
09:02 -  And that he chose Israel is perfectly in keeping with what he is as God.
09:08 -  All the more that he not only knows them perfectly through and through,
09:14 -  but he foreknew them and still made them
09:20 -  the object of his love and of his choosing. Because he purposed
09:26 -  in his heart to exhibit in and through them
09:32 -  not only his severity. Notice the language here. Holy severity.
09:38 -  See the way that woman brooded over every word. Would you ever thought that severity
09:44 -  is holy? Give me a synonym for severity. What would be an
09:50 -  expression or an example biblically of severity in God? One word. It begins with a J.
09:56 -  Judgment. Is judgment holy? Wrestling
10:02 -  is holy. But is judgment holy? If it comes from God,
10:08 -  whether it's severe or grace, it's holy. And until it's holy for us,
10:14 -  we have not surrendered to God as Judge. And it's the omission of God as Judge
10:20 -  that leaves us with a warped, inadequate, and distorted view of God. He's a seamless garment.
10:26 -  He's indivisible. I can't presume upon you guys that you follow me in every word.
10:32 -  That means he cannot be divided. We like to put in categories. And we like this category like that.
10:38 -  He cannot be divided. If you exclude his judgment, you no longer have God.
10:44 -  You've got a warped distortion, a projection of your own imagining, you're deceived.
10:50 -  His judgments are holy. Judgments are holy. And unless you understand that,
10:56 -  you'll not appreciate his holy mercy that issues out of the same great heart. So no matter that
11:02 -  he knew them and all their many sins, and they are grievous.
11:08 -  My God, you shudder when you read the roll call of Israel's sins. Apostasy, abominations,
11:14 -  in the House of God and in the Temple of God. Sacrifices to false Gods
11:20 -  and in the very holy courts performed by priests and false prophets.
11:26 -  You would think, away with this people murmuring from the very beginning of their coming out of Egypt.
11:32 -  They were stiff-necked as your fathers were, so are you also from the beginning.
11:38 -  Nevertheless, he has not cast them off. Though he knew that and though he foreknew that,
11:44 -  he still put this in his heart to exude it in and through them. All the more are they
11:50 -  the witness of God, not because of their success but because of their failure.
11:56 -  What more shows the mercy of God? Some people that he passed on the back because they're successful
12:02 -  or some people that he restores not because of their virtue or their accomplishment but in the absence of it
12:08 -  because he is God. Because he's merciful. And we're going to see that.
12:14 -  We're starting with exile but we're going to end with restoration. And we're going to see that in the restoration of Israel it has not a cotton-picking
12:20 -  thing to do with any virtue of Israel. He forgives their sins in a day.
12:26 -  He restores them independent even of their repentance. Their repentance
12:32 -  follows their restoration, does not precede it. He expects nothing from them.
12:38 -  Our new covenant I will make with you not like the one that you broke but I'll write my law in your inward parts
12:44 -  and I'll put it in your heart. You cannot help but obey it because I'm going to give you that capacity.
12:50 -  It'll be an everlasting covenant because you'll never again break it because it has nothing to do with your ability to keep it.
12:56 -  I'll keep it through you. I'll give you that kind of a heart, I'll give you a new heart, new spirit. I mean we don't even have the Holy Ghost
13:04 -  we don't even know what mercy is what his goodness is until we shall see it explicated
13:10 -  and demonstrated in a nation and done so before the face of all nations.
13:16 -  This is God's final statement that concludes human history.
13:22 -  And any nation that does not surrender to that testimony and that revelation invites the judgment of God.
13:28 -  What more can he do? So Israel is chosen and you know what Jews even say, who asked for it?
13:38 -  What has it meant for us? Nothing but surus, trouble and that's true
13:44 -  severity because he's a holy God and your sins and
13:50 -  their backslides cannot go unacknowledged and dealt with. They must be required, they must be met
13:56 -  in judgment. So he's not a soft touch. Even then he shows his character.
14:04 -  We want to know what fatherhood is and how desperate we are for that model. So not only is
14:10 -  Holy Spirit but even in a more wonderful way is infinite grace and greatness.
14:16 -  What's the name of the movie called for infinite? Unending.
14:22 -  Endless. Cannot be exhausted. No matter how great his sins and backslides
14:28 -  his grace is infinitely greater. And when God says to us
14:34 -  you shall be holy as your father in heaven is holy, what have you thought about? That our
14:40 -  graciousness and goodness should be like his. And what a short fuse we have
14:46 -  with each other. One wrong look one wrong word, boom
14:52 -  the relationship is over. We're injured. We take our toys and go home. Where is
14:58 -  our infinite grace and goodness if we're to be like him? And how would we know
15:04 -  what the model is except that it was set before our eyes by the demonstration of it
15:10 -  with an entire nation totally undeserved of any expression of it?
15:16 -  Got the picture? And all the attributes of his
15:24 -  character. Not just his goodness and grace but all the attributes.
15:30 -  Israel is so vexing and so all demanding that
15:36 -  it calls out and calls for every attribute of the divine
15:42 -  nature. It saves us from speculation. We see
15:48 -  the actual demonstration of it in his dealings with his people and especially in
15:54 -  crisis and severity. The last days dealings of God with Israel in expulsion
16:00 -  and exile and restoration and return will reveal all of his
16:06 -  character, all of the attributes of his character to what end for the blessing of
16:12 -  all the nations of the earth. If this is true
16:18 -  and the church is ignorant or indifferent to this mystery how is it the church?
16:26 -  I don't give a rap how good its services are, its progress.
16:32 -  If this is absent from the consideration of that church if they do not understand this
16:38 -  as being central to God's last days demonstration of himself how is it the church?
16:44 -  All the more when the demonstration of his attributes and his infinite grace is not
16:50 -  abstractly out of the air but through the church itself in its own conduct
16:56 -  toward Israel. We're going to be talking about that.
17:02 -  The demonstration of himself will come through the church that shares his character and nature
17:08 -  in last days extremity and that they can perform this
17:14 -  without even being aware that they're performing a function. Israel has no
17:20 -  cognizance whatsoever of its destiny and its cause and that it's serving these purposes and yet it is.
17:28 -  How much more will we serve than out of an awareness and a yieldedness
17:34 -  to the purposes of God? That we are privileged people, that we can be conscious
17:40 -  of God's purpose and give ourselves to it in the surrender. They got performing it
17:46 -  in their ignorance. Critical version Deuteronomy 32
17:52 -  Let's look at it. We have to be nation conscious kingdom conscious
18:02 -  millennium conscious has everything to do with the nations. The whole issue of the
18:08 -  nations and Israel as a nation is at the heart of the whole matter and that's why the powers of darkness
18:16 -  rail against Israel coming through because the destiny of nations are at stake
18:22 -  which have been their playground. The rulers of this world, the kings and the
18:30 -  rulers, the kings are the visible earthly authority but the
18:36 -  rulers are the invisible spectral spirit entities that ruled all of
18:42 -  those nations and influenced and performed their will through the earthly kings.
18:48 -  Now we'll come into this I don't want to flood you out on the first day but the cosmic
18:54 -  context of this drama Mamma Mia! This is a
19:00 -  cosmic struggle between the powers of light and of darkness
19:06 -  between value systems between kingdoms over the issue of the
19:12 -  nations. Deuteronomy 32 verse 8
19:18 -  When the most high divided to the nations their inheritance
19:24 -  when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
19:30 -  according to the number of the children of Israel. For the Lord's portion is his people
19:36 -  Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. I have never heard those verses
19:42 -  explicated or executed or spoken in a sermon and I messed up
19:48 -  there's something there rude over that there's
19:54 -  something that you want to go word for word and rude over that statement
20:00 -  word for word because it shows a stratagem of God from the very
20:06 -  inception of his creation that makes the existence of Israel central
20:12 -  to the nations. Makes even the number of the nations related to the number
20:18 -  of the sons of Israel. There's something about Israel and the nations that
20:24 -  we must simply understand in the economy of God that the very number
20:30 -  of them in God's genius is related somehow to Israel
20:36 -  and indeed when his kingdom comes through a restored Israel
20:42 -  the government of God comes out of that restored nation to the nations
20:48 -  and what is Israel's first call that God says is the gift and calling of Israel
20:54 -  that is without repentance or irrevocable. What is Israel's essential call?
21:00 -  A nation of priests and a light unto the
21:06 -  world. I don't know. I want to plant a stake. I want to sink
21:14 -  a stake. And we're not just playing around with tiddlywinks.
21:20 -  This is why all hell shall be ventilated against Israel in the last days and
21:26 -  already hated by all nations. In Zechariah it says in chapter 12
21:32 -  all nations will come against Jerusalem to destroy it. And who's clever
21:38 -  enough here at the table to understand what would be the underlying motivation of the hatred
21:44 -  of all nations for destruction? Why should they be so resentful of a
21:50 -  pitiful little nothing on the map of Beep nine miles wide? You can walk from one
21:56 -  end to the other in a day. Why should the great massive powers of the earth send their
22:02 -  armies to obliterate that little thing? They cannot stand its existence. Why? They don't like Jews?
22:08 -  They can't hate it. They can't hate it. They can't hate it.
22:14 -  They hate God. They hate God. But what is the animus? What is the vexation
22:20 -  for this hatred? It has to do with rule.
22:26 -  Rule and government that issues from this nation
22:32 -  to all the nations according to Deuteronomy 32 and other places in
22:38 -  scripture. When the restoration of Israel comes, the law of the Lord shall go forth
22:44 -  out of Geneva? New York UN headquarters?
22:50 -  Out of Zion! And the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. Now how do we know
22:56 -  that that's not a metaphor or a figure of speech or a spiritualized
23:02 -  element? Because God gets specific. He says when the nations hear it, they'll beat their
23:08 -  swords into powshires and their spears into pinworks and will study war no more.
23:14 -  In the last issue of Newsweek magazine, the United States is the leading
23:20 -  trader in armaments in the world. Fifty-five billion
23:26 -  dollars a year. The world economy is almost
23:32 -  predicated on weaponry. You imagine
23:38 -  casting that aside? What a crisis for any economy, for world economy.
23:44 -  But nations will beat their swords into powshires, they will study war no more, make no preparation for it.
23:50 -  It will no longer be a factor in their economy. Their whole mentality, their whole I mean, the most radical change.
23:56 -  Of all the things that God cites, that when the law goes forth out of Zion, the word of Lord Jerusalem, this is cited,
24:02 -  they'll study war no more. It has a practical, consequential effect on their economy,
24:08 -  their social life, their conduct, their constituency as nations. When?
24:14 -  When the law goes forth out of Zion and the word of Lord Jerusalem, which is located
24:20 -  where? In Israel. Do you understand that?
24:26 -  That's why all the nations come against Jerusalem to destroy it. Because this is a
24:32 -  throw away generation. If you want to remove the vexation, you divorce it.
24:38 -  You throw it away, or you abort it. You get it out of your sight
24:44 -  and out of your consideration, till it is no more. And that mentality, which is the wisdom of darkness,
24:50 -  shall be ventilated against Israel because God has chosen them.
24:56 -  Are these nations puppets to these principalities? Absolutely. And what happens when
25:02 -  Israel is restored and the king comes and has a sanctuary with them where it says in Zechariah,
25:08 -  for I have chosen Jerusalem. It's the end of the principalities and policies. They're
25:14 -  finished. Another kingdom has come and all authority is subjected under its feet.
25:20 -  This is the drama. This is the governmental context of the last days drama.
25:26 -  And we know from our own experience, try and get a politician out of office. These congressmen who have been
25:32 -  in for 30, 40 years, who have million dollar villas and retirement funds and every
25:38 -  benefit that they have accrued from their political role, try and get them out. My God, they'll be up kicking
25:44 -  and screaming and shrieking like nothing you've ever heard. Once you empower and enjoy the benefits
25:50 -  of power. Have you ever heard anyone voluntarily give it up? How much more the powers of
25:56 -  darkness who have had undiminished sway since the fall.
26:04 -  And though disarmed by Jesus at the cross, they have not been nullified. Their
26:10 -  final extinction comes in the drama of the last days with Israel and the church.
26:16 -  And though he has disarmed them, he has not removed them as an entity. They are still
26:22 -  effectual. And just to raise the most elementary question, when in recent history has
26:28 -  the demonstration of that power been so visibly set forth before our view
26:34 -  in actually taking over the entire apparatus of state in order to ventilate and
26:40 -  to express the demonic wisdom? Nazi? Germany?
26:46 -  You cannot understand Nazi Germany without taking into consideration the principalities and powers
26:52 -  of the era. Not content merely to influence, they took
26:58 -  full possession of a nation that yielded itself up to a complete dominance of those powers
27:04 -  because they had forfeited the faith through a innocuous
27:10 -  Lutheranism and left the vacuum that those powers exploited and possessed.
27:16 -  This is no small thing and Israel is hated and despised and its whole history
27:22 -  of near extermination can only be understood by the nations wanting to remove
27:28 -  Israel as a factor because they intuit the threat to themselves of the church is not stimulus.
27:36 -  We have got to bring the whole subject into the context that God himself gives it, which is governmental,
27:42 -  the issue of kingdom, issue of nations, issue of rule and then we're no longer talking
27:48 -  about court religious place but vital interest of men for which they will kill
27:54 -  and destroy and justify themselves in doing so. And we, when we
28:00 -  see this and come into the reality of this, how shall we be regarded by the principalities and powers of darkness?
28:10 -  We will begin to experience a degree of opposition that will be totally new for us
28:16 -  because now we constitute threat and it doesn't matter where you are
28:22 -  you don't have to be in a great center of world power. You can be a misper Minnesota or
28:28 -  Laporte, but they know whom to fear and whom to regard.
28:34 -  They're not at all impressed with the big showcases of modern Christendom and the flashing that they know
28:40 -  where the earnest issues are and who's alert to them and who is considered a threat.
28:48 -  And that's why I say nearly to have a sentimental interest in Israel and want to see her succeeds
28:54 -  in the coming is to miss the issue altogether. And you'll not understand
29:00 -  the hatred that will be poured out against Israel and might
29:06 -  yourself be taken in by the fire, unless you understand what is going on.
29:12 -  That's hatred. John asked me about any special assignments. Well, maybe as we go
29:20 -  along, I'll think of some. But right now, if anybody wants to take this up as a challenge
29:26 -  and exegete that statement in Deuteronomy verse 8 exegete means draw out the
29:32 -  meaning, ponder that and bring us like a one page report.
29:38 -  The shorter you can make your statement the more concise, the greater the development
29:44 -  of your own skill and ability by the Holy Ghost. But just to read that word for word,
29:52 -  when the Most High divided the nations the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof
29:58 -  and the nations and then nationhood is a divine
30:04 -  projection from heaven. It's not the autonomous, arbitrary
30:10 -  will of men. They may think so but it's God who established them else. Someone has said that when the
30:16 -  millennium comes, though we have now over two to three hundred nations in the world there will only be seventy.
30:22 -  God only intended seventy and will be restored to God's original intention because that's
30:28 -  in keeping with the sense. Interesting though, Jesus sent out his disciples, he sent out seventy. Something about that number
30:34 -  that shows again that this whole kingdom thing is the issue of nations.
30:40 -  I would say we loved him because he first loved us. Is it
30:46 -  gratitude for that love or because in loving us he imparts himself and
30:52 -  that ability that enables us to love him by the same power.
30:58 -  Here's an interesting little question. How much would you be willing to suffer
31:04 -  the reproach and the accusation of lovelessness until this love comes? Because
31:10 -  this can be substituted for there is a human love that is less than
31:16 -  other than that but which has certain impressive aspects romantic and
31:22 -  in fact I would say that even that love is a grace from God. I would not want to consider a world
31:28 -  in which there is an eradication or an absence of even human love because
31:34 -  it makes the world go round so to speak. It saves it from being more barbarous than it otherwise would.
31:40 -  But from the point of view of believers called to ultimate things for which human love would not be
31:46 -  sufficient, how many of us would be willing to go through a no man's land of the absence
31:52 -  of any love that we could ourselves have humanly provided in order to wait for this perfect thing?
31:58 -  It's ironic that how not only can the human love
32:06 -  be a substitute for the divine but actually an impediment to the coming of the divine.
32:12 -  If we want to hold the lesser thing, God will not force the perfect thing upon us. How many
32:18 -  souls are there that would be willing even to give up to the lesser thing in order to receive the greater?
32:24 -  And go through that period of death in which God would not immediately provide that in which you have to even taste
32:30 -  lovelessness and be accused of it and suffer the reproach of it. I think that God's question to Peter
32:36 -  was going to be God's question to the Church in the last days. Like when we're faced
32:42 -  with Israel in extremity because I'm literally expecting that the day will come. It will be the night
32:48 -  of Israel's severest crisis where
32:54 -  if God did not shorten it, no flesh could have survived. But broken streams of Jewish
33:00 -  humanity coming through this property and other properties like it, completely disheveled, unkempt,
33:06 -  disordered, disoriented, the suddenness of devastation has come upon that it will take them and they come in in that next
33:12 -  condition and need to be accommodated. I mean, Jews in that, you can imagine
33:18 -  that unless they're met by an unconditional love, we're going to miss the test. We're going to express our
33:24 -  own irritation, our own exasperation. There'll be two triangles. And so this is no small
33:30 -  thing that the least of the purposes of God is to bring a Church to
33:36 -  the place of His love in the last days. But if you can love Israel in her sin and
33:42 -  backsliding, then what can nations also hope for the same? What do you think of a
33:48 -  God who will go so far as to bring Israel through the most severe conditions
33:54 -  in order to reveal His attributes that they might bless all the nations? You call
34:00 -  that love? Israel wasn't even asked that they're
34:06 -  going to be the vehicle of the demonstration of Himself. You call that a loving God?
34:12 -  Is that fair? And how much would we suffer for the Lord to use us in that way where He doesn't explain it
34:18 -  in order that some aspect of His attributing character might be demonstrated?
34:24 -  And isn't it interesting that what consummates the end of the age and the coming of the
34:30 -  millennium is that the knowledge of God shall cover the earth as the waters come to the seas. Not what we
34:36 -  thought Him to be, which is so much the projection of our own subjectivity and desire, our own humanity,
34:42 -  which makes Him less than what He is, but the knowledge of God as He is in Himself.
34:50 -  That's the whole point and purpose of everything. That's what will bless the nations
34:56 -  and the revelation has got to come through His severity and grace of God,
35:02 -  His infinite grace through this one nation. What a drama! That's the drama
35:08 -  of the last days, the dealings of God in the last days, and the suddenness with which many of these
35:14 -  things will come and break. Israel's growing in crisis, the inability to solve it,
35:20 -  the necessity to make some kind of a negotiated peace with a world figure who can guarantee that peace,
35:26 -  who will then demand their worship in a restored temple in which they would walk, and then that
35:32 -  releases the anti-Christ persecution of Israel that drives the woman into the wilderness to escape
35:38 -  that persecution where a place has been prepared for her, where she might be fed for three and a half years.
35:44 -  The whole drama, we're at the verge of having that whole thing break and out of which
35:50 -  and by which, both in the crisis and in the return, I will bring them back one by one,
35:56 -  the lame, the whole, and I will restore them, give them a name and they will be my ministers
36:02 -  and they will be a crown and a diadem in my hand. This dishonored nation that has blasphemed
36:08 -  his name, all of this in the span of the very few last concluding years before
36:14 -  and culminating at the Lord's return is the whole drama of the last days and Israel is at
36:20 -  the heart of it. The greatest revelation of himself, both in the severity
36:26 -  and in the mercy. What are saints going through now?
36:32 -  Well, feelings and trials and upsets and
36:38 -  people who had their view all nicely worked out, having their whole apple-cut turned over and
36:44 -  unanticipated things happening like God has tightened the screws, dealing with his saints,
36:50 -  breaking into their categories, not content with shallow understandings, bringing them
36:56 -  into dimensions of experience through trial and suffering, but in order to establish
37:02 -  the knowledge of himself. It's quite an hour. I've been around for 30 years
37:08 -  and I said to someone yesterday, I've never seen God more earnest than I've seen him now, willing to go as far as he's willing to go
37:14 -  with saints, and if he's willing to bring Israel out again from the nation in which
37:20 -  they thought they had finally obtained their security and to cast them again into the nations as exiles
37:26 -  and without hope in terrible devastation and defeat and ruin, in order to bring them back
37:32 -  in the expression of his mercy, how far will he go with us? How many Christians are there who would give
37:38 -  him leave to take us even a portion of that way? Unless they understand
37:44 -  that the final issue is his glory forever. That's how Paul ends Romans 11,
37:50 -  for other than improvement through him, are all things to whom be glory forever.
37:56 -  And that is the apostolic distinctive. The church that is not jealous of the glory
38:02 -  of God forever will fail at this. They'll lose heart, they'll lose interest, they'll lose ability, they will not
38:08 -  be willing to be sifted and prepared by God for their participation. Only those whose foremost
38:14 -  motive is his glory will be able to bear it. And how to communicate that
38:20 -  and to engender that, I don't know. But maybe that's the prophetic task.
38:26 -  To call the church out of its own concern for itself, to be jealous for God's glory,
38:32 -  where they're not mindful of themselves and for themselves, is maybe the prophetic
38:38 -  task. And when the gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed to all nations,
38:44 -  then shall the end come. The church is still locked in its own concern for itself. It's still the object
38:50 -  of its own attention. Someone sent me a videotape. They're wanting to move from
38:56 -  where they are to the location of their churches. What did I think of the tape and the message? Well, it was the church
39:02 -  celebrating itself. You know, like, ain't we got fun? And what an enjoyment
39:08 -  to be the church and the body of Christ. Which is true. But that's not the end
39:14 -  of it. That's the means to the end. That's much greater than the church. And the church that does not
39:20 -  see that end and give itself for that end is not the church, however much it celebrates itself, and however much it
39:26 -  has principles of truth about the body of Christ. See what I mean? It's a terrible egocentrism.
39:32 -  And what saves us from it? Israel. And the issue of
39:38 -  this kingdom and its coming. You see what it... And Paul says in Romans 11,
39:44 -  how they say, some of them shall fall a bit, but through their false salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to
39:50 -  move them to jealousy. He gives at the very statement of the purpose for our salvation, something
39:56 -  beyond ourselves, and beyond ourselves, and other than ourselves, to move someone else to jealousy.
40:02 -  That our salvation is not for ourselves. It's a means to some other end. To communicate something for someone else who have been
40:08 -  the historic enemies of the Gospel till now. That's a saving grace for us.
40:14 -  Even in the Church we bring again the same egocentrism that we had in the world, now no longer over
40:20 -  carnality, but now over spirituality. Can you see it? You can become just as egotistical over being
40:26 -  spiritual as you were over being carnal. It's the subject of Israel that saves us from being
40:32 -  locked in and tied into ourselves. Well, Israel will take care of itself.
40:40 -  It's not even a fact that she's out of it. She will be acted upon. She'll not be an actor.
40:46 -  But the Church is the agent. The Church is the conscious instrument of God that can oppose
40:52 -  these views or yield and lend themselves to it. For another. For a nation that
40:58 -  is despised. And will the Church come through in that way?
41:04 -  And to Him be glory in the Church is really the question. I sometimes say that the Church
41:10 -  has got to be willing to play second fiddle. And your destiny is altogether related to being something
41:16 -  for someone else. And only in that do you come to the realization for yourself. It's the giving up and the losing
41:22 -  of your life and your identity. You are not the thing in yourself. You are a means to some other end. God's restoration of
41:28 -  Israel through you. Are you willing to play second fiddle? Well, look at the story of the prodigal son
41:34 -  and how the elder brother resented the return. And didn't want to enter into that joy and into that celebration.
41:40 -  You never did this for me. How come? And he wasted all of his substance. That's a powerful
41:46 -  what's the word? No, what's the story?
41:52 -  Parable. It's a powerful parable for the last days.
41:58 -  And the question is, will the Church exhibit the older son's attitude? Or will they
42:04 -  share the father's heart and rejoice for the return of that son? And not feel like they've been neglected and he's getting
42:10 -  all the attention. Because what does Jesus say? What does the father say to the older son? But everything I've had has always
42:16 -  been yours. Didn't you know it? And the fact is that most of us don't.
42:22 -  We have inferior feelings and inadequate feelings. And when that
42:28 -  conscious that we're accepted in the Beloved and therefore it shows in our lack of grace toward them.
42:34 -  Why should they? We're not rooted and established in the love of God who has
42:40 -  given us all things. And it's on that basis that Jesus was able to wash the feet of his disciples. Knowing he had
42:46 -  come from the father, he was going to the father, and that the father had given him all things, he could take off his robe.
42:52 -  He could gird himself with a towel. He could wash their feet. Because he was released
42:58 -  for that humility, knowing that he knew that he knew his place in the father. So the whole issue
43:04 -  of Israel requires us to understand whether we are in that place
43:10 -  or not. And most of us are not in that place. And to come to that place and then we can welcome
43:16 -  the return of the part of the son with joy. But not to end on a note that we're playing second fiddle. We also
43:22 -  have the greater reward. Israel is a restored nation in the Earth which is a great honor and
43:28 -  distinction. They will be priest unto God from the earthly level. But what is our reward?
43:34 -  Heavenly, eternal, glorified bodies ruling and reigning with Christ, ascending and descending upon
43:40 -  the son of man. We eclipse the glory that is even bestowed upon Israel. So we're not going to come
43:46 -  out on the short end. Who can answer this final question for the morning? To what would we attribute
43:52 -  the absence of this kind of understanding in the Church today?
43:58 -  And what would be required to restore it? Whose
44:04 -  function is that? If the Church is lacking the views that we have discussed this morning, and I believe that's true
44:10 -  that essentially it does, how come? Why is this absent from the Church's consideration? And
44:16 -  what will it take to restore it? Whose responsibility of all of the callings in God,
44:22 -  which calling is appointed for the restoration of these views?
44:28 -  The prophetic. The prophetic. That's why we call this little thing
44:34 -  The School of the Prophets. Maybe we're not all called per se, but we're
44:40 -  called in one way or the other, either pray for that restoration, to encourage that restoration, or as churchmen, to recognize
44:46 -  how central that is to God's whole program, and to welcome that restoration, as I was
44:52 -  discussing with a pastor locally the other day, my general experience over the years is a fear
44:58 -  and a defensiveness against the coming of a prophetic man
45:04 -  into the Church. They are fearful and intimidated and threatened, and yet it is God's
45:10 -  life-saving propensity to restore what has been so lost. And with what kind of sensitivity then
45:16 -  must the message bearer come? Knowing this kind of historic fear,
45:22 -  even among, in the Church itself, and the fact that there's been a historic parenthesis in
45:28 -  which prophets have been absent, and that the word prophetic even conjures up a sense of something bizarre and
45:34 -  fluky, and some character who's going to rock the joint. You see how, what is that?
45:40 -  Sensitive, profound problem. So we need, like God, not only do we have the message,
45:46 -  but also the character that will enable that message to be brought
45:52 -  to those who are reluctant and unwilling even to hear it in fear, that will rock their established
45:58 -  Church, the German situation. And so part of our task is how do we minister
46:04 -  to the fearful, to the anxious, to the undiscerning, in a way in which they can hear
46:10 -  and receive such a word? That's a real task, and the emphasis
46:18 -  is on our character, especially if we are resisted or rejected. How do we
46:24 -  respond to rejection? Well, if that's the way you're going to be, then tough on you. You had your
46:30 -  chance. It's going to take something, but it's critical.
46:36 -  And that's why God's dealings with prophets is so severe. They've got to be winnowed and
46:42 -  sifted and divested of any kind of defensiveness, subjectivity, hurt feeling
46:48 -  where they would react in the defensiveness for themselves, a kind of selflessness.
46:54 -  And maybe that's why, what does it say? The testimony of Jesus as the
47:00 -  spirit of prophecy is such a conjunction between the prophetic call and the character and
47:06 -  the nature of the Lord himself. That's why we'll not obtain it in three weeks here, but
47:12 -  there's a lifetime of shaping that we can yield ourselves and welcome it when we see
47:18 -  what's at stake. Hallelujah. Lord, thank you for a productive morning, my God,
47:24 -  for parting the waters, allowing us to get our feet in and almost in an encyclopedic
47:30 -  way, Lord, you've spread such a canvas before us, such a multitude of
47:36 -  things, the richness of the issues that are involved in what is required and the shortness of the time in which
47:42 -  it's going to be attained in these last days and crisis already at the door, Israel's expulsion
47:48 -  waiting just momentarily for new release and a church totally unprepared for these eventualities.
47:54 -  And so, Lord, we're asking grace for our understanding and for the character
48:00 -  that must accompany that understanding if it's to be communicated to your people that they might receive it.
48:06 -  Lord, we need your blessing even to proceed from here, to enter into these things
48:12 -  and to be affected and shaped by them. Receive our gratitude this morning. Be with us in our thoughts
48:18 -  through the day, the night hours, in our prayers, seeing, my God, how momentous a thing we're about.
48:24 -  This is not just a summer diversion for a few weeks. We're on tremendous ground here.
48:30 -  The stakes are enormous, Lord, and what are we but frail pieces of humanity? And so we ask your blessing
48:36 -  and even the spirit of prayer to draw out of your heart, my God, your burden in these days.
48:42 -  This might be historic and have an implication, a consequence far beyond us. Thank you.
48:48 -  Put a seal on this much, Lord, and sift it, and sift us through it, we pray,
48:54 -  receiving our gratitude in Jesus' name. Amen.
