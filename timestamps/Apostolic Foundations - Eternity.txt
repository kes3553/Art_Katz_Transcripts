Apostolic Foundations - Eternity

00:00 -  How many are here tonight who were not here last night? Can you just raise your hand? All right, thank you. If it's possible for you to get the tape of last night, I think that that might be helpful.
00:23 -  I'll be probably making some references to it in tonight's talk. It's the event of Paul at Mars Hill on Chapter 17 in the Book of Acts. And tonight we have a formidable task.
00:52 -  And that is to speak to the subject of eternity. It's not something that I've chosen because it sounds clever. It's just on the Lord's program for tonight.
01:08 -  It's something that mortal lips should not attempt to discuss. And it's probably a statement of the whole paradox of the Church. And it's probably a statement of the whole paradox of the Church.
01:29 -  Christ in us, the hope of glory. Heavenly things through earthly vessels. So I'm going to pray for a heavenly assist.
01:44 -  So I'm going to pray for the Lord to assist us divinely. My brother Andrew has been traveling all through the day to get here and is tired. I've had a day's rest and preparation before the Lord and I'm still tired.
02:07 -  And maybe that's what it takes. And maybe that's what it takes. A diminishing of men.
02:15 -  We must decrease if he is to increase. So I'm trusting for that. If you think that the subject is irrelevant.
02:30 -  And what has this to do with apostolic foundations? The answer is everything. This is the foundational thing.
02:44 -  Not church government and order. Various other of the practicalities of church life. The foundation of the apostolic view.
03:03 -  It is a true apprehension of the things that are eternal. Not in anticipation of a future enjoyment. But of a present appropriation.
03:23 -  That's what makes us peculiar. We're in time but we're beyond time. In the world but not of it.
03:37 -  A heavenly people. Who happen also to be Swiss. Or Jewish.
03:50 -  So I'm going to pray that either the Lord comes down. Or we ascend up. But somewhere somehow in these days.
04:04 -  Eternity must come into time. The holy into the profane. That's what makes the church a glory.
04:20 -  And a witness unto him. Let's pray for this. Precious God.
04:30 -  The living God. That means you're available right now. And Lord Andrew and I are so conscious of our need.
04:42 -  You've given us a topic so beyond any human ability to convey. We just want to together fall into your arms. In a precious Sabbath relaxation.
05:02 -  And let you convey your own thoughts to this people. Not only are you the only one who's qualified. You're the only one who is entitled.
05:18 -  To speak of so heavenly a thing. So speak tonight. That we might be permanently made heavenly minded.
05:32 -  Which is to say apostolic. For Jesus sake we ask it. In his name we pray.
05:43 -  Amen. There are so many scriptures but just for a place of beginning 2 Corinthians the fourth chapter. I hope that from tonight on you'll be continually stumbling into this word.
06:13 -  Somehow though it was there you had never properly noticed it before. You thought it was just a kind of biblical rhetoric a certain nuance of expression. You didn't think that the apostolic writers really meant it.
06:38 -  You thought it was just a style or a flourish. You have no idea how important. To lose the meaning of this word is to lose all.
06:56 -  It is to lose everything. It is to condemn the church to being mundane and ordinary. Institutional and mechanical.
07:13 -  A weariness of the flesh. Instead of a joy and a power. We are going to have to contend for this word.
07:26 -  I've had personally to contend for it today. Almost to block my door to keep anyone from entering. In all of the normal kinds of interruptions that happen in the world.
07:46 -  Do you want lunch? Do you want dinner? This, that. Eternity needs to be contended for. Eternity is something that needs to be fought for.
08:03 -  Because the world is not hospitable to it. Paul not only found this eternal dimension. He dwelt in it.
08:17 -  And did that condemn him to irrelevancy? To condemn him to never be out of contact with the reality of the world? On the contrary.
08:33 -  On the contrary, it made him all the more relevant. And so will it make us also. The verse 16 of this chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians.
08:53 -  Paul speaks of the fact that we must not lose courage. Because the outer man is destroyed, but the inner man is renewed day by day. Because a moment of slight affliction produces for us, beyond all measure, an eternal weight of glory.
09:09 -  Also, we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. And just ignoring the 5th chapter heading,
09:29 -  for we know that if this earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
09:41 -  3 successive verses and 3 references to the word eternal. Even an eternal weight of glory, we must not lose courage.
09:57 -  Because the things which are seen, beyond all measure, are temporal, an eternal weight of glory.
10:09 -  This is beyond poetry. This is something that has become so powerfully real to Paul that it affects his present considerations.
10:27 -  This is the man who is beaten with rods and with many strokes, left for dead, in hungers and buffettings and no certain dwelling place, naked,
10:43 -  reviled, persecuted, defamed, made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things even unto this day.
10:59 -  And this is a very brief statement. Paul does not dwell on his sufferings. He dismisses them as being momentary and light.
11:17 -  Only on the basis of one thing, the ability to glimpse the eternal weight of glory. This is not a luxury that we can consider having or not having.
11:37 -  This is an utter apostolic requirement. For an apostolic determination will bring us to apostolic suffering. The fact that we have not yet experienced it
11:55 -  indicates where we have been till now. Some lesser kind of faith that has not excited the world against us. But an apostolic course will.
12:15 -  But an apostolic course will. What is God's provision for bearing the things that must come? Looking upon the things that are eternal.
12:41 -  The things that are not seen, the things that are invisible. Seeing the eternal weight of glory. The issue of seeing is all.
12:57 -  And I know it's going to take a conscious and concerted effort to bring us to this kind of seeing. And I know it's going to take a conscious and concerted effort
13:07 -  to bring us to this kind of seeing. Everything presently conspires against it. The world wants to fill our eyes with all of its voluptuous images.
13:23 -  The world wants to fill our eyes with all of its voluptuous images. Everything is clamoring for the attention of our senses. We are continually bidden to look down upon things.
13:43 -  It takes an apostolic determination to break that. To close out the things that are visible. To focus upon and dwell upon the things that are invisible and eternal.
13:59 -  It will produce a remarkable thing in you. It will produce a remarkable thing in you. A growing indifference to the things that are of the world.
14:11 -  But this is a faith, a mode of life that must be contended for. But this is a faith, a mode of life that must be contended for. We need to adjust our whole mindset and attitude.
14:23 -  We need to adjust our whole mindset and attitude. It's not that we have not believed in eternity. It's not that we have not believed in eternity.
14:35 -  But it's that we have agreed with the world that it does not become relevant until after this life. But it's that we have agreed with the world that this eternity becomes something real and relevant to our lives only after death.
14:45 -  It becomes applicable when this life has ended. It becomes applicable when this life has ended. So long as you have that attitude,
14:59 -  you will not be found disagreeable nor controversial. If you can relegate eternity to some future consideration, if you can relegate eternity to some future consideration,
15:11 -  if you can relegate eternity to some future consideration, if you can relegate eternity to some future consideration, then you are safe.
15:23 -  But God has called us to an apostolic task, to bring eternity into time. The book of Revelation begins by John speaking of the things which shall shortly come to pass.
15:35 -  The book of Revelation begins by John speaking of the things which shall shortly come to pass. There's a certain immediacy and urgency in this kind of apostolic writing. There's a certain immediacy and urgency in this kind of apostolic writing.
15:49 -  And yet it's 2,000 years later and it has not happened. And yet it's 2,000 years later and it has not happened. Was he deceived in error?
16:01 -  Not at all. He used the French N K에서 to use the French N K 24.
16:13 -  And in the end, he,​ we need to develop a sense for the things which are new to the Japanese culture.
16:25 -  The things that are imminent and about to break into time. The appearing of the Lord.
16:35 -  The apocalyptic conclusion of the ages. The issue is not the issue of chronology. The issue is the issue of expectation.
16:49 -  Of apostolic mindset. Perspective of seeing. The end result of which will be whether we have a
16:59 -  casual attitude. Come to our meetings with a kind of an air of indifference.
17:11 -  Or whether our meetings will be characterized by a spirit of urgency. I'm counseling believers to
17:21 -  steep themselves in the apostolic scriptures. We need to move and to live and have our
17:33 -  being as it were in them. Because in them are the things which are timeless and eternal.
17:47 -  That spirit of urgency and utter reality and consequence. This has got to be the normative
17:57 -  atmosphere in which we live our lives. Do we inhabit that world? The world that is presented to us in the scriptures?
18:13 -  Is that our real world? Or is that just the world into which we slip for our Bible studies?
18:25 -  Or our sermonizing? I'll tell you what will happen if you make this your real world.
18:35 -  You will become strange. A somewhat peculiar to those who are outside of you.
18:45 -  You are not excited by the things that excite them. You somehow are continually looking upward. You see things that don't occupy their attention.
18:57 -  Even those who call themselves Christians. And are sincere. You become increasingly strange and a stranger.
19:11 -  A pilgrim and a sojourner in the world. Looking for a city not made with hands. This is not biblical poetry.
19:23 -  This is the normative intention of God for all true saints. This is foundational to the faith.
19:37 -  That we see ourselves as pilgrims. We are looking for something that is not yet in view. We are looking for something that is not yet in view.
19:49 -  We are looking for something that is not yet in view. But our very anticipation and looking will bring it. We are expecting apocalyptic ends.
20:09 -  And Paul says seeing these things what manner of men ought we to be? Looking for and hastening the day
20:15 -  of his appearance. I feel so inadequate in speaking this. I'm sure the people who have been traveling with me
20:29 -  are weary of hearing me say it. It must be declared to every Christian in the world
20:41 -  It must be declared to every Christian audience. The day of the Lord's appearing is not a fixed chronological event.
20:57 -  Does not take place of itself irrespective of our condition. It is our very condition that brings him.
21:07 -  It is our very condition that brings him. We can hasten the day of the Lord's appearing by being what manner of men we ought to be.
21:21 -  Seeking for and hastening the day of his appearing. I'm not speaking about some trifling point tonight. This is not some esoteric subject.
21:37 -  This is utter reality. The issue of eternity is the issue of his coming.
21:47 -  And the issue of his coming by so much as one day sooner. Because of our apostolic preparedness. Because of the expectancy
21:59 -  that characterizes us. Means that many fewer rapes. Violence, bloodshed.
22:11 -  Destruction in the earth. He's coming to judge the earth. And this is what I spoke last night.
22:21 -  Paul speaking to the Greek philosophers on Mars Hill. Making no apology. Not at all embarrassed to step from philosophy
22:33 -  to theology in the same breath. For him it was not a matter of going from the secular to the sacred. It's all sacred.
22:45 -  All eternal. All heavenly. All real.
22:53 -  God has appointed a day in which he will judge all nations by him whom he has raised from the dead.
23:07 -  A day of judgment. God as judge. And therefore though he has winked in times past.
23:23 -  He now commands all men everywhere to repent. No apologies for introducing the subject of judgment. Or of Jesus or of the resurrection.
23:41 -  It was as natural to Paul as breathing. It didn't require elaborate introduction. These are not just religious thoughts.
23:57 -  They are the very foundations of all reality. Paul dwelt in this eternal dimension. And brought it to bear upon all of his earthly considerations.
24:15 -  Because eternity is the issue of heaven or hell. And we are going to be remarkably ill equipped to speak of either.
24:33 -  Unless the consciousness of eternity affects every waking hour. It's remarkable but if you squint your eyes
24:43 -  just a little. You sense the massive deception in which the whole world is lying.
25:01 -  I see it especially in my own Jewish people. Brilliantly intellectual. Remarkable in the careers and the professions.
25:13 -  From atomic physics to computers. Sociologists, historians, businessmen, financiers. But they are completely mindless
25:27 -  with regard to eternity. It is a category that has no weight for them. It is a vapor, an idle thing.
25:45 -  They are a statement of utter and ultimate deception. They are a statement of utter and ultimate deception. On Mars Hill, Paul told the philosophers
26:01 -  what the purpose of human existence is. God has made of one blood all manner of men.
26:15 -  And he has established the bounds of their habitations. Nations and governments and all of these complexities of economy and life.
26:23 -  In order that they might seek after him if happily they might be found of him.
26:35 -  How embarrassing. How simplistic. How intellectually dull.
26:47 -  It is simply simple. Dull. Is that it?
26:59 -  That's the whole purpose of our human existence? Surely that's all right for our Sunday consideration. Paul says no, it's God's intention
27:11 -  for all our consideration. It is the very purpose of all our being. It is the very purpose of all our being.
27:23 -  The issue that in this lifetime we are to establish that relationship with him that will affect all eternity.
27:37 -  Why don't we speak with that same simplicity? That same urgency. That same absoluteness.
27:49 -  Because we do not believe it as absolutely as he. And we do not live as if we believe it.
27:59 -  We are simply not that occupied with the things that are eternal. And therefore unable to persuade men.
28:13 -  We are... We need to press mankind to come to terms with eternity.
28:23 -  With the eternal. The least of things that they'll say to us is we're dogmatic.
28:37 -  Marrow-minded. Bigoted. Bigot.
28:43 -  Intolerant. So narrow. And that will be enough to intimidate
28:49 -  many of us to silence. For what is more embarrassing and more intimidating to a modern Christian
28:59 -  than to be considered narrow? Dogmatic. That does not intimidate Paul.
29:15 -  Eternity is not a narrow concept. It is as infinite and as timeless as hell. We had a little amusing incident
29:31 -  when we had to change planes at Zurich to fly to Geneva. And when we got on that little bus
29:37 -  that takes you out to the airplane. I forgot what chorus it was. What someone started.
29:47 -  What was that chorus you were singing? Walking in the light. Walking in the light?
29:53 -  Or with a mighty God we serve? We just began to sing and to chant and clap hands on the bus.
29:59 -  We began to sing and to chant and clap hands on the bus. Walking in the light.
30:07 -  Walking in the light. Walking in the light. Walking in the light of God.
30:15 -  Hallelujah. And I just saw the expressions on the face of these very polite
30:21 -  and sophisticated Swiss. With their exquisitely knotted cravats. And vested suits.
30:37 -  Umbrella on their arm. Looking at these peculiar Americans. What do you say in French? Gauche?
30:49 -  A bad taste. That sort of thing ought to be reserved for within the walls of the church.
30:59 -  How dare you disturb our serenity by this kind of simple ballad? How dare you to disturb our serenity
31:05 -  by such a simple song? They need to be more disturbed by a people who can not contain themselves.
31:11 -  By a people who can not contain themselves. Who are beyond the issue of taste and politeness in good manner.
31:19 -  Who are beyond the issue of taste and politeness in good manner. Who burn with the reality
31:25 -  of the truth and the truth. Who burn with the reality of the eternity. Who burn with the reality of the eternity.
31:31 -  And would take every opportunity to express the things that are divine. And would take every opportunity
31:37 -  to express the things that are divine. And bring them into the secular. And bring them into the secular.
31:43 -  This business of politeness and good taste is devilish.
31:49 -  This question of politeness and good taste is something diabolical. We need to see it as Paul would see it.
31:55 -  We had some discussions in America on what they call chemical dependency.
32:01 -  We had some discussions in America on what we call chemical addiction.
32:07 -  It's euphemism for drug addiction. It's euphemism for drug addiction. It's euphemism for drug addiction.
32:15 -  Isn't it just like the world to find a nice sounding word to disguise the horror of something
32:21 -  and to make its affect less? Isn't it just like the world to find a nice sounding word to describe the horror of something
32:27 -  to describe the horror of something that is in the world in its very nature? that is in the world in its very nature?
32:33 -  So a band of us from our community attended the public discussion. So we decided to let
32:39 -  that fall from our public discussion. Very polite, very rational, very secular.
32:45 -  We remained very polite, very rational, very secular. What kind of program shall be established for those poor victims of drugs?
32:51 -  What kind of program shall be established for those poor victims of drugs? The criminals now are victims
32:57 -  and the drug addicts are victims. The criminals now are victims and the drug addicts are victims.
33:03 -  We've become so psychological and sociological. We've become so psychological and sociological.
33:09 -  Whatever happened to sin? Whatever happened to sin? And two or three of our people
33:15 -  had been through drugs and were miraculously delivered. And two or three of our people
33:21 -  had been through drugs and were miraculously delivered. Out of psychiatric wards.
33:27 -  And they gave their testimony in the course of that evening. And they gave their testimony
33:33 -  in the course of that evening. And people so much as said, well that's nice for you.
33:39 -  Let's now go back to our discussion. And something was beginning to well up in my spirit.
33:45 -  And something was beginning and the end of the night I had to speak it. And the end of the night I had to speak it.
33:51 -  And I told them that if they're unwilling to recognize what is the unseen but true foundation
33:57 -  of all reality, namely the realm of the spirit world namely the realm of the spirit world
34:07 -  namely the realm of the spirit world demonism and Satanism demonism and Satanism
34:15 -  if they will not recognize this if they will not recognize this I think that they're only dealing with
34:21 -  a sociological phenomenon they seek in vain they seek in vain
34:31 -  they themselves are escapists they themselves are escapists and are willing to face
34:37 -  through reality and are willing to face through reality
34:43 -  and are guilty of the same fault that leads young people to take drugs it was a remarkable experience for us
34:51 -  it was a remarkable experience for us because at the very mention of God because at the very mention of God
34:57 -  Spirit World demons and introducing this entire dimension
35:03 -  and introducing this entire dimension the whole room seemed to shudder the whole room seemed to shudder
35:09 -  in the action and stiffen and stiffen
35:15 -  and recoil and recoil so much as to say
35:21 -  how dare you so much as to say how dare you
35:27 -  what bad taste what bad taste to bring your Sunday Christian concepts
35:33 -  into a secular discussion to bring your Sunday Christian concepts into a secular discussion
35:39 -  so unaccustomed were they so unaccustomed were they to any such penetration
35:45 -  so unaccustomed were they to any such penetration we have been guilt of keeping these issues
35:52 -  we have been guilt of keeping these issues of eternity to ourselves do we offer our views
36:00 -  do we offer our views as an opinion or a conviction is our point of view worth sharing
36:07 -  as an opinion or a conviction does this see them as absolute observation of life and death does this see them as absolute observation of life and death
36:25 -  this is the very height of offense to a world that is relativistic and pluralistic this is the very height of offense to a world that is relativistic and pluralistic they refuse to hear about something absolute
36:41 -  an absolute, eternal alternative an absolute, eternal alternative but they need to be told
36:53 -  not by people who bring the correct doctrine but who come with a burning conviction but who come with a burning conviction
37:05 -  believe that God has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness our apostolic task is to bring an unwanted and unwelcomed message to an indifferent world our apostolic task is to bring an unwanted and unwelcomed message to an indifferent world
37:29 -  but it's a message that we can only bring into the same proportion as we can demonstrate it but it's a message that we can only bring into the same proportion as we can demonstrate it it's not enough to be correct
37:43 -  we have to come to them as it were from the eternal place we have to come to them as it were from the eternal place you say but brother how can that be
37:57 -  I've not yet died that I could occupy eternity I've not yet died that I could occupy eternity well it's really interesting if you read the scriptures in which the references are made
38:11 -  you can take down these scripture references I don't have time to deal with them tonight but read them at your leisure you can take down these scripture references I don't have time to deal with them tonight but read them at your leisure
38:25 -  Romans 5.21 where Paul speaks of reigning by justice until eternal life he doesn't mean at some future time
38:37 -  he doesn't mean at some future time he means now he who hath the son hath life
38:49 -  eternal life the wages of sin is death Romans 6.23
38:59 -  but the free gift of God is eternal life now Galat 6.8
39:11 -  he who sows to the spirit shall from the spirit reap eternal life not just future but now Paul says to Timothy fight the good fight of faith
39:25 -  take hold of the eternal life to which you were called take hold of the eternal life to which you were called it's evident he's not speaking of some future thing
39:37 -  it's evident he's not speaking of some future thing now in 1 Timothy 6.12
39:47 -  Hebrews 5.9 having been made perfect he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation
39:59 -  that somehow there's a response to righteousness that somehow there's a response to righteousness there's a response to obedience
40:11 -  there's a response to obedience it's a salvation that has not to do with our eternal state it's a salvation that has not to do with our eternal state
40:23 -  but a source of salvation now something given by his life a particular kind of wisdom
40:35 -  an authority he's the source of eternal life for all those who obey him
40:47 -  he says that Jesus by the eternal spirit offered himself as a living sacrifice he didn't go to the cross in a human way as a political martyr he didn't go to the cross in a human way as a political martyr
41:05 -  he offered himself by the eternal spirit he offered himself by the eternal spirit the spirit which is available to us
41:15 -  the source of his life which is both eternal and abundant this is the record that God has given unto us eternal life
41:29 -  not will give, has given and this life is in his son he who hath the son hath life
41:41 -  maybe we can paraphrase it to say he who the son has, has his life eternity is not just endless time
41:55 -  eternity is not just endless time it is beyond time it's that place of timelessness
42:07 -  where as a thousand years and a thousand years is a day if you had the apostolic sight to see it now we are candidates tonight
42:21 -  to be in an eternal moment a certain kind of an event that God can give that transcends time
42:37 -  it's a particular quality of life Jesus said I give unto my sheep eternal life
42:49 -  and when many were turning from him he said to his disciples will you also depart from me and they said where shall we go
42:59 -  for you have presently and now for you have in the present
43:05 -  the words of I want to encourage your faith to eternity now
43:15 -  the bringing into our speaking now into our conduct now into our mindset and perception now
43:29 -  the things that are eternal you have the words of eternal life not the words about eternity
43:41 -  but the words from eternity eternity needs to be brought into time and there is only one agency by which that can happen
43:57 -  it's the church the believing church the apostolic church
44:05 -  that has its being and moves and lives in the eternal dimension now who abide in him
44:15 -  the high and lofty one who inhabits eternity whosoever believes in him
44:31 -  shall have eternal life not just future but now
44:39 -  it's a very peculiar state of being it's something like coming out of your seat to stand before an audience like tonight
44:53 -  knowing that God has appointed a subject that cannot be addressed in any kind of academic
44:59 -  or scholastic or mechanical way it's knowing that it's a call for something which is beyond that which is human
45:15 -  it's believing into him to have eternal life now to be in that dimension that is concurrent with time
45:31 -  it's a dimension that needs to be contended for if you will enter into life contend for the faith that was once given to the saints
45:43 -  it's more than just an injunction to embrace their doctrines it's an invitation to come into a certain dimension of being it's not going to make you ethereal and irrelevant
46:03 -  it's not going to make you ethereal and irrelevant it's not going to make you ethereal and irrelevant it's not going to make you ethereal and irrelevant
46:13 -  it's not going to make you ethereal and irrelevant you're not going to become dreamy and visionary for if eternity is anything
46:27 -  it is the very essence of that which is real it makes that which is visible and temporal it makes that which is visible and temporal
46:39 -  to become less substantial to you a certain rich young ruler came to Jesus and wanted to know how he could obtain eternal life
46:55 -  Jesus said keep the commandments and I think by that he didn't mean that your reward will be eternal life but that in the very keeping of the commandments
47:11 -  and that very obedience unto righteousness the eternal life is given if that will be perfect Jesus said
47:25 -  if that will enter into the kingdom are all responses to the man who said how may I obtain eternal life it's the issue of perfection in God
47:39 -  it's the issue of the kingdom come now in the earth as it is in heaven it's the issue of obeying the commandments Satan has been enjoying a holiday over the church for centuries
47:55 -  he's allowed us to fall into a sleep he's allowed us to fall into a sleep he's allowed us to fall into a sleep
48:05 -  he's allowed us to fall into a sleep by which we have dismissed or delegated eternity for some future time and it has robbed the church of its urgency
48:25 -  of its expectancy we need to taste the power now of the ages to come are we able to tell men that God has appointed a day in which he will judge all nations
48:47 -  it's the day of the Lord it's the day of the Lord a fearful day
49:01 -  who has the sense of this immanent judgment which is at the door who can speak it without fear of man only that one who fears God
49:21 -  and senses him already as present as the God who is judge our problem is that we secretly covet the world's admiration
49:47 -  we want to succeed on the world's terms if not academically, theologically we find ways to be polite
50:01 -  and to address our Christian convictions in ways in which the world can receive them we have lost the apostolic view we need to confront the world in its entire framework of thought
50:29 -  the whole of non-Christian thought is a lie for it has not reckoned on eternity it has not brought the invisible thing into its consideration
50:41 -  therefore all of its other considerations are askew or awry the world needs to be confronted with the things that are eternal confrontationally in love
51:07 -  as Paul himself confronted the Greeks but there is no assurance if you go up that kind of mountain that you will come down
51:23 -  you are striking at the very heart of the world and its lies men might stop their ears and rush upon you and gnash upon you with their teeth are we anxious to preach Christ and Him crucified
51:53 -  Christ risen and soon coming King and Judge we cannot divide these things
52:07 -  they are indivisible can you understand better why Paul said I am determined not to know anything
52:17 -  but Christ and Him crucified it takes a determination everything in the world and the flesh and the devil conspires against it
52:33 -  everything in the world and the flesh and the devil conspires against it it wants to diminish this truth it wants to put it in just the category of that which is religious
52:55 -  the doctrines that Christians choose to believe the doctrines that Christians choose to believe but we are called to preach this gospel to every creature
53:07 -  go ye into all the world and preach this gospel God has appointed a day in which He will judge all nations
53:23 -  by that one whom He has raised from the dead and I am just noticing how it is expressed in Act 1731 and I am just noticing how it is expressed in Act 1731
53:43 -  He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom He has appointed having furnished proof to all men
53:49 -  by raising him from the dead and it was the altar of righteousness by a man whom He has appointed
54:01 -  and has given to all men a proof of faith by raising him from the dead and I thought to myself, as I read this earlier today
54:13 -  how has He furnished proof to all men? When I thought about this, how did He give a proof of faith where the Englishman says a proof
54:23 -  for all men? That had to do with the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus?
54:37 -  How has He furnished proof to all men? By setting a pole before them who not only proclaims
54:51 -  the doctrine of resurrection and judgment but is a demonstration of the resurrection life
55:05 -  a taste of the power of the ages to come the issue of resurrection is already the issue of eternity
55:17 -  it's the life to come and when a man stands before unbelieving Greeks and speaks to them penetratingly out of that life
55:29 -  God has furnished proof to those men there's something wanting in us it's an entry into the eternal dimension
55:47 -  through the reality of resurrection life given to them who obey Him it's not enough to approve the doctrine
56:01 -  we need to live and move and have our being in Him or our words about an imminent judgment are without value
56:17 -  there can be no full preaching or speaking of the resurrection or of the eternal judgment
56:27 -  unless the entire framework of our life and our challenge is changed do we really want to see
56:41 -  all men everywhere to repent? because as they see the eternal judgment because as they see the eternity
56:53 -  that is already in us they will be eternally condemned except that they receive Him
57:07 -  in whose name we come we're moving to a final and ultimate confrontation we're approaching a final confrontation
57:19 -  with the philosophical spirit of the modern world it's not a place for politeness or relevance something raw, something timeless
57:31 -  and something eternal must be presented to men it's the very essence of that which is apostolic a church that has laid hold of that which is eternal
57:45 -  not just waiting some future state but already appropriating and bringing it into their present consideration
57:57 -  it's the very essence of that which is apostolic it's the very essence of that which is apostolic the issue of resurrection in us
58:13 -  is the issue of eternity for them God is wanting in an apostolic mindset these are the foundations of the church
58:33 -  not the issues of mechanics or church government however important that might be in itself a church without the eternal dimension
58:49 -  however correct it may be in every other form is not an apostolic church this is a position beyond correct doctrine
59:03 -  this is a position beyond correct doctrine something must come again into the atmosphere of God's corporate people a sense of urgency
59:23 -  that we cannot ourselves calculate or establish a sense of imminence things that shall shortly come to pass
59:37 -  the eternal sense of things the eternal stakes of heaven or hell by a people who know them
59:53 -  who already sense the eternal weight of glory which is so presently real to them now which is so presently real to them now
01:00:07 -  that the rejection that comes to them the abuse that comes to them the reproach that comes to them
01:00:19 -  the persecution that comes to them for the bearing of an unwelcome word that the world does not want to hear is for them only a momentary and a light affliction
01:00:33 -  is for them only a momentary and a light affliction seeing that which is invisible the eternal weight of glory
01:00:45 -  look up see apostolically God is wanting to restore at the very foundation of the church
01:00:59 -  the eternal view the eternal view I want to pray for that tonight
01:01:11 -  there is a mystery in these speakings this is not instructional this is not a matter of teachings
01:01:23 -  it's a word whose time has come the very speaking of which brings it something which needs profoundly to be restored
01:01:37 -  something which needs profoundly to be restored to save us from being fixed in time fixed in our culture
01:01:51 -  fixed in our secular categories to break through into another dimension to break through into another dimension
01:02:03 -  the reality truly is eternity now
01:02:11 -  let's pray heavenly father I call upon you in Jesus' name and I ask your mercy
01:02:29 -  and I ask your mercy look upon us Lord you know us everyone
01:02:37 -  we are utterly transparent in your sight you know how much our mind set and our thoughts have been affected by the world
01:02:53 -  something has been stolen from us something has been stolen from us we have never known it
01:03:01 -  I ask you to lift the veil tonight and to usher in a dimension of your glory to birth it into our very beings
01:03:15 -  that it might well up unto consciousness and save us from the fears and the intimidations of this present world that will change all our seeing
01:03:29 -  as we anticipate that which is soon to come as we anticipate that which is soon to come let it come now
01:03:41 -  a sense of that which is eternal beyond time glorious
01:03:49 -  a whole mode and dimension of being a whole mode and dimension of being as relevant now as it was 2,000 years ago
01:04:03 -  and it will be throughout all time world without end throughout all ages
01:04:13 -  eternity Lord breathe the spirit of your eternal the essence of your eternal spirit into us
01:04:27 -  may our eyes blink as it comes in may we emit a slight gasp as this intangible thing comes into our consciousness
01:04:49 -  as this intangible thing comes into our consciousness may it grow and abound may it become passionate and burning
01:05:01 -  may it become passionate and burning so that everything else is eclipsed our fears, our concerns, our anxieties
01:05:11 -  they are momentary and light as we see what is invisible and therefore eternally true
01:05:23 -  the greater weight of glory my God change us and lay this foundation in our corporate spirit and life
01:05:35 -  and lay this foundation in our corporate spirit and life that we might be an apostolic presence in the earth that we might be an apostolic presence in the earth
01:05:45 -  that we might be an apostolic presence in the earth beyond time and culture and therefore a challenge
01:05:57 -  to those who are blind and indifferent and who would otherwise perish
01:06:05 -  eternally give us such a sense of heaven that we can burn for the fear of hell
01:06:15 -  that we can burn for the fear of hell and persuade men before the soon coming day
01:06:27 -  of his appearing and the day of judgment which shall shortly come to pass
01:06:37 -  may we live as if we believe it in Jesus name and God's people said
