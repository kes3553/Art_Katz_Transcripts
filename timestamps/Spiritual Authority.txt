Spiritual Authority

00:00 -  My apologies for those who have heard me speak on Mark chapter 9 before. Sorry about that. But an inexhaustible and necessary classic text.
00:16 -  Another classicus textus. It's an end-time word, if ever there was. Took place in time, remember we talked about that?
00:26 -  Yet it's an episode calculated and given for our final and ultimate instruction. Mark chapter 9, beginning with the Mount of Transfiguration, but that's not our concern, except that it makes a kind of divine logic.
00:47 -  To begin with a transcendent mountaintop experience, and seeing the Lord transfigured, together with Moses and Elijah. What an experience.
01:00 -  Who can recover from that? You would think that you would carry the impressions to your grave, and that they would affect every subsequent thing,
01:09 -  once having had that kind of illumination. But isn't it like the Lord to go from the mountaintop to the valley, perfect in the wisdom of the Most High?
01:23 -  So it's the valley that we want to examine, because it's the valley toward which we are heading. This is our destiny.
01:30 -  The great climax of the age will not end on the mountaintop, it will end in the valley. But we've got to bring the mountaintop reality into the adverse condition
01:42 -  that meets us in that valley, which was the experience of the disciples in chapter 9. So when he came down, verse 14, he saw a great multitude about them,
01:56 -  the scribes questioning with them, and straight away all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed, and running to him, saluted him,
02:05 -  and he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? And one of the multitude answered and said,
02:12 -  Master, so you can see this guy's in trouble already, it's an inadequate greeting, it's an inadequate comprehension,
02:20 -  it's respectful, but it doesn't yet understand who it is who is being addressed. Master, I have brought unto you my son who hath a dumb spirit,
02:31 -  and wheresoever he taketh him the demon's spirit, he teareth him, and he foams and gnashes with his teeth and pines away. I spoke to your disciples, but that they should cast him out,
02:44 -  and they could not. He answered him and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?
02:51 -  How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me. It's one of the rare expressions of the Lord's exasperation at a failure that disappoints him,
03:03 -  that somehow he had every right to expect that the disciples should be able to cast out this spirit, and that perhaps even this father should have a better acknowledgement of himself,
03:16 -  faithless generation. And they brought him unto him, and when he saw him,
03:24 -  the evil spirit, straight away the spirit tore him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming. Jesus is calm as all get out,
03:35 -  not at all panicked or intimidated, said to the father, How long is it ago since this came unto him?
03:45 -  And he said of a child, My son has been experiencing this virtually from infancy, from the inception of his life.
03:55 -  The powers of darkness have been after him to harass, but not just to harass, but to destroy, for oftentimes it hath cast him, in verse 22, into the fire and into the waters.
04:08 -  Isn't that descriptive of the history of Israel? From its inception, from its birth, the powers of darkness are not content merely to harass,
04:17 -  they're out to destroy, in fire and persecutions and water and floods and all the kinds of things that they can wreak upon this people,
04:25 -  because they know that if this son ever comes to maturity, if this son ever comes to the fulfillment of the destiny of his call, these powers are once and for all,
04:36 -  and permanently and eternally finished. They are false usurping entities, who can only exist so long as the vacuum remains,
04:45 -  that only Israel can fulfill, and the church coming of age to occupy the vacancies, when they will be cast out in the last days.
04:55 -  So, this is more than just a demon spirit, a harassed son, this is symbolic,
05:03 -  this is a statement, this has an importance beyond the immediacy of this event. Can you see that?
05:14 -  I see it, I see it prophetically. I see, yes, it took place in time, it was only a son,
05:20 -  but when I read, how long has this been going on? Since of a child, since his inception, to harass in order to destroy,
05:27 -  and boing, I know exactly what that son represents, and what we need to understand, because we are going to be faced with exactly this situation.
05:39 -  Powers of darkness, knowing that their time is short, and acting out of their characteristic wisdom,
05:46 -  which destroys, because their God is a destroyer. He's a murderer,
05:56 -  and he's out to demolish the Jewish people. Came close, in the Hitler time, came close in the medieval history,
06:04 -  in which Jewish communities suffered massively. The Ukraine, the great pogroms, tens of thousands wiped out,
06:13 -  in weeks, months, of unrelenting terror. This force of darkness, has historically, since the inception of this child,
06:21 -  been out to destroy, what he knows better than the church, that if this child ever survives,
06:28 -  ever comes to maturity, ever comes into the fulfillment of his designated goal, we are once and for all finished.
06:36 -  For the kingdom that comes with them, displaces us forever. So the only answer then,
06:43 -  is to destroy, to remove, to annihilate. But if you can do anything,
06:50 -  have compassion on us and help us. Jesus said unto him, if you can believe,
06:56 -  all things are possible to him that believes. Straight away, the father of the child cried out and said with tears,
07:02 -  Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief. You have to help me.
07:06 -  I don't know, in this symbolic way in which I'm reading this, if the child represents the nation,
07:12 -  what does the father represent? In a partial and inadequate faith, who is also being confronted by the Lord
07:19 -  in the episode. So when Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit,
07:26 -  saying unto him, you dumb and deaf spirit, isn't that interesting?
07:31 -  You spirit that is keeping Israel from hearing, Shema YIsrael, Aranoi Elochad,
07:38 -  Aranoi Echad, hear O Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord.
07:42 -  Lord, we've not heard it. We recite it,
07:45 -  but we've not heard it. You know what I mean? It was given exactly that we would recognize
07:50 -  this one who comes and rightly deserves the worship of his people and the acknowledgement of himself as Lord.
07:59 -  Hear O Israel, why is that the great Shema that Israel is required to hear?
08:04 -  Because they would be confronted historically with one who comes that would be questionable
08:11 -  and contrary to expectation and would allow himself to be recognized by the doubting Thomas,
08:18 -  my Lord and my God. And so this deaf spirit keeps Israel from hearing
08:24 -  and the dumb spirit keeps Israel from speaking. For how then shall they be a nation of priests
08:29 -  and lighten to the world if they're silenced? This is no accidental
08:34 -  demonic phenomenon that has attacked this child, but calculated to negate, nullify
08:42 -  God's intention through him. But it's a deadly, powerful, last days entity
08:50 -  brought to a full fury and knowing, as I said, that its time is short
08:56 -  is wanting not just to harass but to destroy. That's what we're going to see.
09:01 -  We cannot understand the time of Jacob's trouble unless we understand
09:05 -  that this spirit is loose. This demonic fury is loose and it has already
09:11 -  such opportunity through an Islamic people worldwide who will yield to the press
09:17 -  of this spirit and be in agreement with it with such a zeal for the blood of Jews
09:22 -  as cannot be accounted for. That even the military historians of World War II
09:27 -  are perplexed to this day and cannot understand why at the very end of the war
09:33 -  German extremity they still continue to send material, manpower
09:38 -  and everything to the extermination camps that could have more readily been employed
09:44 -  in their own final defense. It doesn't make military sense. But until the last breath
09:50 -  they went on in the process of extermination with a fury that could not be requited
09:55 -  until it took every last Jew at their hands. That's the spirit.
10:00 -  And we're going to see it in full force in the last days. Terrifying.
10:05 -  It terrified and I think it intimidated the disciples. They could not cast it out.
10:10 -  And these are the same disciples that he sent out by tools and they came back with a report.
10:16 -  Even the demons are subject to us. He said, don't get carried away. Be rejoiced that your name is written
10:22 -  in the Lamb's Book of Life. But they came back excited. The demons.
10:25 -  Well, how come that they could cast those demons out and couldn't cast this one out?
10:31 -  Good question. And Jesus is going to answer it shortly. So, not only do I charge thee
10:40 -  to come out of him but enter into him no more ever. This is a final ultimate deliverance.
10:49 -  This isn't just a moment, a transient getting rid of a harassment or a vexation.
10:56 -  This is a permit. There'll be no, after this there's no more pursuit
11:02 -  of this child unto death. Therefore the spirit cried because it had no alternative.
11:10 -  But Rentim saw and came out of him and he was as one dead
11:17 -  insomuch that many said he is dead. Yes, he came out but he didn't come out gracefully.
11:23 -  He came out with that vicious spirit of spite that though it's compelled to end its torment
11:31 -  will take one last final stab at taking this hapless thing like a mad dog with a rag doll in its mouth
11:39 -  and just shaking the living stuffings out and throwing it down as dead. Yeah, I'm coming out
11:44 -  but in coming out I'm finishing the job. I'm required to obey you. But I'll take my time in how I come out
11:52 -  and I'll take the full toll in coming out that leaves this child as dead. So it's not just a deliverance for Israel
12:00 -  that will be required but a resurrection. No wonder the disciples staggered
12:05 -  and balked. Their faith was inadequate. Jesus took him by the hand.
12:11 -  Verse 27, lifted him up and he arose. Isn't that a great...
12:15 -  This is a resurrection not just a deliverance. An ultimate statement of authority.
12:20 -  You know we have in proportion we have a certain degree of faith and ability.
12:27 -  We can pray for someone with a sniffle a certain amount of confidence. We can handle that
12:32 -  but let someone come in with a wheelchair and oh we're stiffen or let someone be foaming at the mouth
12:38 -  and fall at our feet as a young man did in Africa
12:44 -  in a mud hut where I somehow was led on a certain Sunday morning to go from mud hut to mud hut
12:52 -  and say we're having a meeting with women and children you're invited.
12:58 -  Smoke filled places not wood fire smoke. A bunch of tough looking guys
13:03 -  that would just as soon do me in as attend the meeting
13:08 -  but remarkably they came. And what was the... I had no message
13:13 -  my usual condition and my message was the Lord's Prayer. His kingdom come on earth
13:20 -  as it is in heaven. As I'm coming to the last statement a young kid I don't know about 12, 11
13:27 -  he just began to wobble foam at the mouth and fall to the floor in a full fit
13:33 -  and there was dead silence and they were looking at me so to say okay hot shot
13:40 -  where's your kingdom now? You know what I found out later? Those men were the ones
13:48 -  that had massacred the community with which I had to do in Zimbabwe
13:54 -  only months before hacking every white soul to death with machetes
14:00 -  and binding their hands behind their backs with barbed wire the only two survivors
14:05 -  a teenage girl and a baby that ran out into the bush to hide. Murderous!
14:11 -  I didn't know that these were the same men and here I'm preaching and so I looked at this hapless thing
14:18 -  I don't know what I said, what I prayed but praise God this kid just began to rise up
14:25 -  and as he came through his height he said Jesus, Jesus, Jesus and broke the power of resistance
14:35 -  and unbelief incredulity, hostility in that room against Christ
14:41 -  demonstration of the power of God visible before their eyes and so not knowing who they were
14:49 -  I led them in a prayer for salvation and you should hear the chorus of voices that followed me.
14:58 -  We're going to be facing last days challenges of this kind and we need to bring
15:07 -  to that confrontation with the powers of darkness another reality you need to know
15:13 -  we're moving toward a final collision of a historic kind where what it amounts to is
15:20 -  a confrontation between two ultimate realities the reality of evil which has been hitherto relatively disguised
15:32 -  or concealed except that it erupts at certain times in history like the Nazi saga, the Nazi era
15:39 -  and other times painfully otherwise keeping low profile but in the last days
15:46 -  it's going to be full force and all of its horror and all of its ugliness
15:52 -  and its brutal nature and that's intimidating that's threatening
15:56 -  your faith just to glimpse it it just dissipates away that means that in order to deliver the sun
16:06 -  a reality greater than evil has got to confront it the reality of God as God
16:12 -  though he is invisible the one who can conduct the deliverance is one who brings a reality
16:20 -  greater than that by which he's confronted and will not find that reality in that moment if that reality has not itself been
16:29 -  growing and increase and taking the full reality of the inner man
16:39 -  not just on light occasions all occasions this is an ultimate collision
16:49 -  because these powers know to what degree the reality of God is with us that's the only thing they're required
16:57 -  to acknowledge and to see Jesus they know and Paul they know but who are you?
17:02 -  they can see right through pretense they can see right through religiosity they can see right through charismatic fun and games
17:09 -  they are required to recognize one thing only they found it in Jesus they found it in Paul
17:14 -  the authenticity of God himself as he in fact is and not as men suppose him to be
17:21 -  if we have an erroneous or inadequate notion of God we will not be able to meet an occasion of this kind the disciples even though they were with Jesus
17:32 -  three and a half years in his public ministry still had not obtained a sufficient measure of the reality that he represented as the Son of God
17:43 -  as to bring that reality into confrontation with the powers of darkness that's why Jesus said
17:49 -  how long must I suffer you? what does it take with you guys? you've had unparalleled privilege
17:55 -  to see the Son of God which is the revelation of the Father and you still don't know
18:00 -  and you still can't guess that and you're still terrified you're still intimidated
18:04 -  you're still weak you're still hapless you had the transfiguration on the Mount
18:10 -  you saw me glorified with the Moses of the Law and the Elijah of the Prophets
18:16 -  and you came down and how long did it take before that image dissipated that you could not retain?
18:23 -  the moment that you confronted evil it went out it was a whisper
18:28 -  it was not sufficient it was okay for charismatic you know, ordinary things
18:34 -  but when the confrontation with evil comes it's the ultimate thing where we need consciously to be moving
18:41 -  toward this collision at the end of the days because Jesus won't be there
18:46 -  to deliver this child it will either be us in his authority or those evil spirits will succeed
18:55 -  in the destruction of this nation got the picture? say yes
19:03 -  say amen thank you Lord okay
19:11 -  so when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could we not cast him out?
19:19 -  and he said unto them and to us and this is the punch line this kind can come forth by nothing
19:27 -  but by prayer and fasting this kind this ultimate kind
19:33 -  is not your everyday demonic spirit that you can command in whatever measure of faith and authority that you possess
19:40 -  this is ultimate evil this requires such a reality of God such an authority that comes with that knowledge
19:50 -  what is the source of spiritual authority? is it turning up the amplifiers? is it the raising of your voice?
19:57 -  in the name of Jesus if you can say it with greater volume that's the statement of authority
20:04 -  the powers of the air are not impressed with volume they're not touched by decibels they know whom to fear
20:14 -  where the reality of God is which the disciples evidently did not have because this ultimate kind
20:24 -  cometh forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting would to God that there's a footnote
20:32 -  to explain what he means by that because I suspect it's not prayer as we have until now understood it
20:41 -  it's not petitions we think prayer is petitions which has some validity
20:48 -  true prayer begins, ought to begin when the petitions end there's a dimension of prayer beyond
20:54 -  applying God with requests and it's in that dimension that something is formed
21:00 -  in the one who's in that prayerful relationship with God by which something is expressed and something is obtained there's something that is obtained
21:09 -  is the sense of God as God in the quiet places, unseen, unobtrusive early morning places of devotion with the Lord
21:20 -  is this thing being transacted and being obtained well you can see it even now
21:28 -  that the way in which men pray publicly is really a statement of what is their prayerful life privately
21:40 -  so we need to have a life of prayer a communion which is what Jesus had with the Father
21:48 -  when he rose early to seek the Father in prayer it was not to get instructions for the day
21:54 -  it was to be in communion with the Father who is God and the devotion that a son renders to a Father appropriately
22:03 -  how many of us have that devotional life? no one ever told me about it as a young believer I never heard a word about devotion
22:11 -  only in the most recent years just by the process of God and His mercy I stumbled into it
22:19 -  and now it has become so precious to me that if I have to forfeit the commencement of the day before the Lord in prayer, in devotional reading
22:29 -  and in communion I feel like the day has been set back the whole day will suffer the loss
22:35 -  of that initial first fruit time with God and you know the remarkable thing is you're not likely to feel anything
22:44 -  we sensual saints will not give ourselves unless there's a return yes we're willing to get up early
22:50 -  if we can feel the exhilarating sense of God's presence honoring our devotion but what if He doesn't provide it?
22:58 -  what if we're Australian all too Australian American all too American utilitarian all too utilitarian
23:06 -  that is to say we'll not invest anything time of early rising
23:11 -  unless there's some prospect of return you know dear saints even if that's unconscious as it ordinarily is
23:18 -  you're not in place of communion you're in a place of commerce you're transacting with God
23:24 -  so much invested in the hope of something to be obtained that's not communion that's not devotion
23:31 -  that's commerce devotion is time with the Lord without any strings attached
23:38 -  without any expectation any payoff that's because He is God and deserves it
23:44 -  and I believe that by the frequency of that continuing devotion before the Lord
23:51 -  something is in fact obtained though we don't come consciously to seek it and though we're not sensing or feeling anything
24:00 -  except on the rare occasions it pleases Him which we cannot commandeer something is coming to us of Himself
24:07 -  even as we are giving something of ourselves something is being built up in the inner man a sense of God
24:14 -  I don't know how to say it I don't know how to express it but Forsythe says
24:19 -  our lack of authority is mainly due to our lack of piercing moral realism the radicalism of the cross
24:29 -  we're lacking in authority because we're not morally conscious of the world and its issues because we don't like moral crisis
24:41 -  because we avoid tensions and conditions by which an apprehension of reality is to be obtained that has to do somehow with authority
24:54 -  with wrestling with contending in prayer with the Lord
25:01 -  and He says that way alone lies the reality on which man's moral soul rests and with his moral soul his future and his eternal destiny
25:11 -  the continual references in the writing of Forsythe to the moral soul which is the heart of man and his humanity
25:21 -  soul itself is a word that we don't employ we talk about soulish but there is a soul that needs to be nurtured
25:29 -  and by the springs of God where's that song that says that even when they pass through the valley of Daka they water it
25:39 -  their very presence makes the water to break out of dry ground they bring something with them that is internal that they carry
25:47 -  in their own pilgrim journey that blesses the very places through which they pass even though those places are places of testing
25:58 -  Baka, the valley of, it's not Baka, it's Baraka Baka
26:07 -  Baraka is blessing, Baraka is trial, testing, difficulty so he says the bane of much sanctity is its unreality its lack of contact with world reality
26:20 -  moral historic reality the recognition of what is the underlay of this world the realm of invisible spirit entities
26:29 -  the principalities and the powers of the air that was so real for Paul so real that he says
26:36 -  that the whole purpose of the church that God has created all things in order through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated
26:45 -  to the principalities and powers of the air what a recognition of this invisible realm that in God's sight is so utterly significant
26:55 -  that he did not hesitate to provide a platform for the church through creation so that they might in the end be confronted and defeated
27:03 -  by the greater reality that the church will present in the wisdom of God following that?
27:09 -  I don't know how you can you do, yeah? the wisdom of God is antithetical and opposite
27:18 -  to the wisdom of the powers of the air whose wisdom is destruction power
27:27 -  intimidation, threat and you know they've been ruling the world by that they jerk and manipulate nations
27:34 -  they can cause world wars they can cause racial genocide they can stir up an Africa
27:41 -  and they can have black against black wiping out an entire tribal entity by the million with machetes
27:50 -  they love blood, they love destruction their wisdom is to mar and to destroy the image of God in men and they'll do it through homosexuality, lesbianism
28:01 -  they'll do it through moral breakdown they'll do it through violence they'll do it through drugs
28:06 -  we would be fools not to recognize what are the ultimate invisible realities that affect this world
28:13 -  and which we are called to confront, combat and defeat not by the name of Jesus, I hope, I hope, I hope it works not by little formula
28:21 -  but by the bringing of a reality greater than what they represent they are deceivers, they are usurpers
28:27 -  they're trying to persuade the world that their reality is the true one that ambition, power, lust, gratification
28:38 -  sexual experimentation, all these things that this is life, this is reality, this is value it's utterly false, it's utterly destructive
28:47 -  there's only one presence in the earth that God has given by which their devious activity
28:53 -  can be recognized, identified and opposed we should blow the whistle on them but we cannot
29:00 -  if we are in any way exceeding to their wisdom if we are in any way moved by their values and have our own ambitions
29:11 -  and use their mentality in promoting our ministries and flooding the mailbox with mass distributions and flyers and leaflets
29:20 -  knowing that by the law of averages alone that if you send out 20 million letters if you get back a fraction
29:29 -  with an offering of some kind not only will you be more than compensated for the expense but you will eventually be rolling in millions
29:38 -  when you do that, you're playing the enemy's game that itself is intimidation that itself is using wiles beguiling
29:49 -  I remember I had the privilege to visit one of these mass ministries I will not tell you the name
29:59 -  and an entire building at that time with big IBM machines cranking out letters
30:07 -  in response to the mailings that have been received where they take the name I don't know how they do it
30:13 -  and it issues in a letter signed by the great man himself yes, I received your letter I'm in prayer for your aunt Matilda
30:20 -  thank you for your offering of $16.35 and the Lord be with you so that the sucker, when they get this IBM computed thing
30:32 -  which the great man of God never even sees and all of this is set in the electronic marvel believes that, oh, he's speaking to me
30:42 -  he knows me by name oh, he's praying for me I'll send another contribution
30:47 -  to whatever degree we accede to devices, to manipulation we are taking our cue from the powers of the air
30:58 -  for that is their mentality and their wisdom any manipulation, even of a wife with a husband who can be coy and fetching
31:08 -  and, you know, apply the pressure particularly in the bedroom that will bring him to a place of subservience
31:20 -  and what you want by the employment of feminine wiles that's the enemy we need to be so jealous, so careful
31:28 -  not in any way to be influenced by or employ the wisdom of the powers of the air for when the time of confrontation comes
31:38 -  to whatever degree we have yielded over the course of time to that wisdom we will be rendered inept
31:46 -  and incapable of confronting and challenging and bringing them to an end we've got to be impeccable in our separation
31:56 -  from the spirit of this world and recognize the evil that exists all the more difficult
32:02 -  because the evil parades is good the church has, in modern times, played down the demonic aspect, the issue of devil
32:12 -  it's not polite to talk about a devil and demons even my great theologian, Carl Bott thought that Paul's references to the principalities and powers of the air
32:24 -  were some kind of rabbinical hangover that he brought with him out of Judaism into his role as an apostle
32:32 -  and that we don't have to give serious regard to those references they are not polite but World War II and the rise of Nazism
32:40 -  completely turned this theologian around to recognize that Paul was not speaking out of some vestige of Judaism
32:49 -  but an acute, powerful, apostolic apprehension of ultimate realities, even though they be invisible and we need to have that same mindset
32:59 -  to recognize that we're in a cosmic struggle have been since time immemorial moving toward its final conclusion
33:06 -  in which the issue of the Jew is at stake because these powers, in order to keep their present usurping place as fallen angels who are in rebellion
33:16 -  who were given governmental roles to begin with to facilitate the work of God toward God instead we have become the Gods of this world
33:25 -  and turn the attention of men to themselves and demand not only their acknowledgement but their worship, the worship of the state
33:33 -  the worship of a Fuhrer the worship of an ideology are just thinly disguised elements
33:42 -  of worshiping the Gods of this world we need to see that we're in a cosmic struggle and it's moving toward this conclusion
33:50 -  symbolized and summarized in the episode given here for which the disciples were unable to cast it out because this kind will not come out, they'll not budge
34:01 -  unless you come to them out of an authority gained in the place of fasting and prayer so I want to spend the balance of the time
34:13 -  just sharing some thoughts about what kind of prayer that is it can't be pious prayer, it can't be false piety it can't be superficial things
34:23 -  but prayer itself is reality prayer itself brings us to reality in fact we have to fight for it, have you noticed?
34:32 -  in the devotional time you feel the cold draft coming up off the floor and the warm bed that beckons your return and some thought that arises that you're a fool to be in that place
34:44 -  and it's not up painting anything and you're losing valuable rest that you'll need for the rigors of the day
34:50 -  it's a fight, it's a struggle, there's a wrestling and a contending for something or else we're easily discouraged
35:00 -  and we cease when we should first be beginning so there's a persistence that's required and a reality obtained that is difficult
35:10 -  the realities that are of the world that issue from the powers of darkness are visible, attractive
35:17 -  full of guile, full of winsome seductive possibility that if you're ruled by seeing and feeling you're a dead duck
35:27 -  but the reality of God is in the realm of that which is unseen Paul says I see that which is invisible and eternal I see the invisible weight of glory
35:40 -  by which my present suffering is made both momentary and light his seeing was through the things that are apparent and visible
35:50 -  he focused his inner eye on the realm of that which is invisible and unseen he contended for, he wrestled toward and obtained a sense of reality beyond that which is offered us
36:04 -  in the realm of the things that are visible, sensual, felt and handled and so that reality that he saw that was invisible and eternal was more real for him than the things that were visible
36:19 -  did that unfit him to be an apostle? did that make him irrational? did that make him so heavenly minded that he's no earthly good?
36:27 -  or was it that very heavenly mindedness that made him the earthly good? we need to contend saints for the reality behind the reality for the reality that is reality
36:39 -  and despise that false counterfeit substitute that beckons men and is seductive having all the marbles and calling for that which is seen, felt, experienced
36:50 -  because we have become a sensual, sensate world your body, your feelings, how about this, your hair, your look, your pimples everything is so addressed to the external, outward man
37:02 -  and I'll tell you to the degree that you yield to it you're experiencing a like measure of spiritual loss there's a struggle for reality
37:13 -  whatever reality is, it's got to be with God at its heart and root and it's there, but it's not conveniently there and everything raised up by the flesh and the devil contends against it
37:27 -  we've got to see through and esteem that invisible realm that when the Lord comes at the end of the age
37:35 -  that invisible thing becomes the visible then that becomes the Jerusalem that has come down from above and prevails now it's being opposed
37:44 -  so now there's a requirement made of us to contend for the faith once and for all given to saints to contend for the reality of God
37:53 -  for the moral reality, for the recognition that we're in a cosmic struggle against opposing powers who are utterly vicious in their determination they seem to have all the marbles though they are a defeated foe
38:06 -  though he has rendered them at the cross what's the word? he stripped them
38:14 -  and made them an open spoil but he didn't remove them yes, their fangs have been removed
38:22 -  but they can still make a noise they know how to intimidate and threaten and seduce and appeal to men for lust and ambition
38:29 -  they are moving the world, they are the effectual Gods of this world jerking nations, jerking races by strings we need a knowledge of God, a measure of God
38:40 -  that eclipses their visible pretense in all of its apparent power because it can actually take a child and rack it back and forth and throw it in water and fire
38:53 -  and leave it as dead, foaming at the mouth this is not some hypothetical thing some innocuous evil that is only supposition
39:04 -  this is demonstrable power even though they have been defeated still able to take nations and jerk and strip
39:12 -  and bring death, foaming at the mouth so if we have an inadequate measure of faith which is only hoping for a Cadillac
39:25 -  prosperity and we are faced now to bring the reality of God in the measure that we have it
39:33 -  and we all have it in a different measure appropriate to and relative to our walk our life, our relationships
39:42 -  our prayer, our communion our trust, our history, our experience with God for example, after the Lord showed me
39:53 -  when I got back this afternoon to my room not knowing what to bring tonight in five minutes time the Lord made clear prayer
40:02 -  this text I knew it, I looked it over and then I could try and take a nap
40:09 -  which I needed and I had a 5.30 appointment to counsel some precious saints
40:17 -  and I woke up by myself 5.15 the Lord was so real that He allowed me in His great love
40:28 -  to have rest to the final moment when I see His sovereignty and I see it so many times
40:36 -  the meeting will end exactly at the hour hand this will happen in such a way when you are walking with the Lord
40:45 -  and you are fully giving yourself to Him the revelation of His love, His mercy His sovereignty, His truth, His power
40:54 -  is built, there's increment and there's a reality that is inward that eclipses the reality that is outward and external
41:04 -  so you can walk through the world like a giant, not a pygmy not at all intimidated
41:09 -  in whatever country or circumstance because greater is He who is within you than He who is in the world
41:16 -  that's not a formula, that's a reality that greatness has grown in the history that you have with the Lord
41:22 -  particularly in the history of suffering and obedience where you see His faithfulness and prayer is not a technique or a method
41:32 -  it's the statement of the measure of that reality so Forsythe says we have to secure our foundations anew we have constantly to acquire what we inherit
41:44 -  he's that strange kind of a writer the actual is one thing, the real is another what is this guy saying?
41:52 -  the actual is one thing, the real is another you mean what is actual is not the real thing? it only appears to be
41:58 -  it seems to have all the marbles it seems to have the impressive dimensions it makes sounds, it makes noise
42:03 -  it needs to be fed, it's gratified, it's real no, the actual is not the real the real is something more than what is visibly actual
42:12 -  and that more is uttermost reality and it's that reality that has got to be brought to the point of collision
42:20 -  when we face the powers of darkness and head on and has got to be greater than what they represent or they'll see right through it
42:29 -  so in the Philippines I'll always remember giving this invitation on a hot afternoon ministers' conference
42:36 -  about, I don't know, 150 or so Filipinos, precious men wearing suits and they're ministers now
42:45 -  and I said to them at the end what do you prefer? to be impressive to men
42:52 -  or to be known of the powers of the earth? take your choice you can play the religious game
42:59 -  and climb the ladder of success as you have in some measure already and it has saved you out of poverty
43:06 -  now you're living reasonably and have some measure of security for your family are you willing to risk that
43:13 -  by not aspiring to continuing religious success and to allow the Lord so to form you that what is truest about you
43:22 -  makes the powers of darkness to fear to be known by the powers of darkness as one to be avoided
43:31 -  and that terrifies them is more to be desired than the recognition of men and their esteem
43:38 -  and you know what? you can't have both so long as you're craven
43:43 -  and want men to recognize you and your ministry and you're playing the game rightly
43:50 -  and the kind of piety and the familiar phrases that it deserves you'll attain it
43:56 -  but the powers of the air will yawn in your face so I gave them invitation who will stand to die to
44:05 -  and forfeit professional and ministerial success climbing the ladder finding acceptance with men
44:14 -  and allowing the Lord so to affect and shape your walk and career destiny that you will be known of the powers of darkness and feared
44:24 -  it's one thing to ask that of people in Australia United States because their ministries is not a salvation from poverty
44:34 -  but to say it to Filipinos the threat of the loss of ministries the loss of the measure of material success
44:40 -  they've obtained through ministry and to be a danger and a threat to the powers of darkness might require that loss
44:48 -  and I've never seen men get up with greater trembling and fear
44:54 -  and trepidation than those men rising it was a transaction with heaven
45:00 -  that will affect the destiny of that locality and perhaps the nation because something is transacted
45:07 -  that makes the powers of darkness to tremble because they recognize this is not a little ceremonial conclusion to a meeting this is earnest
45:15 -  and these men are serious God is taking them seriously and they will then thereafter constitute a threat
45:22 -  to the powers of darkness which up to that time have not been at all recognized let alone threatened
45:29 -  that's what it takes that's why Jesus was such a threat Jesus we know Paul we know
45:35 -  no question about it they are so in God they have such an integrity
45:40 -  a single-eyed totality of devotion toward God they're willing for the price
45:46 -  and the suffering unto death them we know and fear
45:52 -  because with that measure and knowledge of God which they have is a corresponding reality
45:58 -  remember when that woman touched Jesus's garment and the flow of blood
46:04 -  that she had for 12 years was instantly staunched though doctors could not have performed it and she was paying her
46:10 -  a lifetime of savings in order to find help
46:16 -  but touch his garment and when she did she was healed and Jesus it says
46:22 -  felt that that virtue had gone out from him and who touched him
46:28 -  and he turned to see and they said what are you talking about everyone's touching you
46:34 -  only one woman touched you in a faith that drew out your virtue
46:40 -  it's an Elizabethan word where in other editions they say power because the virtue is power
46:46 -  and power is virtue listen you dear saints I'm off on a tangent
46:52 -  that I'm loving because the word virtue has moral connotations so can we suspect that
47:00 -  Jesus has power in a magical supply by virtue of his deity but in proportion to his
47:06 -  virtue, in proportion to his obedience, in proportion to his character, in his walk
47:12 -  in a moral way so that every act of obedience which has to do with character
47:18 -  and choice brings an enablement by the spirit of God
47:26 -  because the obedience to God cannot be performed out of our inadequate humanity, we're not called to
47:32 -  convenient obedience, it requires an enablement by the spirit for the spirit is given to them who obey
47:38 -  him, but what we need to understand what God is stirring in me I believe is that when the spirit is given
47:44 -  not only is the enablement given but the character of the life of God is in the spirit is given also
47:50 -  we're receiving much more than just an energy for obedience, what we're
47:56 -  receiving is the character and the nature
48:06 -  of God in his spirit because his spirit is God it's not an abstract gas
48:12 -  it's not an abstract energy it's himself, so when he imparts his life for an
48:18 -  act of obedience of a moral kind that is costly he's not only giving the enablement
48:24 -  of the energy, he's giving himself and the same thing happens in the place of communion
48:30 -  so obedience and communion are the two means available to us by
48:36 -  which a residue of virtue of the character of God and
48:42 -  of power and authority is increased and we
48:48 -  will have it in proportion to the measure of the life of obedience and the life of devotion and
48:54 -  the powers of darkness have the uncanny ability to know to what degree you have it
49:00 -  Jesus they know and Paul they know, but who are you? They see right through the apparent spirituality
49:06 -  and whatever language we can employ as cliche and slogans, they know what
49:12 -  measure of Christ is in you, what measure of virtue what measure of the moral reality
49:18 -  of God is yours by virtue of your walk and your devotion and if you don't have it
49:24 -  you can talk till you're blue in the face in the name of Jesus I command you nothing, it's like water
49:30 -  off the duck's back, but if you have it one word and they're compelled to come out
49:36 -  you know what I'm saying that the issue of Israel's deliverance, if this is symbolic, this boy who has been
49:42 -  harassed under death since infancy is the symbolic statement of Israel in its whole history
49:48 -  of being attacked and whose destruction has been sought by these powers, then the issue
49:54 -  of their deliverance in the last days is the church the church that is the church
50:02 -  that can come to them in the same authority as Jesus himself so much so, not only
50:08 -  sufficient to deliver, but sufficient to raise him up out of death that's authority
50:14 -  that's the life of God it's an it's an astonishment
50:20 -  that God predicates the whole issue of Israel's final deliverance at the end of the days
50:26 -  not by act of heroism but by the issue of our devotion that what we
50:32 -  conduct, hidden and quiet in our own chambers is what in the end
50:38 -  is the thing that affects the final deliverance of Israel
50:44 -  do not cease to pray the chief failure of prayer is its cessation
50:50 -  Forsythe, what is he saying we stop at the very time when we should be continuing, we've finished
50:56 -  our petitions, what more is there to say well, there's a whole dimension beyond petition, but have you
51:02 -  even begun to touch it or is it just plying God with your needs Lord I need this, I need that
51:08 -  well what about beyond that, he knows your needs before you pray, what he's wanting is your communion he's wanting your fellowship
51:14 -  he's wanting you to be in a loving posture with him and he honors your giving
51:20 -  of yourself for that by the giving of himself, so even though you felt nothing because you're not seeking for feeling
51:26 -  something has been deposited and every day adds
51:32 -  to that deposit and so by that cumulative deposit when the moment of confrontation
51:38 -  comes, the powers of the air know whom to fear I've had a multitude of prophecies
51:44 -  spoken over me in over 40 years and the one that I love that is most choice
51:50 -  for me than any other is that the powers of the air will be terrified by you Art
51:56 -  let that be, because if I'm in a place to terrify the powers of the air, you can be assured
52:02 -  that many other things are attended by the same thing that gives me the authority to
52:08 -  terrify them, a love relationship, a quality of service
52:14 -  for the church, everything is subsumed in what will terrify
52:20 -  the powers of darkness, which is the reality of God, which we express in sharing, we express
52:26 -  in relationship, but we express in ultimate confrontation with those powers to the degree that
52:32 -  we have it. Don't stop when you should be continuing because the Lord's purpose
52:38 -  is to bring you father in unto himself. Don't be dissuaded if you don't
52:46 -  feel anything. If it comes that's icing on the cake, but you're not there
52:52 -  to feel. In fact the great test will come in the crisis of obedience when
52:58 -  we will say with Jesus, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? I can tell you
53:04 -  dear saints, I know it already, the ultimate crisis of our obedience to the end of days will be like unto
53:10 -  his. At the moment of greatest test, when we yearn for the sense of God's presence to be
53:16 -  with us in that crisis time is the very time that it will be withheld. Why?
53:22 -  Because there's something more than power that needs to be expressed. It's a wisdom
53:28 -  of another kind that God has saved people out by His sanctifying work
53:34 -  from the wisdom of the world rooted in feeling, sensuality, in
53:40 -  confirmation that is, help me, when you can touch
53:46 -  empirical, tactile. So we have to be brought out from that realm
53:52 -  of the sensual realm that needs to feel in order to confirm and to be as confident
53:58 -  that God is there when His presence is not felt as much as when it is.
54:04 -  So you can imagine the kind of madman I am that when some characters came to a prophetic
54:12 -  conference in Minneapolis to teach us how to invoke the presence of God through worship, as if we could manipulate
54:18 -  God. Here's that manipulation. Talk about arrogance. If we'll not hesitate
54:24 -  to manipulate God to obtain His presence, what will we do with men? What will we do in the church?
54:30 -  What will we do to affect an altar call? A financial response? What strings will we pluck?
54:36 -  What emotions will we play upon? That work! You've got to lean backwards to avoid
54:42 -  being sucked into that vortex that welcomes you with open arms.
54:48 -  Lest you give yourself to that which will rob you of credibility in
54:54 -  God, because you have yielded to the spirit of the world. And so these guys are going to teach us
55:02 -  what choruses we can sing in order to bring God down. Phew! I got up
55:08 -  foaming. I said you guys would do better to teach us how to be obedient
55:14 -  in the absence of God's felt presence, rather than to ourselves produce it.
55:20 -  Because we're moving toward a final demonstration of the wisdom of God that requires obedience
55:26 -  in the absence of His felt presence. Not what's required of Jesus,
55:32 -  it will be required of us. And we'll be able to give obedience because we have a history
55:38 -  of being before the Lord independent of whether or not we feel the gratifying sense of
55:44 -  His presence. Only rarely do I ever get that in my morning time. I remember
55:50 -  I had finished my morning it usually runs one to two hours. And I was holding
55:56 -  I just made myself a communion. I carry a little sack I showed you with my broken matzah and my little bottle of wine.
56:02 -  I held the wine and the sack to my chest. I don't know why I did that. It was like an involuntary
56:08 -  unthinking thing that was so dear to me. And that moment that it touched my chest, phew!
56:14 -  A sense of God came over me like an oil coming down the crown of my head. Oh!
56:20 -  Lord, if I could only retain that moment. Can we build three booths? One for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah.
56:26 -  Can we nail this down and keep this permanently? No. It will go in a moment
56:32 -  and you've got to come down into the valley and face what you must face. Ultimate issues of reality
56:38 -  without the sense that and the vision that you had on the Mount. So prayer, this
56:44 -  kind, does not come out except by the reality obtained by prayer as communion
56:50 -  beyond petition. The pressure on us is kept up till the soul's union with God is set.
56:56 -  How did Forsythe know this? How did he write this? Where did he get this?
57:02 -  Out of communion. He didn't get it out of a textbook on how to pray. He got it out of
57:08 -  the school of the reality of prayer and communion and such insight. He's got a whole book called
57:14 -  The Soul of Prayer. I'm just giving you a few fragments just to stir you. In God's eyes
57:20 -  the great object of prayer is the opening or restoring of free communion
57:26 -  with himself. In a kingdom of Christ, a life communion which may even amid our
57:32 -  duty and service become as unconscious as the beating of our heart.
57:38 -  This is not some self-conscious religious activity but it becomes so formidable
57:44 -  so much the everyday life you cannot conceive of a day that does not begin in the place of
57:50 -  devotion. So it becomes as automatic as breathing. Without self-consciousness
57:56 -  it's no longer religious. It's not how many chapters you have to read in order to fulfill the requirement for communion
58:02 -  that day. If you have to read a certain number of chapters it's no longer communion.
58:08 -  It's religion. So in this sense every true prayer brings its answer
58:16 -  in our obtaining a deeper and closer place in God and his purpose. If prayer is
58:22 -  God's great gift, it is the one inseparable from the giver. Prayer is a gift.
58:28 -  If we are forming it, we're falling short of its real beauty and power. The prayers
58:34 -  of God are the ones that really perform. And when he gives those prayers
58:40 -  he gives himself. He's not just the giver of the gift. He gives himself in the gift. And that's why we're retaining
58:46 -  and obtaining something in that communion of himself. He's a giver. So he is
58:52 -  actively with us as we pray. Prayer is the highest use to which speech can
58:58 -  be put. Even encourages the
59:04 -  facility of speech that when we move from prayer to other communication
59:10 -  we're bringing a certain aura of blessing with us. And the use of language.
59:16 -  And prayers don't have to be long or humanly eloquent. But the earnestness
59:22 -  the sense that we're really communing with a living God independent of the confirming
59:28 -  feeling is a whole realm of reality that's invisible. And insensate
59:34 -  cannot be measured in the realm of feeling, but it's measured in the realm of spirit.
59:40 -  That's where the authority comes. What is an apostle and a prophet? What is their authority? That they
59:46 -  know how to solve church problems because they can quote Paul? They bring with them
59:52 -  the sense of God as God. That Paul could say you know what manner
59:58 -  of man I was with you from the beginning. You heard the word of God from me. You knew it. You received
01:00:06 -  it for what it was. Not the word of man but the word of God. Which performs their work in them that believe that
01:00:12 -  that turned you from your idols to serve the living God and wait for his son to come from heaven who will save you from
01:00:18 -  the wrath to come. Where do they get a message like that from a Jewish
01:00:24 -  apostle? And they were Gentiles and pagans that they should
01:00:30 -  hear that strange message and believe in the Jesus that he commends unto a faith
01:00:36 -  that turns them from their idols. Imagine the power ages old paganism turned
01:00:42 -  in the power of the word that issued from that man to serve the living God and to welcome the
01:00:48 -  persecution that would inevitably come from the pagan world that will oppose them for turning from their idols.
01:00:58 -  He came with authority. He brought the sense of God. Because he came trailing clouds
01:01:04 -  of glory. He came out of God's presence. He came from the holy place. He came as it were sent from
01:01:10 -  the throne where somewhere in the private chamber that I saw
01:01:16 -  in Wesley in London his literal actual chamber, his prayer
01:01:22 -  chamber, just enough for a man who weighs 145 pounds to have space. But what was
01:01:28 -  transacted there devastated the nation and saved it from a revolution that came to France.
01:01:34 -  There was a power coming into the midst of men ready to crown his head with bricks hating his guts
01:01:40 -  as he opposed the mainline church and brought a threatening message and without amplifiers
01:01:46 -  speaking sometimes to 10, 15 or 20,000 in open air situations. Authority,
01:01:52 -  power, that was obtained in the quiet unobtrusive place of devotion.
01:01:58 -  The prayer, classic. In it were made partakers of the divine nature.
01:02:04 -  Man rises to be a co-worker with God in the highest sense. As such communion
01:02:10 -  prayer is no mere rapport. No mere contact. It is the central act of
01:02:16 -  the soul. Forsythe for president. Just for that one statement.
01:02:26 -  I'd run out of the way to do anything. A man who can compose a statement like that
01:02:32 -  can retire. Deserves the highest acknowledgement that this is the central
01:02:38 -  act of the soul. We thought it was just a subsidiary.
01:02:44 -  We thought it was not the real, it's not the real thing. The real thing is ministry.
01:02:50 -  What we do and what we perform. Prayer is a nice accompaniment. The central act of the soul.
01:02:58 -  That's what made Forsythe, Forsythe. And Chambers, Chambers. And Spurgeon, Spurgeon.
01:03:04 -  And Wesley, Wesley. The absence of which makes us what we are. Jesus we know, Paul we know.
01:03:14 -  Who are you? You upstarts using the vocabulary. You're taking cities? Come on.
01:03:20 -  Couldn't fight your way through a paper bag. You're in a party. You're sentimental, you're shallow.
01:03:26 -  If you don't get confirmation and feelings you come undone. And you wonder if you're even saved.
01:03:32 -  You're troubled, you're full of doubts and consternation. You don't come with that sense of the absolute
01:03:38 -  and the ultimate and the eternal because you've not been in that realm to obtain it consistently.
01:03:48 -  It is the central act of the soul, organic with Christ's. It is that which brings it into tune with the whole
01:03:54 -  universe as God's act. Prayer and communion I don't know how to say this.
01:04:00 -  Brings you into the cosmic sense of God. You know how many times I use the word cosmic?
01:04:06 -  Have you noticed? When have you used it? Cosmic. The whole overarching
01:04:12 -  reality, the whole redemptive saga, the whole sense of it from its inception.
01:04:18 -  From God who left his heaven to come down into earth. The whole thing that has been working through the
01:04:24 -  generations. The climax of the ages through the issue of Israel's restoration through the church.
01:04:30 -  Somehow it's not that God has to teach us line upon line
01:04:36 -  but you're imbued. You have a sense of the uttermost realities
01:04:42 -  that makes the faith the faith. There's a greatness, there's a sense of of magnitude of what it is to which
01:04:48 -  we're called that can only be communicated in the place of prayer. Not because God tells you what it is
01:04:54 -  but imparts to you the sense of it. Got the idea? So when you go to Kenya
01:05:00 -  as I did last time and arrived on a hot afternoon in my short pants thinking that the meeting was
01:05:06 -  that night. No, the meeting was that afternoon and it was already in progress. I'm in my short pants.
01:05:12 -  Well that's no way to present yourself before the saints in Africa. You've got to be dressed appropriately as the messenger of the gospel.
01:05:18 -  So I sent one of the other brothers to do the speaking but I could see it was flat. It's not what God was
01:05:24 -  wanting and finally it was coming to an end and nothing had been transacted. So I got up and I said
01:05:30 -  you think God can anoint a man with short pants? God staged this
01:05:36 -  to confront their false piety which they obtained from
01:05:42 -  Great Britain. And we're going to do it better than Whitey.
01:05:48 -  And the Lord showed them that he can anoint a man with short pants.
01:05:54 -  I got up to say that. I had no message but as I'm speaking
01:06:00 -  the thought came about Paul and his conversion and sending Ananias and
01:06:06 -  tell him what great things he must suffer for my namesake. And I cited that. I said do you know
01:06:12 -  that we're called to great things? They blinked. They didn't know they were called to
01:06:18 -  great things. They thought we were called to a succession of Sunday services. Which they were doing
01:06:24 -  in their history. That's all they knew. Prescribed, limited, dull,
01:06:30 -  unchanging series of services. They didn't know that they were called to greatness.
01:06:40 -  You can't imbue men with that sense until your own soul has been
01:06:46 -  imbued by it in the place of communion. The greatness of God.
01:06:52 -  Yes we can talk about adoration but we're only talking about it. It will not come
01:06:58 -  until we are infused with the majesty of God. Both through our experience
01:07:04 -  in His faithfulness and our obedience and by the reality of His presence though unfelt
01:07:10 -  in communion. It's part and function of the creative preservative energy of God
01:07:16 -  given. Well I think we're going to
01:07:22 -  end tonight with prayer.
