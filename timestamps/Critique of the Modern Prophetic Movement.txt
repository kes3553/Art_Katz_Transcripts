Critique of the Modern Prophetic Movement

00:00 -  Good morning, dear Saints. That was a precious introduction. I've never been so honored and flattered and alluded to as I'm now hearing. I hope I recover. It sounds like the Lord's setting the stage for an enormous collapse. So, precious God, what can we add to the prayer that has been prayed? If you'll only fulfill that prayer, you'll not have a whimper of complaint from me.
00:36 -  So let it be, Lord, an extraordinary statement, not calculated for our titillation, but for our repentance for a bringing down that you might bring up. Stab us, my God, with truth, things as you see and understand them, however much they are at variance with our own perception, we desire yours. So come, Lord, and turn this time into an event of an ultimate kind whose time has come and remarkably in conjunction with the unhappy collapse fall of a notable man,
01:17 -  an internationally known Lord that somehow seems to be more than circumstantial, but appropriate both to the time, the occasion, and the things that you are already putting into my heart. So do we bless you, Lord, precious God, your living God, your great altogether. We love you because you are truth. And help us, my God, in our terrible frailty, infirmity, to be worthy of you, my God, and to stand for you, bear your words before men.
01:51 -  Help us through your divine integrity, Lord, ours is so much less, and we bless you and thank you and give you praise for the high standard that you are in yourself and the great provision for us to meet it through the excellent power of your life. Come now and express yourself out of that life and move your ministers to jealousy, not only what they hear but what they see, the thing in itself to which they also are called.
02:22 -  We thank you and give you praise in Jesus' name. Amen. And you can turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 23, the Lord's condemnation of false prophets, which might well be a condemnation of falsity itself, especially where it's most painful when it issues out of ministers.
02:50 -  So may the Lord give us insight and an understanding that what is touched here is much more than prophets who are in error but ministers who are in error, so much so that they don't even perceive it. And it's hard to know where to leap in, but the Lord speaks about a horrible thing in verse 14.
03:20 -  They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness. They are all of them unto me as Sodom and the inhabitants therefore as Gomorrah. Therefore, thus saith the Lord of Hosts concerning the prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of Gaul.
03:44 -  For from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Harken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you. They make you vain. They speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord.
04:02 -  They say, Still unto them that despise me. The Lord hath said, You shall have peace. And they say unto everyone that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord and hath perceived and heard his word?
04:20 -  Who hath marked his word and heard it? Behold, the world-wind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous world-wind. It shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
04:32 -  The anger of the Lord shall not return until he hath executed, till he hath performed the thoughts of his heart. In the latter days you shall consider it perfectly. I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran.
04:46 -  I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. But if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from the evil way and from the evil of their doings.
04:59 -  Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?
05:09 -  For I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? Yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart,
05:23 -  which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams, which they tell, tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream, and he that speaks my word, let him speak my word faithfully.
05:41 -  What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord? Is not my word like a fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that steal my words, every one from his neighbor.
05:56 -  Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that cause their tongues, that use their tongues, and say, he saith. Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their likeness.
06:12 -  Yet I sent them not, nor commanded them, therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord. So, this is more than an appraisal of the prophets of old. It is profoundly contemporary, and I think especially for the prophets of our charismatic time and generation,
06:37 -  but that we need to understand how the whole of society, the whole of the church is affected by what is fraudulent and casual and light. It brings a profaneness into the whole land. It cheapens the whole texture of the faith. We're all adversely affected, even if we don't know these men, even if we don't hear them.
07:06 -  Somehow the role of the prophet is so central to the sounding of God and his heart, that any false expression of that has adverse consequence that can't even be measured. But how shall I say it? I hope I'm not exaggerating.
07:27 -  Is the whole of our contemporary Christianity fraudulent? Is it a whole play acting? Is it remarkably in error that is so pervasive and perhaps so compelling and attractive and biblical, at least in its vocabulary, that it purports to be true and has been accepted as true,
07:56 -  but something is rotten in Denmark, if I can quote Shakespeare, and we need to find the root of that because the stench is rising and the first visible phenomena of God's anger and fury is already being expressed
08:14 -  in the public exposure of a man who enjoyed international renown as the prophet of the Allah and the oracle of God for the church in this time, who had never impressed me personally, and yet he impressed many.
08:39 -  Could it be that the alcoholism and homosexuality with which he's being charged is not the root and cause of God's displeasure and judgment, but is the symptom of a deeper malady, a deeper sinfulness that will express itself horrendously
09:00 -  and externally and shamefully in the moral way, but the root is deeper. The root is the willingness to be introduced as the oracle of the hour and the prophet of the hour and not rise in protest and say, you're saying too much, I'm undeserving of that acknowledgement,
09:23 -  and for me to sit on the platform and to hear myself described in that way will do serious damage to the faith because I'm not that. I have a gift of personal prophecy perhaps, but to call me the oracle
09:42 -  when I do not bring oracular statements is a title and an acknowledgement that I cannot allow to pass for truth and for integrity's sake. So we're not only guilty of what we speak, we're guilty of our silences when we should speak.
10:03 -  What do these false prophets say? They always speak so-called positive things. They affirm us and confirm us and they're pleasant to hear. Even when they make allusions to Israel, it's in a kind of general way that sounds honorific.
10:22 -  They pray and acknowledge the peace of Jerusalem, and they want to see the state to survive its present troubles, and they make the kinds of conventional sounds with regard to Israel that in my opinion are intrinsically false but widely accepted because it confirms the church
10:41 -  in a comparable kind of sentimental affinity and endorsement that is improper, biblically, prophetically speaking, but is kind and nice and desires something well-meaning. But the church is called to so much more than that and other than that
11:03 -  and is doing Israel actual disservice to affirm it and to encourage it and to think that it's going to pass its present crisis and somehow gradually by a process of amelioration and progressive improvement become the prophetic fulfillment
11:20 -  which we all desire to see and will be saved from the necessity of having to pass through apocalyptic fury, devastation, and judgment unto death that it might be raised up out of the ashes of that death as a resurrected nation
11:38 -  because its calling pertains to the glory of God forever and that can and must only issue out of resurrection through death. So to applaud Israel in her present condition and hope only for improvement
11:53 -  is so much more than a well-meaning acknowledgement. It's a statement of ourselves, the shallowness of what we are about and the willingness to agree with generalities of a kind that are so visibly contradicted
12:11 -  in scripture if we would pay attention to it because we don't have a stomach for calamity and we shrink from apocalyptic scenarios and we want to see improvement and progressive amelioration rather than death and radical transformation
12:30 -  not only for Israel but also for ourselves. So I'm just throwing that in. That's just a little bonus. For who has stood in the Council of the Lord in verse 18?
12:44 -  Who has really stood? The very word who rings powerfully to suggest not many, Lord. Who, as his eye roams to and fro over the face of the Church, who among them
12:59 -  especially who allow themselves to be acknowledged as prophets or apostles have actually stood in the Council of the Lord hath perceived and heard his word because his word is something other than our own.
13:15 -  It's really nice. It's really, really comforting. You'll know that it's his word because when it comes it always requires. It's always a requiring word rather than a comforting and an affirming word
13:30 -  though occasionally the Lord might in his grace bestow that. But who has an ear to hear that kind of thing from God so as himself to speak and to proclaim it?
13:42 -  Not many or God would not be saying who. Who has stood? We're too fretful. We're too much in movement. There's too much activity.
13:53 -  We can't allow silences and waiting and the kinds of things that would allow us to come in to the place of the Council of the Lord. We're too distracted.
14:04 -  We can't afford early morning devotional times because we have a heavy agenda ahead of us and all kinds of administrative details to consider
14:15 -  because we are more CEOs than we are men of God. The whole nature of the Church and its success militates against being still, being in the place of quiet, being able to hear.
14:31 -  There's an urgency. There's an agenda. There's something that needs to be attended that even if there were time to find the Council of God by standing still,
14:42 -  our disposition is already ruined. The mechanics of our religion have already so affected our disposition that even if we had the leisure and the time we wouldn't know how to employ it.
14:59 -  Our mind would be racing with what needs to be attended. We couldn't give God the kind of attention that he deserves in order to stand in his council and to hear him.
15:10 -  And even if by some remarkable grace that were possible, would we have the courage to speak the words that we hear there? Who has mocked this word and heard it?
15:23 -  Who has really given heed to his word? Because his word is always a requiring word, radically requiring, drastically requiring.
15:35 -  In fact, not an exaggeration to say, it's almost always and invariably an invitation to death. So that word came forth in this place last night.
15:44 -  You need to get the tape. And there was an appropriate response, the people actually shaking at the altar as the pastor himself noted.
15:54 -  But it almost was interpreted more as an invitation to a deeper level of consecration than it was to an invitation for death. See how we always avoid the totality of God's requirement in an honorific way
16:11 -  because a deeper consecration is not a bad thing, but it's not the ultimate thing. It's an adjusted thing that we can well afford to accommodate because it does not require our death.
16:25 -  It only requires our deeper consecration, which we're only too glad to make because that ought to ensue in a better quality of ministry and blessedness.
16:36 -  So who has really given heed to his word and really heard it so as to proclaim it with the risk of loss? Because you can't proclaim a word that makes ultimate requirement of people
16:53 -  and not pay a price for that. Someone has got to be offended. Flesh has got to be jarred.
17:00 -  People will find a place where that kind of requirement is not made of them. So it's hard to believe that both to hear and to speak the word of the Lord does not come at price and cause agitation, unrest,
17:17 -  and disjuncture. And how many of you pastors want to avoid that? By all means, the last thing you want to consider
17:29 -  is that your people should hear a word from God of such a kind that is not all wrapped up in one speaking, and that though they may be momentarily challenged,
17:39 -  at the end it'll be happy, and they'll go home rejoicing and in a happy mood and disposition rather than they should go home in a painful state of confusion
17:50 -  or bewilderment of what is God saying, and that they should wait and look to the Lord to allow that word to be sifted through their deeps
18:00 -  and it's the application to the realities of their life that will not be done in one message. What is it about our time and our generation
18:08 -  that everybody has to go home happy? Why can't they go home jarred and agitated and deeply disquieted and compelled to search?
18:20 -  What does this mean? This man is speaking in mysteries and it's not all complete in this now generation
18:28 -  that has to have it now and immediately. So if that's what rules you as a minister who wants to make sure that the people go home happy
18:38 -  lest they don't come back again, how are you going to be given both the hearing and the speaking the word of God
18:45 -  that calls to a totality, makes requirement that cannot be altogether fathomed and understood even in one hearing?
18:53 -  So the Lord is not pleased with this deference to man, this accommodating spirit that pervades our modern day Christianity even in its best forms
19:05 -  and his fury is going forth. I think we're seeing now the first statement and expression but it will not end there
19:13 -  because it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. And don't think that the wicked have horns. God is always contrasting the righteous with the wicked
19:25 -  and the wicked implies for me those who should know better have had opportunity to know better
19:35 -  and even in the face of a better knowledge or understanding are still acting grievously and even are opposed to the righteous
19:46 -  and call the true prophet false and a danger to the church and causing unrest and disquiet, etc.
19:58 -  So we shall know in the latter days and consider perfectly and these latter days are now and may we consider the heart of the Lord
20:10 -  in what is being expressed in judgment and what is coming forth out of this piece of dust this morning before you
20:18 -  who says I have not sent these prophets yet they ran. I have not spoken to them yet they prophesied. I don't have a word for this.
20:26 -  Presumption doesn't say enough. Of course it certainly is presumption to think that you're sent
20:34 -  and that the word that you're speaking is God's. It's deception of an ultimate kind by men who don't know him as they ought
20:43 -  and have not sought him as they ought and yet they have an inkling of disposition, a flare, a certain thing
20:49 -  and they're ready to go off with that and say thus saith the Lord. I don't know that I've recovered
20:55 -  from that full gospel breakfast where was it in Germany or some place where some Swedish man of the hour
21:01 -  wearing his whatchamacallit shirt Gucci is it whose trademark is quite conspicuous
21:09 -  so we can see how well dressed he is because after all his prosperity and his affluence
21:16 -  is the statement of his faith and he's wearing it so that you can see it and he began by saying
21:22 -  this morning the Lord spoke to me and gave me a word for you. I said oh wow
21:29 -  I'm leaning forward in my seat. I want to hear every syllable of the word that has come to him
21:36 -  for us this morning and as he went on to speak and to share what was that purported word
21:42 -  I slumped back in my seat and have not recovered to this day. It was no more the word of God
21:52 -  than the cow jumping over the moon. It was a piece of fraudulence but the remarkable thing is
22:00 -  that I think that the man actually believed that it was the word of God and that it had given to him.
22:07 -  After all, didn't the thought come into his head as he was shaving? Isn't that God?
22:13 -  Because God knows he's going to a full gospel breakfast and he'll be the speaker
22:19 -  so isn't that straight thought the Lord's thought and isn't it consonant with scripture
22:25 -  so it must be his? There's such a presence, there's such a shallowness,
22:31 -  there's such a casual air, there's such a lack of the real knowledge of God as God.
22:37 -  There's so little time spent in his presence and the knowledge of him for all of our talk about his presence
22:43 -  that the first straight thought that comes, boom, and then we have the audacity, the gumption,
22:49 -  the Jews have a word for it, the chutzpah, the unbridled arrogance
22:55 -  the Lord spoke to me, the Lord said to me doesn't he know that when it comes forth
23:01 -  it's hardly more than a cliché? It doesn't have enough weight to be sustained in a paper bag.
23:08 -  There's no weightiness in that utterance, there's nothing oracular,
23:14 -  there's no freshness, there's nothing that suggests that it has come from the throne of God
23:20 -  that it's a now present statement. It's a cheapie. But you know what?
23:30 -  The whole audience drank it up and loved it and applauded it
23:36 -  because it made no requirement of them and came with a certain air of titillation. And after all it was expressed by
23:43 -  the man of God for the hour who is in an overwhelming success because his church has how many?
23:49 -  One, two thousand or more? Can you understand? The whole scheme of things stinks.
23:58 -  It's a rotten fraud. But it's amazing how it can be sucked up by God's people.
24:08 -  And there's not one who blinks except cats and we know that he's queer
24:17 -  because you've not kept your heart with all diligence. You've not guarded your spirit.
24:24 -  You've opened it for any intrusion of anything that purports to be spirit that is really soul.
24:30 -  So much so that the distinction is blurred and anything that comes that has some appearance
24:37 -  of spirituality or whatever with an ability to stir and touch emotion is received of you.
24:45 -  You don't know what price you're paying to be so indiscriminate and so acceptive of anything that comes
24:53 -  as being somehow from the Lord because it ostensibly celebrates him and therefore mutes your spirit
25:03 -  and dulls it and makes you less capable on the next occasion for being able to discern
25:09 -  between soul and spirit until you're finally taken up as a soulish enterprise
25:15 -  and become a functionary in it yourself. Because of my calling I'm jealous to keep the integrity
25:27 -  of my inner man and of my spirit. But you know what that means? It means sticking out like the proverbial sore thumb
25:34 -  while everybody else is celebrating and falling out of their seats or crying or laughing
25:40 -  you're sitting there like a dum-dum. Completely unmoved because it has not touched your spirit.
25:49 -  And you're not going to open to something that offers itself as being in the realm of spirit when it's soul
25:57 -  and therefore you'll remain unmoved looking unspiritual. There's a price to pay for integrity
26:09 -  for guarding your spirit and your heart. And if you're not willing to pay it you'll be caught up with the whole stream
26:18 -  and be less able to discern its character and finally be participant in it. I have not sent these prophets.
26:30 -  Do you love the word sent? Do you know that it's the root of apostolos? If it's not sent, my dear saints
26:38 -  if it's self-initiated if a man picks himself up and goes and speaks, my God
26:44 -  the world is full of claptrap and noise and gift of gab and this is the most voluble of all ages.
26:51 -  There's never been such a sea of talking and words and profusion of writings and mailings
26:58 -  and we're swimming in it. But where is the man who is sent? And sent with a word that has its auspices
27:10 -  from the throne of heaven and is the now present truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
27:16 -  God did not send these men but they ran. Think of the arrogance of this.
27:24 -  God has not sent you. You would think you would come with a certain kind of timidity
27:28 -  and dare to express yourself but they come running because the whole tempo of the church
27:36 -  is running. There's a mechanics. There's something that has to go on
27:42 -  with a certain velocity, a certain speed a certain momentum. I always wonder about these speakers
27:47 -  that when they're called on they run up to the platform and they're right on the spot
27:52 -  and happy and buoyant and ready to go. What's wrong with me? I'm a snail.
28:01 -  My heart sinks when I hear I'm being called upon. The last thing is to come up
28:06 -  to the holy desk and open your mouth before God's people
28:11 -  let alone his ministers and in his name. I can't understand how they can run.
28:17 -  The very fact that they run is ipso facto evidence that they're not sent.
28:23 -  Why can't we wait? Why can't we allow a moment of interlude in between the end of the worship service
28:31 -  so called and the commencement of the speaker? No. There can't be a moment's silence allowed
28:36 -  lest the congregation be distracted or bored. There's a tempo that is so fixed and you're guilty for it.
28:50 -  You've not blown the whistle. You've not called the halt. You've gone with the rhythm
28:57 -  and it's antithetical to waiting on God. It's antithetical to receiving a word from God that you might be sent.
29:09 -  There's something wrong with running and we need to recognize that. I have not spoken to them
29:17 -  yet they prophesied. Audacity. Better if they would have said
29:25 -  this is my opinion. After some reflection I'm offering these comments for your consideration
29:32 -  but I don't presume to say that God has given me this statement that this is a thus saith the Lord.
29:39 -  Dear Saints, in the day that we allow men to use that kind of vocabulary and punctuate their speakings
29:48 -  by freely employing the name of the Lord to sanction it as having been given when it was not given
30:00 -  then the church is at its end. We're at the age of apostasy and fallenness when we allow such license
30:10 -  such unmitigated liberty as for men to take the name of the Lord on their lips so as to authorize, sanctify,
30:23 -  validate something that had its issuance only in themselves and never came from God but freely punctuate their statements
30:32 -  by saying thus saith the Lord or the Lord saith or the Lord told me. And you sat there like a bunch of dummies
30:40 -  and swallowed that and you don't know what a price you paid for that indulgence and for that condescension.
30:47 -  You should have gotten up and shrieked and cried out and blowed the whistle and say this far no further.
30:53 -  Not another word. You're desecrating the faith and the name of God from which you will not recover
31:01 -  if this becomes a practice and a standard that others will equally follow as playing the game.
31:09 -  You'll make of the faith a game, a charade. The church is the pillar of truth not a piece of flim flam
31:19 -  that reflects the low standard of the world only employing another vocabulary. Where's your jealousy?
31:27 -  They ran. They don't know Him but they're quick to employ Him
31:33 -  in a utilitarian sense as if He's a commodity. Can you believe that? To traffic in God
31:40 -  and to use Him as an endorsement for something that has its origins out of your own soul and humanity?
31:48 -  He's not a commodity. He's the most high. The church is in lamentable condition, saints
31:56 -  even in its best forms because we have tolerated such practices and in fact have indulged in ourselves.
32:04 -  This first fallen internationally renowned prophet is only a first statement of God
32:12 -  and it'll not end there before He unravels the entire fiasco and fraud and makes it known.
32:23 -  So we need to understand and examine and be critical of the condition at which we have come.
32:30 -  Kind of system, the tempo of services and the fear to allow there to be a moment's silence that is not filled by some activity.
32:39 -  Something is already wrong by its very nature that we have come to that kind of condition. That we cannot tolerate silence
32:48 -  with the God who says be still and know that I am God. And there's so little occasion to be still.
32:56 -  The religion demands activity, momentum. And we're practitioners and we're doing it. And think we're doing God a service.
33:07 -  So God saved us from staggering presumption and arrogance. And the heck of it is this.
33:15 -  How is it that we did not discern this arrogance and presumption in these internationally renowned
33:22 -  oracles and men of faith for the hour? Dum da dum dum. It's not just they that are the object
33:31 -  of God's disfavor, but we who have sat there like dummies and have applauded them
33:38 -  and run to hear them so that we can get a personal prophecy and be assured that God knows us.
33:45 -  Because the prophecy indicates details that can only be known to God or to the devil.
33:52 -  But we want so much to hear and have our ears tickled. And maybe there's an experience of some kind
33:59 -  which we desperately need because of the grayness of the church and its terrible predictability
34:04 -  that needs to be alleviated by something of a sensational kind that can be experienced.
34:12 -  So already the trap is set by the need to have ourselves confirmed before God by some man of the hour
34:20 -  who can give us a personal word of prophecy and assure us that God knows us. Thank you, Lord.
34:26 -  I didn't know that you knew me till I heard. Whatever happened to be accepted
34:33 -  in the beloved that does not need this kind of dubious and questionable confirmation
34:39 -  that comes from questionable personal prophecy that might well be more clairvoyance than it is the gift of spirit.
34:46 -  I'm getting at the root of the matter, you dear saints. This is not a finished message.
34:52 -  This is a guy who's gotten a bleary eye this morning without sufficient time to prepare
34:58 -  and trusting the Lord that I'm fool enough just to open my mouth
35:04 -  and believe that his heart is finding expression. Because I don't give a rat about my reputation.
35:12 -  What reputation? Or the esteem or the acceptance of the congregation or any such consideration
35:19 -  and that permits me a vast freedom to be his fool. May you come to that freedom
35:25 -  although the system does not encourage it. So, what is the thought of his heart? The intent of his mind?
35:33 -  Who has known it, known him that they can say with confidence he has sent me?
35:39 -  Thus saith the Lord. But if they had stood in my counsel verse 22
35:44 -  and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from the evil way and from the evil of their doings.
35:50 -  Now don't think that this means to turn them from pornography and vile
35:56 -  sensual practices but the evil means the evil of self-initiated
36:02 -  humanisms in whatever form even that which seems honorific
36:08 -  and moral and ethical and religious and even Christian. It's wicked
36:14 -  because it does not issue from God but from man. Let the unrighteous
36:20 -  how does this say it? Let the wicked man forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
36:26 -  It's not because his thoughts are pornographic it's unrighteous because they are his thoughts they're human thoughts
36:32 -  even when they're religious that makes them unrighteous because the only righteous thoughts
36:38 -  comes from a righteous God. And so these prophets who themselves are exhibiting their own humanity
36:44 -  which is evil. See of course I'm giving you a prophetic interpretation. You understand what I'm saying?
36:50 -  Which is always more black and white always more intense always focused more intensely
36:56 -  because you would never have interpreted the word evil here in the way that I'm suggesting it to you.
37:02 -  You don't even see it as evil because you yourself are conducting yourself in quite that way.
37:08 -  You don't see that what issues from man isn't in its essence evil.
37:14 -  It's unrighteous all the more because God says forsake your thoughts
37:20 -  and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and you can have my thoughts if you'll only forfeit
37:26 -  and put away your own but to persist in your thought is wicked it's evil
37:32 -  when you celebrate your thought and have no need for my own. And what is worse
37:38 -  even to interpret that thought as being God's
37:44 -  when it had its issuance and its origin in yourself and maybe even from below.
37:50 -  But your condition is so poor that if it comes in spiritual
37:56 -  terms or it quotes scripture that's enough to you to validate it
38:02 -  as being God. Spirituality is the last hiding place of self.
38:10 -  Had they stood in my council and had caused people to hear my words
38:16 -  then they would have turned from the evil way from the evil of their doings. It's evil because
38:22 -  it's their doings even when it's a project or a program or something
38:28 -  ostensibly to serve the purposes of God in which we liberally use the phrase his kingdom.
38:34 -  If it has its origin in man and from below it's evil it's wicked, it's unrighteous
38:40 -  it's theirs not mine and these false prophets who are active
38:46 -  out of themselves are modeling something for the church to emulate
38:52 -  which is altogether not God. So can any hide himself in secret
38:58 -  places that I should not see him? You know what the astonishment is? That men can speak
39:04 -  and act and do and not think that they are being observed of God
39:10 -  that somehow they can get away with it, that the Lord is not attentive on that day.
39:16 -  We're not like Paul who always lived in the conscious sense of the judge
39:22 -  and the day of judgment and that we shall be held accountable for every idle word that we speak
39:28 -  and that all that we have done in our bodies both good and bad will one day come
39:34 -  before us when we stand before the judgment of God. We lack a consciousness
39:40 -  of God actually as present and seeing and observing not only
39:46 -  the things that we say and do but even the condition of our secret heart when it's silent.
39:52 -  You got that picture? Am I commending some kind of legalism and rob you of
39:58 -  your charismatic freedom and bring you into some kind of constraint that God is always there seeing
40:04 -  and knowing? I'll tell you dear saints, the greatest malady of the church today is the lack of
40:10 -  the fear of God as God. There is no awe, no sense of fear, no deep respect
40:16 -  that he's a living God and seeing and a knowing God and we can't get away with our little
40:21 -  gitchy goo and cutting corners as if he does not observe it. The remarkable thing is
40:27 -  he lets it go on and he's silent and we assume that either he has condoned it
40:33 -  or he's not seen it until the day comes that we find ourselves not only into homosexuality
40:39 -  but also into alcoholism. It catches up with us. We're not communicating the sense
40:45 -  of God which is the function, the first primary function of foundational men
40:51 -  who are apostles and prophets is not their cleverness to resolve church difficulties and
40:57 -  disputes, it's to communicate in themselves the sense of God as he in fact is as God.
41:03 -  They should trail clouds of glory with them something about themselves their stateliness, their
41:09 -  stature, how they walk, they talk, their eyes, their demeanor as men who have come out of God's
41:15 -  presence, who know him who have waited upon him and whose meekness and
41:21 -  humility which no man can obtain by any practice is transmuted
41:27 -  into them by the intimacy of the fellowship with him in his sufferings.
41:33 -  We're seeing shallow pieces of goods, of men without histories in God
41:39 -  who have no origins in the church and in the body. Johnny Come Lately's boom and
41:45 -  they obtain international renown it doesn't take much in the public relations game
41:51 -  it has to be resisted or a Jewish man like myself who was
41:57 -  better looking earlier but always vocal and
42:03 -  even eloquent, hey a man like that can go far. If you can promote a nothing
42:09 -  who is, what shall I say lacks any solidity
42:15 -  any tensile strength, any any quality of life and history
42:21 -  and make of him the oracle of the hour. What can you do with the cats
42:27 -  if he will allow you? So Moish Rosen the head of Jews for Jesus who
42:33 -  drafted me out of public school teaching and was my instructor in being a missionary to the Jews
42:39 -  prophesied, by the time you're 50 Art you will be the Jewish Billy Graham.
42:45 -  I saw him recently I said you know you missed it. I'm now 75 and I've
42:51 -  yet to become the Jewish Billy Graham. I don't think I ever will. Well he said it's not that I was wrong in my prophesy
42:57 -  you could have become it he said if you played your cards right.
43:03 -  But you fool you went to Minnesota up into the boondocks where
43:09 -  even the travel agents can't find it on the map. And you were there for 30
43:15 -  years in total obscurity and hiddenness in the sub-arctic zone whose temperatures are colder than Alaska
43:21 -  because you felt that the spirit of God said to you end time teaching
43:27 -  center community refuge and acted on that still small voice
43:33 -  you intuited such a whisper that if you had chosen not to hear it the Lord would not have
43:39 -  disqualified you and would have allowed you to be the greatest success Jewishly than you have become.
43:45 -  What are we hearing? What are we allowing to be heard?
43:51 -  When it calls us to sacrifice and to suffering
43:57 -  to humiliation community refuge. Community?
44:03 -  Hey I want to retain the aura of the man of the hour under the anointing of God from the platform
44:09 -  but what is it going to be when I'm living with the same people intensely and intimately
44:15 -  not just on Sunday but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday aren't there going to be occasions
44:21 -  when my clay feet will be revealed? Aren't there going to see the displeasure of my wife
44:27 -  and the mistreatment of my children or the celebration of my dogs over that of the body of Christ?
44:33 -  It's only a matter of time before you'll be found out cats and be humiliated
44:39 -  because you cannot retain that aura of the anointed man publicly when you're living
44:45 -  with the same people day in and day out in all the vicissitudes of life that are especially
44:51 -  demanding in community but it's the greatest provision that God has ever made for me
44:57 -  and saved me from being phony baloney and being a hothouse flower and flitting from one
45:03 -  holiday into the other as God's prophet for the hour Hey there's a price paid
45:11 -  if you're getting any value out of what I'm speaking because what I'm speaking is what I am
45:17 -  and that's what a prophet is called to be the thing in himself not a promulgator
45:23 -  a mouthpiece with a gift of gab and a little glitzy aura that
45:29 -  captivates the shallow and the carnal who want to emulate and become just like that
45:35 -  but don't want to go to northern Minnesota to obtain it or any other comparable form
45:41 -  of self denial let alone suffering and if we'll not hear that call for ourselves
45:47 -  what then shall we hear for anyone and what then shall we speak
45:53 -  but what is current what is in season what is the contemporary fad
45:59 -  that everybody else is speaking and seems to be so widely accepted and popular
46:05 -  I'm against the prophets that use their tongues and say he's saith I'm against them
46:11 -  that steal my words everyone from his neighbor that have not gotten it directly from me
46:17 -  and authentically from the throne but gotten it second hand from another who gets it second
46:23 -  hand from that one who gets it second hand second hand second hand it's merchandise
46:29 -  it's no longer the holy word of God it's become what is current and popular and in season
46:35 -  I will obtain the applause of God's people and their indulgent
46:43 -  honorariums to allow a lifestyle that is appropriate and becoming to the man of the ally
46:49 -  what would have been more appropriate would have been voluntary poverty they steal from
46:55 -  each other they've never gotten it from me because they're not in the council of the Lord they don't even know how to
47:01 -  get into that council even if time were provided as I've mentioned their very disposition is not amenable
47:07 -  to waiting on the Lord and seeking him and being heard of him their sense
47:13 -  people they need to feel something of the presence of God and if it's not forthcoming
47:19 -  in the devotional time how long will that devotion be maintained will that God test us
47:25 -  and withhold the sense of his presence to see if we will be faithful and abiding to
47:31 -  seek him early daily and not just with the utility that I need a message
47:37 -  for tonight but because he's God and deserves this devotion in himself
47:43 -  and if we don't recognize that and are unwilling to give ourselves to that and are only willing
47:49 -  to come in hope of getting something that can serve our purposes we're in the spirit of the world
47:55 -  the utilitarian spirit of Singapore and not in the kingdom of God at all
48:01 -  because you'll know when you'll have God's word it's like a fire it's like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces
48:07 -  people were shaking last night but our prayer this morning was
48:13 -  through the night hours and even today that word that went forth that was your
48:19 -  word will continue as a hammer upon the rock because you have no idea how hard
48:25 -  the hearts of God's people are how calcified how hardened
48:31 -  that word has got to beat and beat be called be brought again to their recall
48:37 -  and have its work until there's a breaking if it's easy to be received and only brings us
48:43 -  a few chuckles an enjoyable moment and is biblically valid and doctrinally
48:49 -  sound and we go home no different than when we came that's a nice message but it's not
48:55 -  the word of God that breaks that's a fire it's something that we've
49:01 -  obtained that we know which way the wind is blowing and what's appropriate to speak that will be found
49:07 -  acceptable against them verse 32 that prophesy false dreams say the Lord and
49:13 -  do tell them well one way you can know that they're false is the rush to tell them
49:19 -  and publish it and then in hardback and becomes a bestseller and when you get to Yugoslavia
49:25 -  they're even printing it off the Xerox machine and stapling it together and telling you that
49:31 -  this is the best thing that has ever come since the Bible if it was that holy that sacred
49:37 -  that much of vision that much of a visit into the ethereal and heavenly realms
49:43 -  keep it to yourself you don't publish it because it's by nature
49:49 -  sensational and will guarantee sales and celebrate you as a man
49:55 -  of uncommon vision and even the sent one to be the commander in chief of the body of Christ and to hear
50:01 -  Paul's apology in your visit that he had made grievous mistakes in the course of his apostolic career
50:07 -  which of course you will not make when you return and take the place that God has appointed
50:13 -  for you as commander in chief our Christian bestsellers do condemn
50:19 -  us better to be obscure and hidden and unknown
50:25 -  better to keep the deep revelations of God that were personal to yourself
50:31 -  and only such time as the Spirit of God would give you liberty to express it
50:37 -  but never to become a bestseller they publish it the Lord says
50:43 -  their so called dreams and cause my people to err by their lies and by their
50:49 -  lightness well you dear saints I can't do anything
50:55 -  more for you but if I could inoculate you with what is in my own spirit to despise
51:01 -  lightness you know what every time I've gone out of my way to hear these great figures
51:07 -  the one abiding impression that I get every time is the lightness of the proceeding
51:13 -  it's jocular it's informal it's humorous it's cute
51:19 -  yes there's a word given it's only a little homily to get to the real thing which is
51:27 -  the gift of prophecy of a personal kind the word is only a little thing just to get that out of the way it's not
51:33 -  the word of God it's only a little biblical homily and the whole atmosphere is light
51:39 -  well I'm not a Hebrew scholar but the word for glory
51:45 -  in Hebrew kavod is the same word for weight and the word
51:51 -  for light is the same word for curse and we need to despise lightness
51:57 -  it's unbecoming to the church it's contradictory
52:03 -  to the whole tenor of faith and those that have gone before us and those
52:09 -  and the thing toward which we're pointing to the consummation of the ages is full of weight
52:15 -  full of significance full of exclamation of the apostle Paul oh the depth of the riches
52:21 -  both of the wisdom and knowledge of God who has been his counselor men who have seen and understood
52:27 -  the mysteries of God and have been its stewards weight is intrinsic to the faith and when the church
52:33 -  is characterized by its lightness rather than by its weight and by its glory we're already in the place of
52:39 -  prophecy because lightness is to be enjoyed and weight brings responsibility
52:45 -  contemplation the implications the call the sacrifice the prospect
52:51 -  of suffering because glory never comes except to first be
52:57 -  preceded by suffering we prefer lightness it makes no requirement
53:03 -  and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet I sent
53:09 -  them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all
53:15 -  and that's why we're fixed that's why we don't go on from faith to faith and glory to
53:21 -  glory that's why immaturity is the abiding characteristic of the congregations
53:27 -  of God's people we don't see growth maturity
53:33 -  the lightness itself militates against that because I
53:39 -  did not send them nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all it's not profitable they have
53:45 -  perverted in verse 36 the words of the living God of the Lord of hosts our God
53:51 -  they have perverted even in the name of the Lord to debase the word of God
53:57 -  to diminish the sense of God and the end thereof
54:03 -  is the trivialization of the faith itself the church becomes predictable
54:11 -  the faith is a Sunday addendum the Christianity is a culture
54:17 -  and not the apostolic presence whose very presence turns the world upside down
54:23 -  brings into question those spurious values to which all mankind subscribe
54:29 -  that are lies God is being trivialized in his faith
54:35 -  by the most notable of ministers and we share in that culpability
54:41 -  for we have endorsed them we have sent for them we have given them our platforms
54:47 -  we get excited when they come and we arrange the biggest extravagances and
54:53 -  somehow we don't even take note that they don't really bring a substantial and oracular word
54:59 -  allegories and high sounding prophecies of this nation relating to that nation
55:05 -  that cannot be confirmed but has an aura of suggestion of something which is good enough for us
55:11 -  one of these men little tales out of school whom I recently went to visit and to hear
55:19 -  and one message was enough but I also had occasion to hear the
55:25 -  traveling companion an African with a real hyped up
55:31 -  presentation of a kind of rah-rah kind that you would expect at a football rally
55:37 -  but he's a doctor and so I couldn't wait fast enough to get him to say
55:43 -  where did you get your doctorate? I knew where at a diploma mill
55:49 -  five hundred dollar check and an essay will do it because all of your previous service will be counted
55:55 -  as filling the requirement of study
56:03 -  that you need not perform because your service serves that end
56:09 -  so now you're a doctor well I have enough academic background to esteem
56:17 -  significant titles when they are earned and doctors indeed do deserve
56:23 -  our respect if not our reverence if they are doctors in the faith
56:29 -  that have studied and broken their heads and agonized and wrestled with original languages
56:35 -  and come up with holy ghost directed insight and revelation of value to the church
56:41 -  the great theologians like Karl Barth whom I admire greatly that's a suffering
56:47 -  for them the title is appropriate and they themselves don't celebrate it there's a cheapie who wants a little
56:53 -  punctuation at the end of his name because it'll mean more invitations because this is a doctor
56:59 -  can you understand dear saints to take a man like that with you in your ministry
57:05 -  and not understand that it's essentially fraudulent and to
57:11 -  sig him on God's people to fill up the empty space that you don't have to do all the speaking
57:17 -  what does that signify in the character and the integrity of the man
57:23 -  who takes such a one as to travel with him and to speak
57:29 -  this I'm speaking symbolically
57:37 -  you have to understand what these things represent lest we ourselves be enticed
57:43 -  and induced and seduced and ourselves covet such titles and such honors and such recognition
57:51 -  and make that a cheapie because the end thereof is everlasting
57:57 -  reproach in verse 40 I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you
58:03 -  and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten go ahead and have your
58:09 -  day in the sun and be celebrated as God's man of the hour in a title totally
58:15 -  undeserved and banquet in it and take all of the honor and all of the
58:21 -  honorariums that go with it but the day will come and you'll have to stand before me
58:27 -  and what you'll receive from me then will be everlasting reproach and a perpetual shame
58:33 -  which shall not be forgotten where is your sense of eternal judgment
58:39 -  where is your fear of having to carry into eternity the lack of integrity
58:45 -  with which you allowed yourself to conduct yourself in this life
58:51 -  why didn't you consider what comes after why don't you
58:57 -  understand that this life is preparatory for that which follows that is eternal
59:03 -  why haven't you taken eternity into your consideration you might then have hesitated
59:09 -  and not been so quick to run and speak that which God had not given your failure is the failure
59:15 -  to understand eternity and the eternal God and eternal judgment and eternal reproach
59:21 -  or you would not have acted so lightly and in doing so
59:27 -  you're robbing the church of the sense of significance of the things that are eternal
59:33 -  so that they too will have a certain liberty to conduct themselves in a way less than they ought
59:39 -  because we're not aware of eternal consequence which is not to understand
59:45 -  God as God for our every failure comes back to that lack
59:51 -  that our every error is we don't know God as we ought
59:57 -  and we're perpetuating that kind of shallow conception and not encouraging God's
01:00:03 -  people to seek him and be fond of him and to know him as he in fact is so we need to ask
01:00:11 -  and examine ourselves to see if we're in the faith what faith are we in?
01:00:17 -  the shabby counterfeit of present decisional Christianity
01:00:23 -  have we come through the narrow gate have we come with trembling
01:00:29 -  does trembling characterize our present relationship with God and before his people
01:00:35 -  are we sons and daughters of the resurrection who live out of resurrection faith and life or merely subscribe to the doctrine
01:00:41 -  as being correct and think we're doing God's service we're living out of ourselves
01:00:47 -  and by ourselves out of our own unaided humanity and doing an impressive job of it
01:00:53 -  having no need for resurrection life because we have reduced the church to such predictable proportions
01:00:59 -  that it doesn't need the vastness of God's spirit and power we can quite perform it ourselves
01:01:05 -  reducing the great issue of death and resurrection merely to a doctrine to approve
01:01:11 -  when it's at death to be obtained because
01:01:17 -  the call of God is beyond our ability. Do you know that? With man it is impossible
01:01:23 -  and if it's possible for you you're promulgating another faith it's not the faith of Paul
01:01:29 -  it's not the faith of the prophets it's not the faith of the psalmists it's some cheapy contemporary
01:01:35 -  equivalent thereof but it is not the faith that honors the God of glory
01:01:41 -  the creator of heaven and earth the consummate God the high priest
01:01:47 -  of our profession the soon coming king if you can do it, you're in error
01:01:59 -  we're called to that which is beyond ourselves we're called to ultimacy and until we shall find it
01:02:05 -  and obtain it, how shall we move Jews to jealousy? what shall they be jealous?
01:02:11 -  if we're only replicating what they themselves can perform in their own synagogues
01:02:17 -  without the holy spirit they've got to see something larger than life, something transcendent
01:02:23 -  something that issues from heaven that cannot be understood as coming from man that means the death
01:02:29 -  to all that is human all that's religious and the coming alive
01:02:35 -  and the purposes of God by the fulfillment of that which he gives
01:02:41 -  who raises the dead I'm trusting for that this morning and even praying, excuse my
01:02:49 -  little Jewish naivety that I would not only be an expositor but a demonstration
01:02:55 -  of the very life to which you yourself are called and that you're hearing a sent word
01:03:01 -  from a sent man that requires Lord
01:03:07 -  join me in prayer Lord your forgiveness, we pray
01:03:13 -  because we're sensing even when we're right, we're wrong and then the things
01:03:19 -  that we have most celebrated are the reasons for our deepest repentance
01:03:25 -  the fact that we have celebrated them is itself an indictment we have not understood
01:03:33 -  Lord, we don't know you as we ought and we're promulgating something of a God
01:03:39 -  of another kind augmented by our sound systems, the technology
01:03:45 -  of our age to create feelings, emotions sensation
01:03:51 -  we're lazy we're too busy to seek you
01:03:57 -  our schedule will not allow and even if it did, we would have no disposition we wouldn't know what to do if we stopped running
01:04:03 -  we don't know what it means to stand still and know that I am God
01:04:09 -  that I am that I am is a gift that I will confer
01:04:15 -  to you if you will only be still but the nature of the whole religious system
01:04:21 -  militates against that stillness, it calls for running so my God, do we have the courage
01:04:29 -  to bring that system to an end the very fact that it is
01:04:35 -  system is itself a condemnation and that the only difference
01:04:41 -  is that someone does a little better than the other guy, but it's the same predictable thing
01:04:47 -  we have lost the spontaneity of God and the sense of God and the originality
01:04:53 -  of God who is a creator still we mimic and imitate one another in our
01:04:59 -  worship songs and services and speakings where a culture would
01:05:05 -  and not the vast and profound thing that is life saving
01:05:11 -  that needs to break into the world of falsity and lies that purports to be true to which men give
01:05:17 -  their energy and time and have no sense of what is eternal or what will be judged
01:05:23 -  because we ourselves have not conveyed it, because we ourselves do not adequately know it
01:05:29 -  and we ourselves are not living in the consciousness of it and serving out of that
01:05:35 -  Lord forgive us my God forgive us forgive our professionalism
01:05:41 -  you forgive our secret desire to be called doctor, to be honored
01:05:47 -  to be acknowledged to succeed on the basis and standards that are contemporary
01:05:53 -  that we've lost that sense and connection with what is ancient what was original
01:05:59 -  what came before the holy men of old we're not in the conscious continuum
01:06:05 -  with those who suffered and bled and died for your name and for your honor, we don't have a sufficient
01:06:11 -  anticipation of the eschatological climax of the age the glory of your kingdom and your coming
01:06:17 -  or realize that it's hebraic, that it waits for a greater David who alone can
01:06:23 -  occupy that throne from the holy hill of Zion out of which shall go forth the law
01:06:29 -  of the Lord to all nations Lord forgive us we've even traduced and
01:06:35 -  deprecated the word kingdom and made it a little cheapy as if it's a kind of interior
01:06:41 -  personal subjective thing rather than the awesome theocratic rule of God
01:06:47 -  over his own creation through restored Israel Lord we're shallow
01:06:53 -  mercy upon us my God for what we have endorsed what we have favored, what we have
01:06:59 -  encouraged, what we have emulated what have been the models of our time give us a day of
01:07:05 -  new beginnings Lord, we're willing to forfeit our best success if it has
01:07:11 -  any auspices and origin out of ourselves and not from you help us to despise what is light
01:07:23 -  and to have a heart only for that which bears the weight and the glory of God
01:07:29 -  which comes at price and we thank you and praise you that you've given us an occasion
01:07:35 -  like this that could have been a cutesy occasion, a little ra-ra time, a little good feeling
01:07:41 -  a little cheap equivalent of what is prophetic if one will play the game
01:07:47 -  but you slipped one in on us and sent us the real thing my God
01:07:55 -  we bless you for a love that will not let us go will not allow us
01:08:01 -  to play games, will not allow us to make a sham of the faith and turn a holy calling
01:08:07 -  into a career or a profession forgive us my God to any degree to which that has come
01:08:15 -  into our being may we spit it out, may we vomit it up may we be as dead men
01:08:21 -  that don't know how to walk and have to go back to square one
01:08:27 -  begin all over to learn what it means to be the servants of the most high who can find
01:08:33 -  your counsel in the holy place, in the secret place hear it and speak it without
01:08:39 -  fear who don't have to send their people home happy can send them home
01:08:45 -  agitated, restless, disquieted and trust you through the night hours to perform
01:08:51 -  that interior work where the word breaks as the hammer upon the rock and the word
01:08:57 -  is fire in the bones I will have a result of a kind that cannot be measured
01:09:03 -  my God help us to forsake the idols of this age
01:09:09 -  the cheapy stereotypes, the easy glib facile shallow thing
01:09:15 -  that pervades your church that is in many ways less than the world's profundity
01:09:21 -  the world is more serious in its academic endeavors than we are in the faith
01:09:27 -  bless you Lord give us by your mercy a spirit of repentance and breaking
01:09:33 -  not a deeper consecration that we can perform but a bringing down into the dust of death
01:09:39 -  that only you can perform for the one who slays makes alive thank you for the word
01:09:45 -  that cuts and heals, thank you for the word that kills and makes alive we receive it my God
01:09:51 -  as purest mercy give us the grace also to speak it on the occasions that you will require
01:09:57 -  we thank you for the high calling of God in Christ Jesus to which we
01:10:03 -  yield ourselves anew, repentantly in Jesus name Amen
