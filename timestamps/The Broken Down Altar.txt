The Broken Down Altar

00:00 -  Total political, economic, and social systems like Nazism, Fascism, Communism. I need to hear that again. What?
00:10 -  I need to hear that again. Okay, what does that word mean? What does that word mean?
00:20 -  Totalitarianism. Totalitarianism. It is a 20th century word.
00:25 -  It is a word from the 20th century. It did not exist before our century. But it is enormously significant.
00:36 -  What does it mean? The advent or the coming to pass of total economic, political, and social systems. Nazism, Fascism, Communism.
00:58 -  I don't want to give you a political analysis of these conditions. I only want to suggest a spiritual interpretation. And really isn't the spiritual interpretation the true interpretation?
01:21 -  Because all issues are in the last analysis the issue of spirit. You will never understand Nazism if you eliminate the spiritual perception. It was a spiritist and occultist phenomenon.
01:49 -  Though it expressed itself governmentally, and socially, politically, and militarily. But here is the point I want to stress. How is it that it was this century that saw the rise of these great totalitarian systems?
02:14 -  What is the fundamental spiritual explanation? In my opinion, it came because of a vacuum in the lives of modern men. That their conventional lives could not fill.
02:34 -  That this should take place in Germany. The country of Luther and the Protestant Reformation is a stunning statement. The kind that should stun us.
02:52 -  The kind that should stun us. Because that Christianity became in modern times only a Sunday culture. A polite respectability.
03:13 -  And did not totally engage the total lives of men. Many of us are still affected by such perceptions. We have been born and have been brought up and have come to maturity in a world that practices a conventional Christian Sunday culture.
03:45 -  And the only question has become how to improve it. Or how to renew it. Or to improve the quality of its meetings.
03:59 -  Or make the Sunday a more exciting experience. Or to create certain kinds of programs that will make it a more pleasant kind of experience. That is not radical enough.
04:17 -  It does not go far enough. Now I will give you a definition of what I think revival is. Revival is God's periodic attempt.
04:39 -  To bring the Church of Jesus Christ back. To bring the Church of Jesus Christ back. To its original purity.
04:49 -  And to its apostolic reality. I want that to sink in. I am giving you my opinion.
05:05 -  But I believe it is also God's opinion. The first church, the apostolic glory, was not just something we should look upon sentimentally or historically. It is God's norm.
05:25 -  Intended throughout all generations. It says in Ephesians unto him be glory in the church. By Christ Jesus.
05:41 -  World without end. Throughout all ages. Unto him be glory in the church.
05:53 -  A church that is not a glory unto him. Is not the church. It has become something else.
06:03 -  Even though it still uses the same vocabulary. And uses the same traditional titles and categories. I attended a conference on the Holocaust in Minneapolis.
06:21 -  Sponsored by Christian and Jewish theologians. Very interesting. I only remember one thing from it.
06:33 -  The rest was mere ceremony. Mere play acting. And by the way everything that I have just now said.
06:45 -  Also describes church practice itself. Mere play acting. That is the meaning of the word hypocrite.
06:59 -  It is a play actor. There was only one memorable moment that came out of that conference. A true man got up.
07:11 -  He happened to be a Protestant theologian. And he said, do we have the courage to face the questions which the Holocaust has raised? It has taken 40 years for Germany to be able to even consider again this event.
07:39 -  He said these are the questions that we must consider. Where was the church when the Nazi phenomenon began? Why was there not a spiritual reality of God?
07:59 -  That could stand against this antichrist and satanic spiritual phenomenon that rose with the Nazi movement. Instead, except for the exception of a few outstanding individuals like Dietrich Bonhoeffer. The entire church collapsed.
08:33 -  It had not the spiritual resources. It had not the strength and the stamina to stand against this great dark power.
08:47 -  He said we need to ask where was the church. And whether indeed it was the church at all. Or some western Christian culture.
08:59 -  Or what is worse, an apostate church. A church that has fallen away. Are you getting all this?
09:17 -  I want to raise this question myself. What has happened in the 40 years since the conclusion of World War II? To have radically altered the church of Jesus Christ in the world.
09:35 -  And if the church then was either a culture or apostate. What has happened since to have changed? Is it not still in that condition?
09:57 -  And that what we have applauded as charismatic renewal. Or Jesus movement. However impressive certain aspects of it are.
10:11 -  Have really not changed anything foundationally. We have not returned to apostolic foundation. Which is the reason why I delight in the word restoration.
10:29 -  More than the more popular word renewal. I don't want to renew that which is tired and is only a cultural weak religious form. I don't want to renew that which is tired and is only a cultural weak religious form.
10:49 -  I want to see restored the apostolic foundation. This is the first thing that the prophet Elijah did. When Israel halted between two opinions.
11:03 -  And then came the ultimate moment of confrontation on the Carmel. Do you remember this? The false prophets were able to do nothing.
11:19 -  They had also made their altar. And stretched out their sacrifice. And leaped and danced and cut themselves and did all kinds of frantic things.
11:27 -  But there was no answer from heaven. Now let this sink into your hearing. They really expected an answer.
11:41 -  They did not know that they were false prophets. They thought that they were actually in contact with a God. But in the moment of ultimate crisis and confrontation.
11:57 -  There was no answer. Neither was there any that heard. Well Art, what has that got to do with today?
12:07 -  Everything. Are you mature enough to understand this? That we could make of Jesus Christ a false religion?
12:21 -  That we could actually employ the vocabulary of Christianity? That we could actually employ the vocabulary of Christianity? But do it with so little comprehension.
12:39 -  Such an absence of an actual contact with the God whose name we are continually mouthing. That we have actually made of it a false religion and an idolatry. Which has become professionalized through false prophets.
12:59 -  And has become a religious system that pervades the entire earth. And has become a religious system that pervades the entire earth. But when the ultimate moment of crisis comes.
13:15 -  And people shall call on that God in that same way. Never really having known him. They can leap, they can dance, they can be frantic.
13:27 -  And they will be none to hear nor to answer. And it was worth my coming all this way to say these things. And I would despair having spoken them.
13:45 -  That there is no way that you can even understand me. And to see this as vision. Except God give you light from heaven.
14:03 -  It is interesting that the prophets were originally called seers. What did they see? They saw as God sees.
14:23 -  And this is what we also must do. How does God see present Christianity? Especially its more modern forms that have become frantic with leaping and with dancing.
14:39 -  And certainly the more modern forms that are full of jumping and dancing. These false prophets leaped upon their altar and cut themselves and gesticulated and made all kinds of motions. These false prophets who jumped on an altar and they cut themselves and they danced and did all kinds of movements.
14:55 -  But they could not compel an answer from God. But they could not get an answer from God. You know if you squint your eyes a little bit.
15:03 -  And take a look at Jesus rallies. And certain charismatic forms. And full gospel or pentacostal activities.
15:17 -  It would almost seem to be the same thing. Much frantic activity. Much noise and much commotion.
15:29 -  But it is not bringing an answer from heaven. And it never will. Until the altar of God is restored.
15:41 -  So what was the first thing that Elijah did? After he mocked the false prophets. He wasn't very polite.
15:53 -  He said maybe God is sleeping. The King James translators could not bring themselves actually to literally translate what the original manuscript says. Maybe your God is in the WC.
16:15 -  I like Elijah. He was a man without fear. Because the issue of the altar had been established with him.
16:35 -  We're coming to the point. The altar is the place of total sacrifice. It's not what we say come to the altar today as we talk in the Christian churches.
16:47 -  It's an invitation. You almost have to use a crowbar to get the people out of their seats. Or we use manipulations of techniques.
17:07 -  Or psychological devices. Or play upon their emotions. Or manipulate in one way or another.
17:17 -  So the people come. Or they wait like silent dummies. They're coming to the altar.
17:29 -  But they return to their seats. And they return to their homes. In exactly the same condition as they left them.
17:41 -  We need to understand what an altar is. It's a place of total sacrifice. And if it is not that.
17:55 -  Then God's fire will not fall. What is revival in its periodic expressions in the history of the church? The fire of God again with his people.
18:15 -  The glory of God filling the church. His people as a kingdom in the earth. A vibrant kind of reality.
18:27 -  That contradicts the kingdom of this present world in every point and particular. What is the character of the modern church? Even in its best charismatic form.
18:43 -  It's not contrary to the world in every point and particular. But like the world in every point and particular. The world uses its amplifiers.
18:55 -  Then we'll use ours. The world uses promotional methods and techniques. Then we'll show them we can use their methods.
19:09 -  And that we can even do it better than them. First class. King's kids.
19:17 -  Only we're promoting the kingdom. Not merchandise. But you can't promote the kingdom by using the world's methods.
19:33 -  I'll speak things to you that should be so clear. That you should yawn in my face and say, have you come all the way to say that? Who doesn't know that?
19:45 -  And everything I've said since I've begun this morning is of that character. But it's almost unknown to you. And certainly unknown to the church.
19:59 -  And certainly unknown to the church. But it's almost unknown to you. And certainly unknown to the church.
20:09 -  As for example this point. The world will use any means to accomplish its ends. But not so with the God who is holy.
20:23 -  God's means must ever and always be consonant with his ends. But only through his methods. Holy ends cannot be accomplished with carnal means.
20:41 -  God will not have it. You can leap and dance and yell and cry out. There will be no fire from heaven.
20:55 -  He is holy, holy, holy. Think of when Jesus came into Jerusalem. It's called the triumphal entry of the king.
21:11 -  It was the fulfillment of a precious messianic scripture. The book of Zechariah the ninth chapter. Thy king shall come to thee.
21:27 -  Low and humble. Where he rides upon the filth of a donkey. He shall never come in any other way.
21:39 -  Who says so, Cass? I say so. You can put it in your notes.
21:47 -  The king shall never come in any other way. And neither will his kingdom either. Because what is the kingdom?
21:57 -  But the king himself. Ripped large. Given expression in full.
22:05 -  Through his people. The king must always come. Lowly and meek.
22:13 -  For it is not the king. You want to be saved from end time deception? You want to be saved from end time deception?
22:23 -  When Peter shall come and say, I am the Christ, I am the Christ. Or look here, or look there. Or this is his ministry, or that is his ministry.
22:31 -  Or this is his ministry, or that is his ministry. Look at the signs, and look at the wonders. Look at the clouds, look at the response, look at the church of God.
22:37 -  Look at how the church is going. Look at this. The lowliness and the meekness of the Lamb.
22:43 -  The lowliness and the meekness of the Lamb. You can't imitate that. You can't produce it on the earth.
22:53 -  It simply is not to be found in natural man. Only in the king from heaven. Come learn of me here.
23:03 -  I am lowly and meek in heart. It's not some affectation that I'm putting on. It's not just something that he puts on.
23:15 -  And our spiritual discernment is so dull. We think if anyone puts on an act of, who me? I really don't deserve.
23:23 -  Please don't ask me to speak, I'm not a... We think that's meekness. But it is actually egotism.
23:35 -  And self in a reverse form. Do you know what the king did when he came into Jerusalem? He flew over the money changers' tables.
23:49 -  And he was still meek and lowly. And that's not meek. Are you converted?
23:59 -  That I have to explain every one of these things? If you were deeply converted, my explanations would not be necessary.
24:11 -  Because then you would know them. Intuitively and well. By the spirit of God that fills your life.
24:21 -  True meekness is not measured by when you defer... Oh, I don't know, I couldn't do that.
24:27 -  Where the lowliness is not described by just saying,
24:33 -  oh, I can't do that. Meekness, humility, lowliness and humility
24:39 -  is total dependence upon God. Moment by moment. For all of life.
24:51 -  And if that requires you to throw over tables, your obedience to that requirement is your humility. There will be times when you will
25:07 -  bleep like a lamb. But there are other times when you will roar like a lion.
25:17 -  It has not to do with your natural temperament or your own disposition. But what is
25:25 -  the lamb of God requiring in that moment? Are you following the lamb? With or so ever, think of?
25:37 -  Even into overthrowing tables. Even into mocking the false prophets.
25:47 -  Maybe your God is in the WC. Is a moment of humility. Because it was not Elijah's comment.
25:59 -  It was God's. To know this kind of humility. That you will never turn to yourself
26:07 -  for your own enablement or inspiration. But in the life of God,
26:17 -  moment by moment, this alone is humility. As God sees it.
26:25 -  By whose definitions do you live? The worlds or Gods? How do you define love?
26:35 -  Making nice? If you are that carnal, you will miss God. Especially in his judgment.
26:49 -  You say, God will never do that? He is a God of love. When his judgment is his love.
26:57 -  Oh children. The single greatest absence to be found
27:09 -  in the church today. Is the absence of judgment. We are unwilling to perform it.
27:23 -  We don't want to confront men. Or offend them. Or hurt their feelings.
27:35 -  It's a man pleasing system. Self serving. It is shot through with the spirit
27:47 -  from beginning to end. Because it has despised the altar of God.
27:57 -  And it has the spirit of the world in its heart. Which is
28:05 -  attending to the desires of men. More concerned to please men.
28:15 -  Than to please God. Don't defend anyone. They might leave the church.
28:21 -  And take their ties with them. It is a system. And I don't speak
28:37 -  from a critical mind. But I sit before God. As I stand before you.
28:45 -  Very conscious of my responsibility. Not to express some kind of personal opinion.
28:53 -  But to give God a mouth to project his own seeing. You must understand.
29:05 -  Or you will not recognize the necessity for revival. Of what God wants to restore.
29:15 -  And raising up the altar that has been broken down. It says about this ass
29:25 -  upon which Jesus sat. Jesus said, you go and you will find an ass
29:35 -  that is a crossroad where two roads meet. If anybody tries to stop you
29:45 -  tell him that the Lord has need of him. And he still does. He says you will find an ass
29:55 -  upon which never man sat. That is how pure it has got to be. God will never use anything
30:05 -  upon which man has sat. He is not going to use worldly promotional methods.
30:13 -  He does not need computers and inducements and all kinds of things to promote the church.
30:23 -  It may increase its numbers. But it does not increase the church. Can you even see the difference?
30:43 -  The church is his glory. And not a numerical accomplishment. Its success is not to be measured by its numbers.
31:01 -  Or the eloquence or smoothness of its ministers. Or the delight of its programs.
31:09 -  Or the impressiveness of its music or its choir. By one factor only.
31:19 -  The presence of his glory. His presence. Unto him be glory in the church.
31:33 -  We should spend the rest of the week on this one word. Glory.
31:43 -  If God could succeed with us in these days just to burn the meaning of this word into our spirit.
31:55 -  It will be the most valuable contribution that could ever be made to your life. Because if you have not the vision
32:05 -  for the glory of God. And the desire for it does not burn in your heart.
32:15 -  If it is not your foremost concern. You are not jealous for the glory of God. Neither are you a minister.
32:27 -  For the first requirement of true priesthood is a single-eyed jealousy. That unto him be the glory.
32:45 -  This is the first and foremost question. It is more important than saving the Jews. And I speak this as a Jew.
32:57 -  In fact I will say also that except there be glory in the church because God has ministers who are so jealous for
33:05 -  Jews will not be saved. It is the key to the salvation of Holland and the rest of this whole modern world.
33:21 -  To see again the glory of God in the earth. Because when the fire of God fell on Elijah's sacrifice
33:31 -  when the people saw it we are not speaking about some eerie ephemeral thing
33:37 -  some intangible category. When the people saw it they fell on their faces
33:49 -  and they cried out the glory is God! The glory is God!
33:59 -  Contrast present evangelism today. Will you accept Jesus? God has a plan for your life.
34:09 -  It will go well with you. Boyfriend or girlfriend? Does God take care of your body?
34:15 -  How are your finances? Need security? Accept him.
34:23 -  Ego-centric appealing to the self-centeredness of man rather than calling them to repentance
34:37 -  for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God!
34:53 -  No wonder that our evangelism is so anemic because our church is anemic. It is only a mere culture
35:07 -  and has lost the vision or has never had it for the glory of God.
35:19 -  Do you know what I find myself doing these days now so often? I've got to take the first half hour
35:27 -  at the beginning of meetings just to prepare the minds and the attitudes and the spirits
35:33 -  of those who are assembled. Because their expectancy is so low. They're only expecting a lecture
35:51 -  or a speaker or a novelty some mild curiosity
35:59 -  a message as we say but they're not expecting glory. They're expecting a meeting
36:11 -  and therefore they don't get an event how even the expectancy of God's people needs to be lifted
36:21 -  that we not limit the Holy One of Israel that we not limit the Holy One of Israel and be satisfied with less
36:31 -  than He Himself would desire to give us. I think many cowards would prefer meetings to events.
36:47 -  Because not only do I have to prepare them in the beginning but also in the end.
36:57 -  You'll be sorry that you were here. This will teach you just a cannot for curiosity here a Jewish speaker.
37:09 -  This meeting is going to cost you. You'll stand responsibly for God for that which you've heard.
37:19 -  This is not just a message given for your entertainment. This is a message given for your time. Whether you agree or disagree
37:31 -  or you can say I liked it or not or I like this style of speaker I don't like it's the very word of God from heaven
37:45 -  that has come as an event and you shall be held accountable for it. And now I'll give an invitation on the basis
37:55 -  of what God has spoken and I'm not going to call you to a mere altar call some sentimental gesture
38:07 -  some evangelistic device to conclude a meeting I'm calling you to the true altar of God the place of total sacrifice
38:19 -  the ending of yourself not only the things that are wrong but the whole sacrifice
38:31 -  God's fire will not fall unless it is good as well as it is bad all flesh
38:39 -  the total natural life you hope for the future and what you want to do for God
38:45 -  your intentions all it's a fearful moment
38:55 -  and those who respond to it know indeed that God was in it and everything has changed after that
39:05 -  new dealings from God new trials and difficulties things failing and going wrong
39:15 -  problems in marriage and in life an answer from God in the response to his invitation
39:27 -  that changes everything do you know what I'm saying children? every time that God's people come together
39:37 -  every time that a man stands before the people of God or an audience in the world it ought to be an event
39:47 -  come from God it's as from one who has been sent to go and tell and make
40:01 -  and if his word is not an event he's not incentive God the only meaning went
40:09 -  and the result therefore is not apostolic and that's what we have today a proliferation of ministries everywhere
40:19 -  but how many have been sent that's actually the root meaning of the Greek word apostolos
40:31 -  sent by God remember Acts the 13th chapter?
40:47 -  now there were in the church that was in Antioch precious beautiful words that describe the beginning of great apostolic adventures
41:07 -  a church that included men of apostolic character men and women of apostolic calling
41:21 -  and God spoke into that church by the Holy Ghost and said separate unto me Paul and Bonobus for the work which I have called them
41:33 -  can you imagine such a thing happening today? can you imagine such a thing happening today? the voice of God actually heard
41:41 -  speaking into the congregation not some questionable thing of some tongue or interpretation of prophecy
41:51 -  we can ask was it of man was it of God and the Lord spoke into the congregation and the Lord spoke into the congregation
42:07 -  it was so clear that the whole congregation heard for when they fasted and laid hands upon them so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went
42:23 -  can you imagine God equating the laying on of hands of men as being sent forth by the Holy Ghost so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went
42:37 -  so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost went what does the word so refer to? so they the church fasted and laid hands upon them
42:55 -  so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost and so the Holy Ghost said God equated the church in Antioch as God himself
43:11 -  laying on of hands of men in that church as the same as being sent forth by God himself now there were in the church that was in Antioch
43:27 -  a true church apostolic church is always the origin
43:41 -  of all apostolic deeds these were the ones who put the world upside down this is a definition of an apostolic act
43:53 -  that begins with the word now there were in the church of Antioch a locality in the earth
44:05 -  a diversity of believers who were in that locality who were in such a burning intensity of relationship together that when the Holy Ghost spoke
44:19 -  they were fasting and ministering unto the Lord they were black and white they were Jew and Gentile
44:31 -  they were men of diverse nationalities and origins but they were the church not a Sunday social club
44:45 -  the quality of their life was apostolic and so were the men that it produced it doesn't say now they were at the church in Antioch
45:01 -  now they were in the church that was in Antioch they didn't just attend the church they were in the church
45:19 -  they were the church they belonged to each other they were organically connected by the Spirit of God
45:31 -  they were a total people totally given to God together anything less than that is subnormal
45:45 -  and what revival is is the breakthrough of God to restore a sleeping Christian culture
45:59 -  satisfied with mere services with predictable Sundays to bring them back to the apostolic glory
46:13 -  that is revival and it is a condition in which the church should continually live that's why Elijah first rebuilt the altar
46:29 -  twelve stones for each of the tribes of Israel not just that which pertains to the Baptist or the Evangelical not just that which pertains to the Baptist or the Evangelical
46:45 -  total God calling total men all of the tribes of Israel
46:57 -  it has to do with the whole body of Christ and not just your Jewish campaign or this need or the drug addict
47:09 -  the foundations need to be restored twelve stones pertaining to all of Israel
47:23 -  foundational stones that pertain to true church what are these stones?
47:33 -  those that believed were together neither said any man that the thing which he had was his own they were steadfast in the apostles doctrine
47:45 -  and in the breaking of bread and in prayer not ceremonial prayer
47:57 -  or prayer request who had a silent request this morning? I see that prayer
48:09 -  that's not apostolic prayer steadfast in prayer true prayer
48:17 -  agonizing prayer out of the depths of the people together
48:29 -  we have learned after four years of community experience the quality of our comfort prayer together the quality of our prayer that we have together
48:39 -  will not exceed the quality of our life together true prayer is not a performance the quality of it
48:51 -  the ability to touch heaven the depth and the reality of it the pulsating power of it
49:03 -  is itself a reflection of the quality of the life to which we have come together they went from house to house daily breaking bread
49:21 -  no Sunday business for them they were people of God a burning people
49:31 -  another kind of society another kind of kingdom only separated from the world
49:39 -  not drawn off by its merchandise and by its entertainment living in little private households its garages filled with cars
49:53 -  and each member of the family going his own way because they have the enablement highly individualistic
50:05 -  each man living for his own pleasure and delight coming together on a Sunday for an hour big sports
50:19 -  a lot of sports where God gives one or two hours and a few dollars in the collection
50:31 -  where idolatrous lives are led full of rebellion and self-will that has never asked God
50:41 -  what would you have for me to do and they call that the church hoping that some hot shot evangelists will come
50:55 -  to bring them a revival to make the services more exciting how sad
51:05 -  how tragic because it does not show forth the glory of God to the world it is not a kingdom
51:17 -  it is only an anemic culture and there is an hour of crisis coming an ultimate confrontation
51:29 -  shall leap and dance and scream upon their altars their altars the altars of mere indifference
51:43 -  of casualness things as usual matter of factness
51:51 -  a mere portion of their time and energy and substance they can be as frantic as they want on that altar they can multiply
52:07 -  their programs and their amplifiers but no fire of God shall ever fall there neither shall be a God that shall hear
52:19 -  because the God that I know the God who is a consuming fire the total God who calls the total man totally
52:31 -  cannot stand that which is lukewarm that which is merely casual and matter of fact he looks for lovers
52:43 -  who are passionate totally given to him and when he finds it
52:53 -  his fire falls upon their lives upon their ministry
52:59 -  upon their relationships upon their relationships upon those that are about them
53:05 -  that they can save to a dying world by the fire of God and not as mere phraseology
53:17 -  for the kingdom of heaven is at hand see how much easier it is just to go out and witness
53:31 -  to do this for God or that when we're actually doing it for ourselves our own subtle ambitions are interwoven with it
53:45 -  our own gratifications to alleviate our own guilt of some compelling necessity to do
53:55 -  of some compelling necessity to do on which God's fire cannot fall and that's why he said wake
54:15 -  wake in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high until the fire of my spirit shall fill you
54:27 -  not that you should do witnessing for me but you shall be a glorious society
54:39 -  of total men given totally to God living totally together it's more than a Sunday cult
54:51 -  it's a kingdom come I've said so much this morning I don't know how you can contain it
55:13 -  I'll give one illustration and then we'll try and stop I came close to losing my life a month or so ago lying in a private plane
55:29 -  to reach the church of my first Pentecostal pastor my first Pentecostal pastor some brother volunteered to fly me in his private plane
55:53 -  we went through some very bad weather and the plane was icing up but we got there I had about five different invitations for that
56:13 -  almost all were close to where I was the strongest impression in my spirit was to go the farthest distance
56:27 -  at the greatest inconvenience for one service at this pastor's Pentecostal church such questions are not to be decided by convenience
56:43 -  the word should not even be in our vocabulary so I got there finally found myself on the platform
56:53 -  the meeting had already begun I don't have to describe it to you you've seen enough such meetings this far
57:03 -  it was predictable men trying to pump something up songs that were repeated
57:15 -  the nice and familiar expressions it's a culture to which you can become quite fond it's better than pornography
57:29 -  but there's no glory in it and I had no message until I was finally called upon to speak
57:39 -  and then I leaned on the pulpit in my usual weary way and groaned before God and out came some kind of picture
57:53 -  a vision of true church I could tell they were hearing this for the first time in all their religious life
58:09 -  they were receiving a picture a concept of church as they had never understood they had allowed the world to define the word
58:19 -  so not God now he was giving them his definition and I could see that they were startled
58:33 -  and some were deeply engaged leaning forward on the edge of their seats like hearing something for the first time
58:43 -  that was coming from heaven and then I sat down I'd finished, I'd spoken
58:51 -  the burden of the Lord and then the minister, the pastor came up well suited and
59:01 -  vest and the whole thing not that there's anything wrong in that I'm only speaking of it as a symbol
59:13 -  in keeping with the manner in which he was now going to speak I was astonished when I heard it I felt like a knife had been plunged into my heart
59:29 -  there was actually a pain in my heart and I think it was God's grief Art, what did this minister say?
59:37 -  I'm not good at mimicking and imitating something like this well I know that there are needs in the church tonight
59:51 -  have you come with some need? don't leave tonight there are needs in the church tonight
59:57 -  have you come with some need? don't leave tonight if your need has not been met
01:00:07 -  I would like you to come up now I invite you to come up your need
01:00:13 -  your need your need your need
01:00:21 -  it was the spirit of egocentrism it was the spirit of
01:00:27 -  egocentrism appealing to the self interest of men as if God himself had not spoken
01:00:39 -  about his need that to God be glory in the church
01:00:47 -  I was stunned I stayed over that night in his house it only cost eighty thousand dollars
01:00:59 -  but it's a bargain in this inflationary age the church itself had built it for him
01:01:07 -  and it was much more lavish than what he needed but it's an investment the market is going up
01:01:17 -  and it's foolish not to there were five cars four or five cars in the garage and in the driveway
01:01:29 -  the youngest son had a late model sport car the next morning I had to go get the pilot
01:01:37 -  and his wife who was staying overnight at his daughter's house she's only been married about a year or so
01:01:43 -  but they had a house more impressive even than her father's and as I got there the garage door was open
01:01:53 -  and a big boat was being taken out of the garage with an enormous outboard motor do I have to say anything more?
01:02:03 -  it all goes together it's a dream do I have to say anything more?
01:02:11 -  it all goes together what's wrong with a lifestyle like that if you can afford it? everything is wrong with it
01:02:23 -  the world is living beyond its means as the spirit world tries to get men to become absorbed with merchandising
01:02:33 -  with things and some are struggling to live within their means but you know what I had to say to our own community?
01:02:49 -  we need to live beneath our means in a lifestyle that is in keeping with the apostolic desires of God
01:03:03 -  as men who are separated from themselves and are not living for convenience or for ease but as lives that are totally given to God
01:03:19 -  that unto him there might be glory in the church there's an altar that needs again to be rebuilt in our generation
01:03:33 -  and where is that prophetic people who will do it? who have the authority of God to call all Israel to a showdown and confrontation
01:03:49 -  and who are not afraid of the King Ahab or the Jezebels of their age and who burn for the vision of God's glory and whose hearts are broken
01:04:03 -  because they see an entire Christianity become a culture and that they can cry out to that world how long will you hold between two opinions?
01:04:15 -  if God be God, follow him serve him totally
01:04:23 -  he's not interested in anything less and who will restore the altar that has fallen down and lay apostasy
01:04:35 -  and lay apostolic foundations and not just be interested in renewing Caiaphas and cooperating with the existing
01:04:45 -  establishment and becoming ourselves performers who are paid for services rendered
01:05:01 -  that God's fire can fall again on a true sacrifice that is total
01:05:13 -  and is wedded by the tears of the saints it will not fall on dry sacrifice but only that that has been saturated
01:05:23 -  with the tears of the saints for their own pitiful condition which is filled with selfishness
01:05:35 -  often disguised in the phraseologies of God but still full of self-seeking still egocentric
01:05:51 -  and for the condition of the church itself when God will have these conditions when God will have these conditions
01:06:01 -  when God will have these conditions then will the fire of God fall the church without fire
01:06:13 -  is not the church revival is not just a spasmatic momentary phenomenon it is the required norm of God
01:06:33 -  a church or a Christian who is not living in continual revival is falling short of the glory of God
01:06:47 -  there needs to be repentance that when the world shall see this glory that when the world shall see this glory
01:06:59 -  they will cry out again the Lord is God nothing else will suffice
01:07:11 -  nothing less but fire from heaven on a true altar
01:07:17 -  of true sacrifice total sacrifice wedded with tears
01:07:25 -  and this is the burden of the Lord shall we pray? don't be ashamed to ask for yourself
01:07:39 -  and to acknowledge that you have not even tears that the statement of your pitiful condition is that you are dry-eyed
01:07:51 -  and even incapable of repentance ask God for the grace and the goodness
01:08:01 -  that will enable you to repent even for your own condition with which you were satisfied
01:08:09 -  and thought that you were heads and shoulders above most you even come to a school of disciples you even come to a school of disciples
01:08:19 -  and thought this was the norm and had no vision for his glory it was all steeped in your own self-interest
01:08:31 -  and that needs to be burned down ask God for tears ask him for fire
01:08:41 -  repentance has got to begin with the church the priests and the ministers first the Lord whose burden I spoke this morning
01:08:55 -  is also waiting to hear our prayer let it begin now
