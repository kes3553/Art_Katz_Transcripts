Widows and Slaves Indeed

00:00 -  And it's unspeakable privilege to be a slave of Christ So Doing the will of God from the heart
00:12 -  With goodwill doing service as to the Lord and not to men Knowing that whatever whatsoever good things any man doeth the same will he receive of the Lord whether he be bond or free Whether you're the master or the slave
00:26 -  If you do it if you're a master as unto the Lord, you're going to be treating your bond slaves differently Not because you're required by social legislation but because you're in a relationship with one who is a master over you and
00:40 -  You want to extend to those who are under you the same kind of grace that has come from above to you See how God has an answer Christ is the answer
00:51 -  But not in some kind of Formulaic way it's a mode of being if people could see it. We don't need revolutions We don't need social upheavals because there's nothing the book of Proverbs says
01:03 -  there's nothing more terrible than for a servant to become a ruler and When we were in your Caterinburg, that's the city where the Tsar was was butchered He and his family were shot and killed and the order was given by a Jewish Bolshevik
01:21 -  That's going to come back on our heads. You can believe and if you see the pictures of this are talk about nobility The guy is something just to look at his picture I Would rather take my chances with rule by someone like that
01:39 -  Then some gutter snipe who has come up from the bottom full of grievance and resentment and is able to pull a trigger And he's now going to call the shots over me and over the nation For a servant to be to take on ruling a rulership by force
01:56 -  is Something not to be desired. We the way that the world is constituted That God made the world with Kings with the rulers and the ruled with
02:10 -  Masters and slaves is another way of understanding reality and That there's a greater issue at stake than men Tearing up in order to court obtain freedom and I'm looking at pearls
02:24 -  I'm saying that thinking as the former US history teacher about the American Civil War and What that has done to this nation? Beyond all of the foreign wars that we have ever fought more lives were lost in America
02:38 -  Between north and south over the issue of slavery than any any foreign war in which we've ever been engaged and And the fabric was torn in such a way that has not been repaired to this day And what has been the result even of the civil rights movement?
02:55 -  Though it was pacifistic. It did not Employ violence, but the language and the spirit and temper. What comes out of these things when you tear? And and the dawn breaks are men happier are their lives more real is there greater justice?
03:14 -  In what they have obtained and won through those means or if we had remained in the condition in which God has set us and believe that God himself in his sovereignty has established it and that there's something to be wrought and displayed there of a kind that
03:32 -  Glorify him and bring answer to men There will be peace there will be benefit. There will be benevolence There there will be the revelation of God and what are we seeing in Israel?
03:43 -  But something of the same thing through usurping through force through manipulation through intimidation through threat a Jacob people taking a land by the exertion of themselves
03:56 -  Rather than waiting to receive it as inheritance and as gift under the conditions that God intended that were covenantal We would have seen another Israel altogether. We would not be seeing blood being spilled in the in these Palestinian cities, we would not see these days of rage and outrage and
04:14 -  vehemence and bitterness that comes when men are Exacerbated by the demands of others upon themselves and like brings like hatred brings hatred violence brings retribution and more so so they they blow up a
04:30 -  Hamas leader with a helicopter with it with a missile and as the reprisal 1520 innocent Israelis are then killed in streets and in cities and in response to that another wave of violence It's a downward spiraling. It's death death death. This is the way of life. What is apostolic is life
04:50 -  Because God is the creator and life is respected and revered because of him and Though there are seeming injustices and things that need to be born Saints are tried by that they are perfected by that to be a God pleaser and not a man pleaser
05:07 -  Is not just some superficial upward accommodation It's the deepest expression of some inward work of God Because you cannot feign this if you're going to be a God pleaser, it's not merely superficially making an adjustment
05:22 -  It's got to come out of the deepest Inward working of God or else. It's phony It's no longer pleasing to God not to man
05:31 -  So the Lord Paul is saying what we should do, but he doesn't make spell out What this will require in your relationship with God? If you're going to be this kind of a servant to this kind of a master who should be doing better because he's also a Christian
05:47 -  But he's not doing it and you're not resentful and you're serving him even all the more Paul says all the more Show yourself Faithful that kind of conduct can only issue out of the deepest relationship with God himself
06:02 -  Which is as much available to a slave as it is to the master Is not enough over You your ability to perfect and develop a relationship with God
06:14 -  That would enable you not to be a man pleaser Is available as much to the man in chains as to the man with the whip? Then nothing externally has to be altered and yet within that framework
06:30 -  If we take the word of Paul seriously and seek its fulfillment would bring about the most radical transformation in society itself bloodlessly Knowing that whosoever what so ever good things any man does the same shall I receive of the Lord whether he be bound or free
06:48 -  The same shall he receive of the Lord when? When will he receive of the Lord not necessarily in this life His good service as a God pleaser and not a man pleaser is not necessarily going to bring an immediate benefit now
07:04 -  And if he's going to look for that in the change that is going to come from his master's boss He's going to be disappointed But the man who is a God pleaser does not look for immediate gratification
07:17 -  When will he receive of the Lord he'll receive of the Lord when the Lord comes and brings his reward with him and gives to? Every man according to his works. This is an appeal to those who have an s catalogical mindset of expectation that do not demand or need
07:35 -  Instant gratification and pay off now for they know that there's a payoff coming that when it comes it is eternal and Enduring and beyond description that I have not seen that you have not heard what God has laid up for those who love him And that motive and that belief can enable a man to plug away day after day in dreary monotony and regularity and
07:57 -  Injustice and not gripe and not complain and not murmur, but rejoice for he knows how much greater Reward that will be his he lives in anticipation of that reward Or else this is meaningless
08:10 -  This kind of counsel is like water off the duck's back. It is totally impractical. It can't be performed Unless it is set in its s catalogical framework of Expectation and of course what is an apostle but that very thing an apostle is one who has brought eternity into time
08:30 -  He sees he talks about this present world. Don't be don't be Conformed to this present world. What do you mean? Is there any other? Yeah, this present thing is passing This is momentary the one that's coming is the real one that's eternal and for which this is a time of preparation
08:48 -  And you can find that preparation for your eternal reward as much in as a slave as you can as a master In fact you you may find an eternity you have more privilege more honor more distinction More oversight over five cities and over ten than your master you were his slave in this earth
09:07 -  But because you bore that social station with Christian dignity and Patience and forbearance as coming from the hand of the Lord and serve the Lord in that place without resentment without disappointment in Anticipation that when that future comes your reward and its distinction honor will much exceed the men who rule over you
09:29 -  This is reality and unless we take this into consideration We ourselves are Hitting on three or four similar and we're just putting our way through life. We are perhaps more dead than
09:41 -  Than than alive These this whole thing needs to be factored in and made as real to us as Paul Paul is speaking from the vantage point of uttermost reality. He sees
09:55 -  Eternity he sees the reward that is to come and therefore he can counsel men who are in the most Unappreciated Despicable places of servitude and say don't bolt. Don't get violent. Don't do your master in but
10:11 -  Patiently take that as the place that God has assigned and in that place Show to this man even greater service all the more because she's a believer, but he's not acting like it and Your reward will be the greater in the Lord's coming
10:26 -  And You masters do the same thing in verse 9 for bearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven and There's no respect of persons with him
10:36 -  So there's a little side note to the men who are masters that they need also to reckon on who is their master Finally my brother to be strong the Lord and in the powerless might Don't let that pass without due appreciation finally my brethren
10:51 -  Paul is speaking both to slaves and to masters and they're both his brothers talk about freedom in Christ talk about
11:01 -  rising above class distinctions and race distinctions and all of the kinds of things that make men to feel inferior or Cut out or shut out shut out Paul says my brethren Doesn't matter what your social station is whether you're a master or slave is not your determination, but his
11:18 -  But here's the one thing that encloses us all you're my brethren This this is no phony Social liberal showing that he has a sympathy for the poor. This is deeper. This is my brethren
11:34 -  We're pulling here together For the for the Lord and his name and his honor So put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the walls of the devil
11:42 -  We don't wrestle against flesh and blood your master is not the enemy There are greater issues beyond
11:50 -  flesh and blood but the prince of powders and powers of darkness and So put on the breastplate of righteousness that your feet shard with the gospel in preparation of peace Taking the shield of faith where when you shall be able to quench all the fiery dots of the wicked even though you're a slave
12:05 -  You have full Opportunity to put on this armor. This is not just for your master because he has a greater social privilege No all of this provision to fight the fight of faith
12:17 -  Which is not with weapons that are carnal but spiritual is as much your privilege as his you can put on the breastplate of righteousness as a slave how by Conducting yourself without resentment and bitterness to the man who is overview. That is righteousness and
12:33 -  Then and save yourself from the fiery dots by the shield of faith That will quench all the fiery dots of the wicked And you know what those fiery dots are to a slave that you don't you fool you don't have to suffer this
12:46 -  This guy is just as a phony baloney believer He look at the pretense what has he ever done since he's come to the faith that has changed your situation one night Oh, where has he ever given you greater consideration?
12:58 -  Where's he giving you a day off an hour off that guy's a phony Paul's counsel is a bunch of baloney It's just to make you subjective and subjective and servile and keep the system going This he's a false apostle you have every right to throw off these shackles and you're a free man in Christ now
13:15 -  You don't have to take this guff Paul says take take up the shield of faith. That's the fiery dot That's that's the accusation of the enemy who knows exactly what to finger what to appeal to you
13:27 -  Don't have to submit yourself to that You're a free man yours from spiritualism. You're more spiritual Put up the shield of faith and don't let those dots get to you
13:38 -  stay with the council you got from God's own man and You have access To every defense and all of the shield of faith and the armor and the best way to rest as anyone
13:50 -  The fact that you're a slave does not prohibit you from taking on the full armor of God So From then Paul says pray for me for utterance that was given to me to open my mouth boldly to make known
14:08 -  The mystery of the gospel because what Paul is proclaiming is a revolution without blood What Paul is proclaiming is more than a little formula for how to get saved
14:19 -  Paul is touching the deepest issues of life and society That that is the genius of the gospel that has come down from heaven It's a mystery and it can save men from violence from death from misspent living from false causes
14:34 -  Who should know that better than we have the 20th century of what false causes have meant for mankind? I think there were 20 million kulaks that Stalin Annihilated a kulak was a middle-class peasant
14:47 -  He wanted to standardize the whole of Russian agriculture in a system and all of these individual Middle-class farmers who had histories of traditions Blood nothing but blood and what is Russian agriculture? My God, they're if they can get across the bread
15:05 -  They're grateful for a system that continually fails because systems must fail when the organic thing that has been wrought over the process of Trying through generations of skill devotion to the soil attention and love for animals is destroyed overnight by men with systems Paul's gospel is a revolution and that's why they pray for me. I'm not just preaching a little
15:28 -  cutesy thing here step one step two What my word is is the word from heaven on how men ought to live and for that I need utterance and pray for me For I am an ambassador in bonds
15:42 -  That therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak I could not address the situation Except that I myself were also in bonds if I was speaking from any other places I've said before of social privilege or I'm an apostle and I've got this coming and that
15:58 -  My words would fall limply to the floor, but because my social condition is worse Physically and naturally than those whom I am addressing my word to them has greater credibility and power For I have not a place to lay my head and I'm hated
16:13 -  I'm a despised and I'm beaten and I'm not left for dead and I have no certain future Known and unknown. I'm a man in bottoms. My life was not my own. I don't call my own shots I don't say where I'm going or what I'm going to do or even know what to speak
16:28 -  I'm I'm really a slave, but I'm rejoicing in it and my exhibition of the freedom in Christ that I Bear is itself a liberating message whether I speak it or not Just my coming as one in chains is an encouragement and an illumination
16:47 -  For those in physical change and in servitude that that's not the worst of all evils That even in that the grace of God can come and beyond that Great reward for your ability to bear it as I'm bearing it also
17:00 -  in this present world Well, let me try and close because this is so rich and I love it so much As this ex-Marxist, you know how Das Kapital begins, the classic work of Karl Marx
17:12 -  Which is the invitation to social revolution and bloodshed Workers of the world throw off your chains You have nothing to lose, but your chains. That's how Das Kapital begins
17:27 -  So we have two gospels the worlds the both coming from Jews Throw off your chains, you don't have to take this You can be free free for what free for a commissar free for some punk
17:41 -  Who's going to tell you now how to run the show and regulate your life in every detail That freedom is the worst slavery than what you were under and its end is violence and death God says keep your chains
17:55 -  Paul says I myself am also in chains Paul says I myself am also in chains But I kiss them and I thank God for them for in his great sovereignty. He has determined my call
18:09 -  I'm not an apostle by my own choosing and you're not a carpenter or a bookkeeper or working in the supermarket or Department store by Caprice or by accident you're in that place and in that call as much as I am in in mind And in that very place is as much
18:25 -  Portent and possibility for the showing forth of the grandeur of God and the wisdom of God the grace of God As any of place and that's why you're there You're not there to make a living. That's that's a secondary thing
18:37 -  You're there to represent me to be a witness unto me And I said to this teacher as we were driving in the car in the Ukraine whose kids were Insubordinate I said what you need to determine whether teaching is a vocation or a calling
18:53 -  Whether you're a professional or a servant of God Have you ever faced that issue and ever decided that issue because once you were a servant you'll take the guff You'll bear up with those kids because more is at stake than your success and your professional honor
19:10 -  What's at stake is their souls and the end eternity and what you display before them in your patience Day by day for they'll have no other expression of God than what they see in you in that classroom where they're living in an atheistic country This one last there you can make a note of first Peter 221 and
19:37 -  Colossians 322 where Paul speaks on the same subject with other insight But foot without time for tonight today just 1st Corinthians 7 One little note that needs to be added
19:54 -  Not how cold being a slave What a question Well, I'm not cold. I'm not a preacher
20:05 -  I'm at the bottom of the social pile. I don't I don't even have an identity My life is not my own. I can't even marry I Can't leave this property
20:15 -  Poses. Are you cold? Being a slave. It's a very same question. I put to this teacher Are you a vote? Are you a professional who has a vocation or are you called?
20:25 -  Into a mission field that is called the schools the high schools You need to know that you have to ask that question And of course many called to chosen you may despise you're calling you may not recognize it as a calling and you're living
20:42 -  Therefore only as a flunky only as a vocation only as a job. Well, no wonder it's dreary Because you're not seeing it in the magnitude of what it in fact is as God sees it. You're not seeing it apostolic Lee You're seeing it humanly
20:56 -  Are thou called being a servant don't you care not for it don't don't give a rap But that thou mayest be made free use it rather For he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord's freemen
21:10 -  Likewise also he that is called being free as Christ's servant. You are brought with a price But not be not the servants of men Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with God
21:24 -  You know, I probably should not have Included this this deserves another Sunday all by itself Because you know what Paul is saying here
21:36 -  This thing in which you're called is not only an opportunity to make me known and to obtain an eternal reward But in that very situation is transformation itself for you Is transformation itself for you
21:53 -  You can be transformed right in that situation By merely a change of mind and a change of attitude If you recognize that it's a call
22:03 -  And submit to it as i'm submitting to my call Paul says that you might be made free Use it don't don't see yourself as a victim and moan and groan about I never had a break I never had advantages of education use it
22:18 -  Take that situation and be transformed by that very same thing in the attitude that you bring to it, which is heavenly It'll free you you're going to come out another person. You're going to come out larger than life This this is where apostles are formed in the narrow place of constriction
22:36 -  Where where we're chafed to wish we had greater opportunity. No Submit there for the place of restriction is the place of enlargement. You'll be transformed by it That's why I saw these these men before the wall came down
22:49 -  Simon, I don't know if you know it was earlier than your time In in leipzig, I met that man again on this trip. He was he was a a children's ministry youth worker He wasn't even ordained lutheran
23:02 -  But he was working within the lutheran system the same kind of thing that I had to choke and sputter against in st Paul and the two lutheran
23:12 -  Attendants were under communist authorities who were not even saved. It's a moot question where the lutheran bishops were But this man never bucked. He never sought to circumvent it He could not go out and start his own church the way we were doing america. We don't like the condition to make our own
23:28 -  No He had to serve God in that strangulating restriction And because he submitted to it as coming from God he he became free by it
23:39 -  He came he himself was transformed in that confinement and came to a place of apostolic stature the man had has Such a depth such a breadth of being
23:52 -  Such a Godliness such a righteousness. It was made in the place of contraction Paul says use your situation You're not victim to anything if you recognize that i'm the author of it and you receive it as your call
24:07 -  Whether you're a freeman or a slave it doesn't matter Remain in that calling and in it is the prospect for transformation that you might be made free For to be free in christ is to be free
24:23 -  indeed So just a little glimpse at the apostolic mindset Knowing
24:35 -  That Paul averted a disaster for the church In keeping people who are in bondage from throwing off their chains as carl marx said you have nothing to lose But your chains. Oh, yeah, you have everything to lose when you throw off
24:49 -  But submit to the place where in you are called and in that use it rather To be transformed and to find the freedom with or without chains that cannot be bought for money Thank you
25:01 -  And it avert social Catastrophes and bloodshed and violence and the tearing of families in the civil war there were families on both sides suffering at each other's hands death over
25:14 -  rectifying social issues That God himself Had established and would have wrought another america
25:21 -  We would be another nation today if we had allowed God to work out the issue of slavery and freedom And and the greatest fictional character in all american literature
25:34 -  Strange to say the one phrase that no black person wants to be accused of is uncle tom When I read uncle tom in american literature at the university level I was astonished. I was this this figure uncle tom who bore stripes
25:50 -  And and suffered indignation brutality because of his christlikeness never once sought to be free of his master and could have He was mighty in his personal strength could have broken loose submitted and unto death
26:04 -  What you have in uncle tom's cabin is the picture of christ in a black man who is a slave? So there's probably greater potential for america In a black people who will submit to their conditions rather than be violently seeking to free themselves from it
26:22 -  And and that's true for any of us What seems the most discouraging the american indian wherever people are oppressed on the minority conditions and have to face a servitude of unjust conditions there
26:38 -  The potential for the kingdom of God is the greatest in what can be displayed to those who receive it as their calling Coming from God and find the solution of God by his spirit in that place and are themselves transformed as well as transforming others This is the gospel
26:56 -  So lord, we bless you. Oh lord For Paul my God What a piece of humanity what an example. Thank you. My God. You didn't give us a textbook with principles
27:09 -  You gave us a flesh and blood man faced with comfort Conditions appropriate both to his age and to every age those issues have not changed They're the same in our own generation and has brought my God rivers of blood by those who have sought to
27:25 -  Uh send off their chains So we thank you for what Paul is for his mind for his way of seeing real widows as against for false How how to understand our situation how to act within it not as man pleases but as God pleases
27:43 -  That requires God and there's a God who can be required of For he will give grace to those who submit to his word and to his way And so we're blessed lord, oh my God, no wonder that they're clamoring now
27:56 -  Don't give us anything else out but apostolic prophetic foundations for that includes the subject of Israel And lord willing lord by your grace We will give it and we'll give it as one in chains not coming to them from some superior
28:11 -  holiday in mode of life But out of the circumstances where you have called us
28:18 -  So we bless you lord Oh, may you free the church that the church could be a statement of that ultimate freedom to a world that is in bonds Even while it thinks it's so free and who are dead even while they live
28:31 -  Show them what life is show them what freedom is my God that has been purchased by your blood the sacrifice of yourself At the cross you you've sent freedom my God into mankind And so we bless you and bless every child in this room my God to review and look at their present circumstance
28:49 -  What their employment is what the condition of their life? And to be freed from murmuring and complaint and to receive it as from the hand of God and there to show his grace So we bless them everyone my God. Oh, thank you for Paul
29:04 -  The man in himself the flesh and blood thing my God Speaking just off the cuff about the issues that need to be touched In a small things but in that small thing what a window
29:18 -  Of the of the greatness of God of the genius of the faith of the so great salvation We're blessed lord and we want to be like that. We want that reality. We want that perception Taken up with this word that
29:34 -  Was spoken to these ministers as a day of small beginnings, you know the way the lord will begin They come to a situation without any plan for it And then something is quickened in the early morning hours and you begin with what the lord has given
29:49 -  And if these men had been patient And had waited and trusted the lord from this modest beginning because the subject was widows Widows and slaves. I don't know how the lord had me the major on the minor key
30:04 -  But it began with that little subject in first timothy. You can turn to it chapter five And probably Had they understood the process of God
30:18 -  Who is pleased to begin with small things they might have ended up with a really Large statement from the lord that would have helped them all their days The reason that I was boycotted after that is that there was this kind of a word for them was a disappointment
30:33 -  They were hoping something from america that had to do with church growth some program some special principles or methods
30:42 -  that would bring Numbers and here's this guy coming with some minor note on widows
30:50 -  So you can imagine their disappointment but i'm speaking this
30:57 -  It's been requested that And simon and others heard about this they said well, let's let us hear it bring it on sunday So
31:08 -  Something that has come out of all of these weeks that will now touch the future is a growing Awareness on the part of many for apostolic and prophetic foundations All of the commitments that have been made for october in holland and in germany that have come out of this present trip
31:28 -  I'll specify that this should be the topic of the leadership seminars and other activity This there just seems to be an awareness growing awareness that these foundations need to be developed And so the lord has given us a very precious perspective
31:45 -  on that word apostolicity That goes way back into ben Israel's history and continues increasingly to become a central focus And the remarkable thing about Paul on widows and slaves
32:00 -  Is that it's almost a minor note in passing just Paul tending to some practical
32:07 -  matters in In giving timothy guidance for his own conduct with the church But as so often is the case
32:17 -  sometimes the profoundest Insights and observations of the nature of something are given not in the grandiose climactic statements but in some little thing in passing some minor note some observation of something that seems relatively
32:32 -  Trivial in comparison to the greater the weightier objects of concern and you can see in the microcosm Of a small note being struck the real genius of what is apostolic and that's why I love this so much So in chapter 5 of first timothy
32:50 -  Paul is instructing on the subject of widows and He says in verse 3 on the widows who are really widows
33:00 -  Now right there we ought to be arrested. What do you mean widows who are really widows? Isn't a widow by definition one who has lost her husband through death Evidently Paul does not make his determination or his definition
33:14 -  On natural factors And that's and in that we begin to see what the apostolic mind is that goes beyond The immediate the physical and the apparent
33:26 -  That the issue of widowhood is something more than the absence of a husband that there are widows and widows A real what is a real widow because if there's such a thing as a real widow then what shall we say about real believers? Real pastors real evangelists real teachers
33:44 -  Real husbands real wives if Paul can make a distinction about widows as real and unreal That distinction then can be extended to almost every category and that's exactly the point there is an apostolic perception of everything that is above and beyond what what one understands and it's into that realm that God wants to draw us
34:05 -  To that realm that God wants to draw us and sometimes it's just a hairline of difference, but that hairline Speaks volumes So honor widows who are really widows
34:17 -  If a widow has children i'm in verse four of chapter five of first timothy If a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn the religious Their own family make some repayment to their parents, but this is pleasing in God's sight
34:30 -  The real widow left his Paul's definition The real widow left alone Has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day
34:43 -  But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives Oh you dear saints tune in Adjust your focus
34:52 -  And don't miss a nuance of what Paul is saying in this one passing pithy statement Because he's expressing his apostolic heart and mindset and mentality all the more profound Because he has no awareness that this is going to pass into scripture. This is just
35:11 -  Uh a momentary piece of counsel to a man Called timothy who's going to be working with the church But in it is such a insight of the depth of Paul's mind
35:23 -  That is that defines the word apostolic. Let's go over this The real widow who's the real widow Left alone like like the ordinary widow, but what makes her real she has set her hope in God
35:38 -  This is apostolic. In other words every definition Of what is real has got to be set in the context of God If that dimension is missing, it's no longer reality
35:50 -  It's just physical. It's just natural. It's just social. It's just political But when God is a factor that establishes its authenticity and its reality a real widow Is one who takes God into the consideration is what Paul is saying
36:07 -  And if that's if that's what makes a widow real Then it must be the same thing that makes a believer real a teacher real an apostle real a prophet real Reality is the issue of God
36:18 -  And here's a woman left alone, but how does she? Occupy herself In the absence of a husband she has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day
36:31 -  But the widow who lives for pleasure This would have to be interpreted This is the antithesis of living for God is living for pleasure
36:42 -  That one is dead even while she lives So here we have not only a definition of little hood. We have a definite definition of life Life is not biological activity
36:54 -  life is relationship to God in significant prayer supplication and service If that factor is absent and removed that the person is dead even while they live whether they're widows husbands sons
37:08 -  Anything and this is exactly what I saw in east germany in the city of magdeburg as I shared with other the saints here on wednesday night When they had a saturday morning outreach at the public mall I watched the people come out with their shopping carts from these supermarkets in the different stores
37:25 -  And they were like corpses. They were walking corpses. They had biological activity, but that's all they had They were dead literally dead. There was no light. There was darkness or
37:37 -  grim But they think That biological activity and motion and movement and being able to buy and go into stores and fill shopping carts is living
37:49 -  But I saw right through that and I let them know what I saw I told them that their faces accused them that they're that What's the word?
38:01 -  Their the indictment Of God is written in their faces That they're dead even while they live and I didn't even remember that this verse was in here
38:11 -  But the statement was in their bodily life We need to see like that. That's how Paul saw And therefore we should not be impressed with physical motion with movement with bodies with cities with its death
38:25 -  And maybe the whole contest of what reality is and the whole invincible thing from beginning is a contest between death and life and death seems to be running the show
38:37 -  And people think that that their that their life is life when it's really death But we who are in relationship with God and supplications and in prayer and service Have the spirit of life know indeed what life is and we need to bring
38:52 -  The challenge of life to the dead and not be impressed with their death as if that represents life You see this is fanatical It's almost maniacal
39:03 -  The russian authorities would have every right to take a man like this and put him behind bars Or send it to a mental mental institution and shoot him up with drugs or give him shock treatments
39:15 -  Because his his view of reality Is totally askew It's not at all in keeping with what the world defines and recognizes as reality
39:25 -  And yet the issue for us and the issue for the church is Is Paul seeing? definitive
39:31 -  Is the way that Paul sees Is that true seeing and what is an apostle or a prophet these foundational men? But men who see as God sees and what is a church built on that foundation?
39:43 -  A church also that sees as they see and that this is reality though everything conspires against it If you're going to take a view like this, you're going to make yourself a candidate to be opposed Because this isn't some trifle. This is the very grit of what is real. What is life about? What is life?
40:03 -  See where Paul is getting at So this insanity is apostolicity This is definitive seeing
40:12 -  And out of this seeing comes all of Paul's conduct all of Paul's activity all of Paul's service all of Paul's sacrifice This is not just an observation that he can enjoy with a cup of coffee This is the the foundation of of the wellspring of all that he does
40:29 -  This is how he sees and because he sees like that. He speaks like this. He writes like this. He acts like this That's an apostle And we need to appreciate it
40:42 -  But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives So give these commands as well so that it may be above reproach and whether it does not provide for relatives Especially for family members has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever an infidel. Here's another
40:57 -  uh The definition another absolute statement of a maniacal kind
41:04 -  Where Paul says in effect, I don't care what they profess to believe or how faithful they are to Be in agreement with certain doctrines or even have had a born again experience If they do not act in a certain way if that faith does not translate into conduct of a very particular kind
41:23 -  Toward their own they they're it's a it's a non-faith. They are as they are like infidels. They are as good as unbelievers You know, does it talk about radical? I don't know extreme and yet this is not the dyspeptic
41:41 -  Thoughts of a man who's out of sorts and has certain strange negative views these are the definitive apostolic statements of the man Paul Who is the chief apostle and we need to give very special attention to every one of his asides
41:59 -  Every one of his comments All the more powerful because he never thought or intended that they should be considered as programmatic As a way of defining faith. They're just observations that Paul is sharing with timothy
42:11 -  But in them we have the very ground of apostolic being all the more powerful because it's it's uh Off the cuff it's natural Not programmed natural natural it's it's just a man
42:28 -  Pinched him on the question of widows and the question of taking care of widows that are real widows And and you have an obligation don't give us this highfalutin spiritual stuff and neglect your own flesh and blood You're as good as an infidel your faith
42:42 -  Does not count for anything It's a denial of the faith it's worse than being an unbeliever. Why is it worse? Because it purports to be faith
42:52 -  You'd be better off in that kind of conduct to be an unsaved person Then you can still be reached and converted But having purported to be saved and and conduct yourself in this way makes it even worse
43:08 -  So let a widow Be put on the list if she's not less than 60 years old and has been married only once She must be well attested for her good works as one who is born of children shown hospitality
43:18 -  Wash the saint's feet help the afflicted the lord of the self to being good in every way Well, I'll tell you what we can use an army of widows like that They're rare
43:30 -  But refuse to put younger widows on the list evidently The church had a list Of widows that were put under the church's care. Maybe they didn't have relatives who could watch over them
43:42 -  So here's another wonderful insight the church's care for its own And uh to have a list to be methodical to make sure that no one is missed is not unspiritual and um
43:55 -  Paul is is describing who's to be included And gives that wonderful description of showing hospitality washing the saint's feet
44:04 -  helping the afflicted And devoting herself to being good in every way but refuse to put younger widows on the list For when their sensual desires alienate them from christ they want to marry and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge
44:18 -  evidently These widows had at their widowhood made a public Declaration of determination that they're not going to seek to be married again
44:28 -  That they're now freed so to speak and to give their lives fully To the purposes of God and washing the feet of the saints and being devoted to their needs But evidently within a short period of time
44:39 -  Sensual need or interest has made them to contradict their first proclamation And uh Paul says they're not to be included before they have violated their first pledge Besides that they learn to be idle and getting about from house to house. They're
44:57 -  They're not merely idle but also gossips and busybodies Saying those things that they should not say and so on And
45:08 -  For some have already turned to satan to follow satan verse 15 If any believing woman has relatives who are really widows here again really Let her assist them
45:18 -  Let the church not be burdened so they can assist those who are real widows Insights So this is more than Paul's exaggerated statements they are definitive insights
45:40 -  Of what believing actually means This is not exaggeration for its own sake but the real
45:48 -  Revealing of the apostolic mind that sees beyond and through mere appearances to the reality That needs to be recognized
45:58 -  Of what is real Which is really a statement of how God himself sees it Apostolic seeing is God-seeing and then Paul turns to the subject of slaves
46:15 -  In chapter six Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor So that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed
46:28 -  Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them On the ground that they are the members of the church rather they must serve them all the more Since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved
46:41 -  Well, you can't really fathom how great an issue Paul is touching When the protestant reformation came The peasants of germany took occasion
46:55 -  to revolt against their masters and interpreted The reformation as an invitation or an incentive to be in violent
47:07 -  revolution against Their masters they were serfs peasants and they were landowners If you knew that know the history of revolution
47:19 -  And the blood baths and the devastation that follows any attempt by man to rectify Social institutions through violence you would understand that what Paul is touching here is not just the issue of society
47:35 -  but the church itself If the church was not guided over this question It would almost be inevitable
47:43 -  That believers would interpret the freedom in christ as to be free from their masters and to come out from this social institution
47:52 -  That has long precedence, but that maybe they that the gospel means To be free and to be in a new relationship by which they no longer need to heed Their masters and that could have set in motion not only
48:07 -  Reverberations throughout society but probably could have undermined the church itself And made the church into some kind of revolutionary radical social upheaving Upheaval by which the faith itself would have become sublimated and it would have just become a cause for social action
48:24 -  That's not an exaggeration because that's in fact what has happened to the liberal social gospel of the 20th century So this is a an issue that is remarkably charged With with enormous concern
48:38 -  So what Paul has to say here is not just touching the issue of The relationship between slaves and their masters
48:46 -  But the whole issue of the church itself is at stake in the kind of wisdom and counsel that he gives I'm going to go back and forth between my king james and the edition that i'm been using so far And read from other statements of Paul on the issue of
49:13 -  Bond and free because it's a remarkably significant Thing and an issue that could have destroyed the church So in the
49:31 -  ephesians chapter six or other statements of Paul on the same subject That fill out something of the ramification Of servants and
49:43 -  Masters you understand the predicament Both are now saved And shouldn't the servant
49:51 -  Who is now saved demand and expect from his master a new kind of relationship and consideration? And maybe to take it easier on him if he'll not release him from bondage to at least take it easier and in other ways show that Well, i'm a believer now and therefore you ought to receive certain
50:12 -  Consideration that was not to be expected before I came into the faith But Paul is saying what happens if your master does not give you those considerations even though he's saved Are you at liberty then to become resentful and bitter toward him all the more because you could call him a hypocrite
50:28 -  And what kind of believer are you and is that the kind of faith you have that has not in any way altered my relationship With you i'm still expected to work those many hours and without the compensation that would be fair This is no small question
50:44 -  And it's in these social issues that Paul is required to give comment that we see so much of the wisdom Of the mind of christ that is operating through Paul. That would be of great value even today Not that we're in the serve issue of being
51:00 -  Slaves to masters, but we're in the issue of being employees to employers And there's a certain application that is as valid in that as was valid To bond slaves with their masters. That is the issue of the faith itself
51:17 -  So in ephesians in chapter 6 Paul says servants in verse 5 be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh
51:26 -  With fear and trembling in singleness of heart as unto christ Don't look at your master as just being a piece of flesh and blood You're not laboring for him
51:38 -  You're really serving the lord and more than that the fact that you are a bond slave and that he's the master Is not some precarious accident of fate It's God's predetermined and sovereign wisdom that you should occupy that role while he occupies that role
51:54 -  And in that fixed relationship that God has ordained in his sovereignty Something is to be worked and something is to be revealed of the transcendent nature of the faith that will glorify God So don't you murmur?
52:08 -  Don't you complain? Don't you take upon yourself the mentality of a victim as if you have something coming because your master is not your master Your master is christ
52:18 -  And you know what authenticates this that Paul can speak with authority. He himself is a bond slave He's not speaking from some lofty ethereal height of a man coming out of his Holiday in suite and giving the church a few words of wisdom going back
52:32 -  to the privilege of that Lifestyle he himself is in chains Not literal, although at the end of his life they were literal but his entire believing life
52:43 -  He saw himself and he saw himself rightly as a bond slave of christ Therefore when he spoke to men who socially were bond slaves he could speak to them with an authority that was more than just Incidental. In fact, it was the very issue of making his counsel
53:00 -  Significant that he himself also was in a state just like unto them Only his master was the lord but he was no more free to do his thing than they are free to do their thing Because they ought to regard
53:15 -  Their physical masters in the same way that Paul regarded his namely as christ And to render service to them not as man pleasing or eye pleasing but as God pleasing I don't know if you guys realize this. This is a revolution
53:31 -  Hey, this is former marxist talking. I know what's radical and I would say in all of my Associations with the so-called radicalisms of the past that's kid stuff That's ephemeral stuff that
53:44 -  Goes into the dung heap it amounts to nothing but bloodshed This is radical. This is revolutionary and it doesn't require one iota of social change All that it requires is a change of mind
53:57 -  All it requires is an attitude All it requires is an apostolic mindset Nothing needs to be disturbed in the fabric of society itself because you don't want to begin tearing there
54:09 -  But in the given situation let that man Paul says in first quentin's remain in the place within he is called Because in that place is the whole drama and significance of the faith itself Don't look for some lustrous occasion. If only you could be freed from this narrow
54:30 -  With obligation that is monotonous and predictable and could be out there where art is Out in russia that that that that that that then you could really serve the lord But here in the monotonous regularity of my regular job from eight to five. I don't have the opportunity baloney
54:47 -  That is as profound an occasion for the setting forth of the grace of God and the marvel of the faith And the reality of God as anything that any man can do anywhere Who is it that has sent art to russia is no other than the one who has put you in that place of employment
55:02 -  It's the lord He's absolutely sovereign He's no he knows what he's doing and if you're faithful in that place with that employer under those circumstances in that monotony that regularity
55:14 -  That unfairness to serve the lord not as a man pleaser but as doing something as unto the lord And be faithful. He'll promote you. He'll he'll open Other doors, that's the place and you need to regard it as coming from the lord
55:29 -  And to serve the lord and not man with singleness of heart as unto christ not with eye service As men pleases but as the servants of christ doing the will of God from the heart You know, we we are a remarkable society
55:43 -  of slaves And yet every wit free We can kiss our chains
55:49 -  We're not begrudging That that we're under the obligation of christ Because to be chained in christ is paradoxically ultimate freedom
56:01 -  Look at Paul at at act 16 when he was actually in a cell Bound hand and foot with his back hanging in strips in the most stinking place where men urinated and defecated They didn't have outdoor toilets
56:14 -  That's right where they were they may have had a bucket that spilled over and all of that filth and all of that congestion and all of that Place where gangrene and death is an inevitability at midnight the darkest hour Paul and prio Paul and silas Praised God and sang prayed and sang praises on
56:32 -  I mean that's talk about madness talk about this this guy is not fit to live No wonder men threw dirt on their heads and made a vow this man's not fit to live If what he represents is reality and truth then what we are about is totally foamy
56:47 -  Absolutely fortunate but look at the this guy is rejoicing in his madness and is able to sing with his back hanging in stripes counting it all honor and privilege to have Born the sufferings of the lord in the obedience of the vision that came he's a bond slave
57:05 -  How else would he have left asia where the churches were being added to daily? To go to a place where he had no one had ever been before Philippi in europe in greece
57:16 -  Merely because he really he saw a vision that he was able to be checked from going further in asia where they were being prospered And go to a place to them before and what happens when you go there one woman gets saved Who was a demoniacal?
57:30 -  Character making her masses much gain and for that they were stripped beaten publicly in the in the marketplace and thrown into the dingiest of of cells To to language unto death there should have been every complaint
57:43 -  Is this what you call the heavenly vision? And uh, this is what I get from my obedience. I'm sitting here with my wounds unattended Shackled hand and foot i'm not even able to alter my position
57:56 -  Every man had a justification for complaint It's at that point Paul is rejoicing and giving praise unto God Because in that confinement is the freest man on the face of the earth
58:07 -  Because to be free in christ is to be free indeed. This is The ultimate paradox of the faith that we're slaves, but but our slavery makes us free We're free from the world
58:18 -  We're free from that the invisible taskmaster who kraskers whip that you have to have this car this house in this clothing this this this this You have what the lord gives In having food and clothing Paul says they're in be content. You're free from envy free from
58:34 -  From the kinds of things for which men exhaust themselves who are dead even while they live And this is real living because it serves the purposes of God it's moving toward a consummation It's in the mind and will of God who knows the end from the beginning
58:49 -  And it's unspeakable privilege to be a slave of christ So Doing the will of God from the heart
