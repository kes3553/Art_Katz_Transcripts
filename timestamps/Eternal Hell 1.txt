Eternal Hell 1

00:00 -  Oh precious God, even now Lord, even though we receive the honorary certificates of men, to you be all honor and praise and glory and acknowledgement. Thank you gracious God for this unspeakably rich presence. Thank you for these choice saints of God, Lord, that the love of you
00:20 -  is written in their faces and in their utterance and their manner and in their being. Thank you for this glorious fellowship that we have as believers in you. And Lord, we give this time to you. May you redeem every single moment of it, Lord. May you speak so deeply and richly to our
00:41 -  hearts and minds and lives that not a syllable shall fall to the ground and all that you intend by this hour shall be wholly transacted for your glory. In the name of Jesus we ask these things. Amen. The Lord has given me certain experiences as a Jewish believer which is not available to you
01:02 -  because you've grown up, I guess, is this part of the Bible belt or at least in a part of believing America that takes for granted the great doctrines of God and the questions of faith and even the name Jesus. All of these things are alien and removed from my life not only as a Jew but as
01:21 -  a modern man coming from a great urban center of New York City and it's just a wholly different style of life. The things which you've all along accepted and which to you would make such innately good sense and which have been confirmed daily in your experience were to men like myself,
01:39 -  the preposterous and foolish and not just harmless kinds of foolishness but even dangerous obstacles to human progress and so was I an enemy throughout all of my adult life from early manhood right until the my 35th year when God saved me not one who just looked with some mild
01:57 -  disdain and contempt upon religion and especially the Christian religion which I saw as the single greatest oppressor of the Jewish people and persecutor and who had been bent upon our forced conversion for centuries and would not let us alone and in fact which is still the mentality of
02:15 -  the Jewish people even as I speak and not merely merely willing to entertain your existence but looking upon you as dangerous obstacles to the progress of mankind because of your foolish beliefs and I'll tell you that what I felt then has become more compacted and more intense
02:33 -  and is growing like a great swelling thing underneath the surface of our life is going to break forth in great volume in our generation we are not merely going to be tolerated by the world we're going to be looked upon as a great very great offense and a dangerous obstacle
02:49 -  to what seemed to enlightened men to be progress and there shall come the hour and it should be far sooner than we think when men shall kill us and claim that they're doing God a service so I bring you a report from a frontier which you don't experience and because it pleased God to
03:07 -  make of me a mouthpiece and to bring me to places of exceptional confrontation with the spirit of the world especially as it is caught up and expressed by my own Jewish people in their in their unwitting place deep in the bosom of this world and its values and its rewards
03:25 -  we've had many fierce confrontations and I've seen men gnash teeth at me and be driven to great fury and anguish of soul because all that I represent in one fell swoop by the power of the spirit is a contradiction to which all they've given their lives and all to them that seems
03:42 -  eminently reasonable and right and sane and here I come with this foolish message preaching the gospel of that one who had not a place to lay his head and controverting all that seems to them to be wisdom if they accept the things which I speak and claim to be the truth of God it makes all
04:02 -  their life to have been a vain excursion to this moment can you understand what I'm saying and that's why men when they come to a confrontation with Jesus Christ even as I did myself 10 years ago were stunned and shaken to the very foundation and pit of their being I remember in the course of
04:21 -  my growing up years as a high school dropout frenzied Jewish kid trying to understand the bewildering universe as I traveled the length and breadth of this land looking for experience and understanding I was coming back to New York from California and I was hitchhiking
04:37 -  and I found out that if I when a car stopped and the man asked me if I could drive if I admitted that I could not I would not get a lift and so I quickly learned that I had to tell people that I knew how to drive though I did not and it was that year when the model changes were coming
04:53 -  out when they were putting the gear shift up on the wheels you know instead of the floorboard and so if a man had a wheel gear shift I said I only understood the floor gear shift and if he would shift for me I would appreciate it and if he had this the floor I told him I only understood
05:05 -  the wheel and so by the time I got to New York I knew how to drive you see there's something missing from the body of Christ and we Jews are not in our place in it and in my experience I was so green I remembered I was somewhere in the maybe even in this part
05:22 -  of the country trying to overtake a very slow moving car up on a hill and my judgment was so poor that I should not have done it and over the crest of the hill coming down on the opposite lane where I was was a car coming at a furious speed and it was a sheer collision and it seemed like
05:39 -  imminent death there was no way to avoid it and I just threw my foot on that brake with all the power that I had and gripped that wheel my knuckles were white and I could see the face of the man at the in the car approaching me in exactly the same condition and those two cars
05:55 -  convulsively shuttered as we both tried to reverse the enormous impetus and the direction in which we were traveling and we succeeded sufficiently for one moment in that violent shaking and trembling of cars trying to to reverse all of the power and the movement in which they
06:13 -  were caught up and just narrowly averted each other in averted death I'll never forget that experience because I see it time and time again both in my own confrontation with a Jesus whose name was a bone in my throat and as I represent him now even to my own kinsmen and to modern men
06:29 -  and to universities a great shattering and a shaking when we're confronted by that one and induced to change the whole course and sweep and direction of our lives it's the very meaning of repentance and I can't think of a more profound message for this high holiday season the days of
06:50 -  or young russia shana and yom kippur for jewish people right even as we sit this morning and that men should be stopped in their way and be turned to the living God but the lord even acknowledges that his gospel is a very foolish thing
07:05 -  Paul says for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God and I see it time and time again when I speak at universities that the moment I'm finished with my foolish presentation men get up
07:19 -  as for example at the university of California at one of the campuses and it happened to be a jewish man and an Israeli man and a professor of psychology and he told how enormously embarrassed he was by my presentation and had he known that I was going to try to induce men to return to the
07:34 -  middle ages he would never have come and that what I had to say was an offense to his sensibilities and to his intellect and then he went on further to denigrate my personality and the way I speak and everything was that was about me was all wrong and I in my concluding remarks that night
07:50 -  I told the students that I had been instructed that I was not allowed to pray publicly at that campus but for their convenience I would recite a prayer for salvation and I did so and then I concluded the meeting and when the meeting was over some kids came up to me and I the first one
08:05 -  I took one look at that face I knew it was jewish beautiful brown eyes and it was and the eyes were glowing with a certain kind of a light and I knew she had just been saved and there was a trembling and a tearfulness and had a voice was broken and I as she came to me I spoke to her
08:19 -  first I said something has just happened to you hasn't it she said yes mr cat she said even though you said that we couldn't pray that it was illegal she said when you prayed I prayed under my breath it's foolishness to them that perish but to us which are saved it is the power of God
08:40 -  for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
08:56 -  block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Gentiles Christ how many people know the meaning of that word Christ Christos what's the Hebrew equivalent Messiah Messiah there I was all those years stumbling over the sidewalks of Brooklyn
09:13 -  and I never heard an alien name more alien and more removed from my Jewish consciousness than the name Jesus Christ and not one person ever took the pain or the labor to explain to me why art that's only the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Yeshua HaMashiach the word Christ from the word
09:29 -  Christos is the Greek is the Hebrew word Messiah which means Messiah or that's a far more Hebrew word far more positive and far more warm and and redolent of Hebraic sound than the word Christos Christ the Messiah the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God
09:51 -  is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak
10:09 -  things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things which are not to bring to naught things which are that no flesh should glory in his presence and I want to tell you out of my own experience
10:26 -  that of all the foolishness of which God is and of all of the foolishness which God chooses that there's no point which more staggers modern men and more makes them to gnash their teeth and more makes them to be incredulous than the foolishness of that particular point of the gospel
10:45 -  than Jesus saying that I am the way the life and the truth and that no man cometh to the father but by me and I'll tell you people that upon my first reading of those words about aboard the deck of a tramp steamer 10 years ago a broken desolate modern man
11:05 -  a lifelong seeker after truth with a contempt for Christianity for the Bible for religion as as the as the religion of cop-outs too weak to live in this world unaided a book which I had long despised came into my hands the New Testament and as I described last
11:23 -  night in the first reading from the first line I was immediately impressed that this book was awesome and different from anything I'd ever previously read I staggered as I read on and began to recognize that this is ultimately a Jewish book and the characters are essentially
11:41 -  Jewish and none more Jewish than the great Jew of them all Yeshua but when he came to make these grandiose statements these unspeakably dogmatic statements something in me began to shake and to shudder like a car with the brake thrown on for the first time I was a relativist and I'll just
12:02 -  as a footnote as an and as an aside say that if we're not for us Jews this modern world would not be in its present form nor condition that the whole world although they may not be Jewish by birth are living in an essentially Jewish universe that the three greatest architects
12:19 -  of the modern world happen also to be Jewish Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein the impact of Marx we know and the impact of Freud we have some understanding but you think well Einstein you say art I understand that it's it's physics and the theory of relativity and
12:38 -  it has something to do with the advent of the atom bomb definitely but I'll tell you that the explosive content of the work of Albert Einstein in the thinking of most men is far more significant perhaps than even the advent of the atomic bomb the theory of relativity has percolated and found
12:57 -  its way even to the ordinary thinking and feeling and experiencing of men and women all over the face of this earth I didn't know a cotton-picking thing about science I don't know anything about physics but I was eminently a relativist and you know what that means all things are relative
13:18 -  who's to say what is truth who's to say what is right or what is wrong it's all relative maybe in one instance it is fornication but in another it's love it depends upon the circumstance it's relative who's to say that head hunting is murder in certain conditions among the primitive people
13:43 -  it's an aspect of their culture no man can say something is right or wrong or true or false I tell you that that is the most devastating thinking in the history of the human race and it's going to bring the modern world to its ultimate death and there's going to be unleashed
14:05 -  upon this earth such a soul sickness and such a wave of anarchy and chaos and a breaking down of every institution that men's hearts shall fail them for fear because no man can say what's right or what's wrong I was a relativist and I like to believe in my fancy as a modern man that there
14:29 -  were many paths to truth it was an offense to the sensibilities in which I was schooled for 35 years to insist that there's only a single path to truth and the reason for reason that I shrinked from turning to the bible although I was an omnivorous reader of the printed word
14:49 -  in all my quest for truth in all those years is that I resented so much as the implication that any one book could be the answer why every intellectual worth his salt knows that truth is to be gleaned from many sources and it's a search into which we give over our entire lives
15:08 -  and never have hope that we're going to come to the end of it to insist that there's a way a single way and that it's even a narrow way is an offense that God has planted deeply in the bosom of this world Jesus is an offense to the world for many reasons and I think none so great
15:31 -  in that he insists upon himself I am the way the truth in the life and no man cometh to the father but by me there's not a place in the time that I speak that men do not leap to their feet outraged that I dare insist upon that and they attack me as if I am preaching the gospel of Arthur Katz
15:52 -  and I'll tell you if you'll receive it I faced more vehement and bitter opposition at a Baptist liberal arts college than ever I experienced in any secular university on the face of this land there's a way that seemed with right unto a man but the end thereof is death and there's a great
16:14 -  filthy spirit being poured out on this earth by that seducer of souls that beguiles men and assures them that their wisdom is true and enhancing and honorable and and tolerant and liberal that such men will look upon those who insist upon a single narrow way as a deep offense
16:36 -  away with them and they cast Jesus over the brow of the hill and they stone Stephen to death and when when the Apostle saw all his great outrage against that heretical Jewish sect on his way to Damascus to extirpate them was struck and brought to his face in the dirt by a blinding light
16:57 -  that Ananias that simple believer whom God instructed to go lay hands upon him that he might receive his sight in the baptism of the Holy Spirit said go tell him what great things he must suffer for suffer for my name's sake that he might bear my light to the Gentiles and to the people Israel
17:18 -  he's a chosen one unto me God said and I'll tell you people we Jews have shrunk from the implications of the phrase the chosen people but praise God everyone in this room is a chosen one to bear light unto the Gentiles and to the people Israel
17:35 -  and God said go tell them what great things they must suffer for my name's sake I'll tell you of all of the offenses of the gospel when we come down to the ultimate nitty-gritty there's always someone who's going to stand to his feet as I experienced two days ago at the
17:50 -  University of Massachusetts when a rabbi got up bristling and he said are you trying to imply are you trying to imply that if I reject your Jesus that I'm going to hell that I'm going to burn for an eternity in hell have you ever experienced that doesn't
18:10 -  have that has that question come up in your witness or have you been shrinking from your witness in the fear that that question would come up we had a little bite to eat last night after the service and I'll tell you there's not a detail that comes into my life from a word of
18:30 -  conversation to being drawn to a single individuals in a certain affinity of the spirit to a book that comes into my hand to being called to a meeting or an invitation that's not ordered of God and that woman in the crowded dinner table in that restaurant happened to sit next to me with no accident
18:46 -  and I said to her she came from Little Rock I said do you happen to know any of the Jewish community there why yes she said as a matter of fact quite well and I said are they a rather withdrawn community or is there a really good fellowship you know between the Jewish people
18:59 -  and Christians there oh she said there's really quite a bit of you know socializing and fraternizing and that I myself should have you know several Jewish friends I said have you witnessed to them well gulp no I really haven't you said I really lack boldness I have to admit that
19:20 -  and I just couldn't bring myself to suggest to them that somehow that they were wrong or that they have to and I'm just paraphrasing now but this was the sum and substance of it that they have to see things particularly my way and I didn't want to offend them I didn't want to offend them
19:38 -  praise God for that very lovely kindness and the world loves that degree of kindness and concern but I'll tell you there's a God who has called us to more than sentimentality there's a God who has called us to love and it's not the love that makes
19:55 -  nice nice it's the love which speaks the truth in love and is willing to pay the price of love which is the painful forfeiture the risk of the loss of friendships the bringing of offense people were so nice to me for 34 years in America that I never met so much as a single individual
20:14 -  and I knew many who spoke to me about the gospel of Jesus Christ or the messiah of Israel I guess they didn't want to offend my feelings and were perfectly prepared therefore that when my life should come to its terminus and there were many narrow escapes that I would be plunged into an
20:34 -  eternal darkness and I would be one condemned to wailing and a gnashing of teeth people don't we believe the scriptures I didn't seek for any any ministry I didn't know what the word meant when it pleased the Lord to bring me into this university ministry
20:56 -  I obeyed though I knew I was well over my head and they invited me to the University of Illinois where there would be eight days of activity four to six meetings a day from fraternity houses and student union buildings and all kinds of places and I was taken by the hand from one meeting to
21:13 -  another just stunned out of my head exhausted I couldn't think straight and I just experienced the flow of God the power coming into my body over and beyond my own exhaustion and God giving me a choice word to speak on every occasion and souls being saved and a fantastic confrontation
21:29 -  at a Jewish fraternity house that lasted six hours at the conclusion of that week when they had called me long distance before the meetings art do you think you can handle this the only condition upon they're willing to have you is if you'll debate the professor of comparative
21:42 -  religion who's a notorious atheist who has subtitled his course laughing your way through the world's religions and who speaks hebrew and aramaic and greek and other semitic languages you think you can handle him why of course not
21:58 -  I can't handle him no more than I can handle any of those meetings and it's either going to be that it's no longer I that live but Christ who liveth in me or I perish there's only one reason why a pipsqueak like me wet behind the ears not yet 10 years old is standing
22:26 -  before an audience like this many of you two and three times older in the Lord than I but I've had experiences that would make your hair stand straight up and I've experienced the resurrection power of Christ again and again and again and that very night they made a mistake by allowing me to
22:46 -  speak first and I'll tell you that the moment I opened my mouth a holy hush fell in that crowded Jewish fraternity house that place was jammed to the rafters with Jews who had come to see me get my comeuppance as a traitor in their sight against the Jewish people at that meeting at the University
23:05 -  of Massachusetts the night before there were special posters put up by the hello committee a special meeting called at a certain hour what to do about the apostate I'm a traitor in their sight my own mother has slammed the door in my face and called me mad
23:24 -  and the moment I opened my mouth in that in that crowded place that holy hush fell and mouths were stopped and I went on in the power of the unction of God to begin to relate this foolish gospel about a half hour later some of the Jewish kids began to elbow and dig this professor who had not
23:38 -  opened his mouth he was stunned and silent and said aren't you going to answer this man and he got up and he made one or two lame apologetic remarks and he slipped out like a cur with his tail between his legs that man has since invited me to address his classes on two
24:00 -  subsequent occasions and they took a poll at the end of the year of all of the speakers that they had that the kids said that art cast was the most impressive but you and I know what they were impressed by when he left that meeting went on for six hours I've never seen such rage such anger
24:24 -  such bitterness Jewish kids got up out of their seats with disgust and anger and stormed out of that house they couldn't hear another word they wanted to stop their ears and three minutes later they came back in again they hated it but they couldn't stay away they were too Jewish
24:39 -  Laurie after four hours into that meeting and I saw I saw guys come out of their seat one kid came out of his seat with his fist nodded ready ready to bash me in my face and I just stood very quietly
24:56 -  he said of your God he said if your Jesus can save me as you say let him let me see him do it right this minute I looked at that boy and I opened my mouth and I heard myself saying brother your spirit stinks oh you say art where's that written in the manual
25:14 -  of how to witness the Jews what a question to come from people who believe in the Holy Spirit I want you to know that every utterance that came from the lips of Jesus was born of the Spirit of God and was bathed in love every single syllable even the cry to the Pharisees
25:37 -  hypocrite I'll tell you the loving remark is not always nice nice the loving remark might be repent else you shall all likewise perish that kid was the first one to be saved that night and he was followed by 14 other Jewish kids
25:58 -  in the first hearing of the gospel they were falling like flies on their knees and on their faces one kid came up to me trembling and weeping he said already said even my rabbi is afraid to pray for me because my name is cats you see my name is cats also and I used to be embarrassed
26:17 -  by it because you know the kinds of jokes to which that can lend itself and I thought boy of all the names to have where did we get that one I thought well that's something that we Jews must have picked up in in Germany somewhere in the course of our wanderings but when God saved me
26:31 -  he showed me in an instant what it means to be a man because I've been seeking my manhood all my adult life he showed me what it means to be a Jew it's to have the spirit of the Holy One of Israel in you and even told me what what his name Jesus Christ means and then he told me what my name means
26:48 -  cats is not even German it's not even Jewish it's Hebrew and it's a contraction of two Hebrew words Kohan Tzadik Koh and Tza makes cats if you know a Jew by the name of Kohen or Khan or some derivation of that that word means priest and Tzadik means righteous and this boy said my rabbi doesn't feel
27:12 -  qualified to pray for me because I'm a cat I'm a Kohen Tzadik I said that's okay brother I am one too and I'll pray for you I put my hand on his head and I said oh gracious God of Israel in the name of Jesus make this Kohan a true priest of Israel and that kid sagged and fell into a seat
27:31 -  he told me later that when I touched his forehead something went right through his body by the power of God and he had a set or he would have collapsed that's what God was doing by the power of his spirit because a mile away on campus there were 20 Christian kids on their faces before God for six
27:46 -  hours while the meeting was in progress from every denomination for getting their little doctrinal differences they knew that there was a war on and they were bombarding heaven for Jesus sake and when we picked those kids up at midnight I just we hadn't yet had a word to say to them
28:06 -  and their faces were just beaming with light and they were overjoyed and they said oh brother cats didn't wonderful things happen from 10 o'clock on I said how did you know they said because from six to ten we knew that there was a war on we can tell it now spirits but from 10 to 12 God
28:24 -  was doing glorious things precious people I have not yet begun my message and I've got something to say and I don't want to have to abbreviate it
29:03 -  in that same university series of university meetings that first one began at the student union building at one o'clock weeks before my coming all kinds of publicity had gone forth and special stickers had been
29:15 -  printed and were pasted all over the place cats is coming is one word cats is coming cats is coming and when I got there I was so embarrassed to see that they played up my name I said why did you do that well we prayed art and we felt that if we just made an abstract gospel invitation few
29:29 -  people would come let alone your own people but there are people are intrigued by personalities so we used your name I said man I said I'm nothing cats is coming and coming for what I'm not a Jewish Billy Graham and I'd like to be
29:48 -  so I remember that first meeting at that student union building one o'clock every day some radical comes to that microphone and sends out such fumes and such filth and such incitement of violence and from that same microphone we were going to begin our eight days of gospel meetings
30:02 -  and we all got together in a huddle and we prayed and they hugged me and they embraced me and they said go get him tiger and I got pushed out into the middle of that great crowded room 300 people and I was all alone then it's to remember it's no longer I that live but Christ
30:19 -  who liveth in me then to remember it's not your battle but mine saith Lord but go you out before them and I gave a message and I finished and I did a foolish thing I opened to questions and answers from the moment that I began for some reason my eyes were fastened on a guy who was directly in
30:39 -  front of me at the back of the room I just couldn't take my eyes off his face he was so cynical so wise aliki and sure enough when the question and answer period came he was the first one to raise his hand and he went like this to his colleagues okay fellas watch this I'll take care of this guy
30:52 -  right at the beginning hey Mr. Katz yes do you believe there's a hell watch this well as I got him now ha ha ha I wasn't prepared for that question as a matter of fact I wasn't prepared in any technical way for any question I didn't have a little book to which I could thumb what's
31:12 -  the answer to the question on hell and you know I was believing God I was coming out of a boat because the holy one of Israel bid me come and if his word could not sustain me I was ready to perish I breathe in my breath I said Lord you've got me into this now you answer and I opened my
31:30 -  mouth and here's what I heard myself saying I said brother even as an atheist if there was one thing that distinguished my life from earliest consciousness is that I've always had a high regard for the value of words now I tell you there's no figure in all scripture who shares
31:47 -  and expresses the significance in the profundity of words than the than the man Christ Jesus he himself warned us that we shall be held accountable for every idle word we speak and I tell you brother in the same breath that there's not a figure again in all scripture
32:06 -  who has spoken more consistently and more powerfully about hell about a lake of fire that shall never be quenched about an eternal darkness about a wailing and gnashing of teeth than Jesus Christ himself in one place in the Gospel of Mark five times he uses the phrase
32:27 -  a fire that shall not be quenched and I tell you brother that it behooves you who have asked this question to embarrass God's messenger to be reminded of the things which Jesus spoke lest you find yourself standing one day far sooner than you think before him hearing again
32:46 -  your vain question played back in God's answer which you ignored now too late to remedy the fire and the judgment and the eternal trembling and anguish of soul which he described those weren't my exact words but something to that effect and I'll tell you they went
33:04 -  forth by a very great unction and I watched this guy like an air being let out of a balloon just go he just folded up and collapsed and that was the beginning of eight days of meetings people I'm a believer almost 10 years I have yet to hear except out of my own mouth and that
33:24 -  recently any message on the judgment of God any message of a soon coming king who is coming to judge the earth any message that this world is condemned of God and that he's coming in fire to bring judgment upon a world that has long ignored and rejected him the consequences of
33:46 -  which are written in the conduct of men and nations in their depravity in their filth in their brokenness in their excess we've we've had a heart to see the great revivals of God and we read with great wistfulness the great exploits of men like Finney and Spurgeon the
34:08 -  great revivalist of times past they didn't just come and bring great times of enthusiasm and blessing to single congregations they shook entire communities cities were changed jails were emptied saloons were closed broken marriages were reconciled men were permanently and deeply
34:28 -  and profoundly converted by the ministries of men like a Charles Finney how different from our own age in an easy believism and a groovy gospel and Jesus emblazoned on t-shirts and making men rich in the production of cheap jewelry and suction cup things that are to fit on dashboards
34:50 -  and stickers to go on bumpers everybody's getting on the bandwagon having a ball I can't understand his enormous popularity in the vogue for Jesus because I know in my Jewish heart that the holy one of Israel has never been popular and well it is that he spoke through Dave Wilkerson at a recent
35:10 -  Lutheran Charismatic Congress when this brave man spoke the vision which God had given him of what shall soon befall this nation in the end times and of the fearful things which he spoke a coming persecution upon the saints of God governmental harassment of the ministries of God and the
35:29 -  ministers of God persecution of Catholic Charismatics out of their own denomination the honeymoon is going to be over and the Jesus movement which has had such great popularity in vogue is going to fold up its tent and silently creep away and those who are its loudest adherence
35:46 -  and most boisterous guitar strumming adherence are going to be the very persecutors of those that shall remain to go on as disciples bearing their cross for Jesus Christ my lord was never popular
36:03 -  but we've been preaching another kind of gospel and trying to induce people to accept him that somehow their lives might be made more groovy and we're continually reminded of the benefits and indeed who can speak of the benefits more so than I I'm as one whose life has been who has been
36:21 -  brought from death unto life there's not a thing that I want in God I who was a teacher and labored as a high school dropout to make good whose whole life has been been marked by frustration and defeat and failure came finally to a place where the master's degree degree from
36:38 -  the University of California at Berkeley and eminent in my profession and well received and tenure and couldn't be fired and annual wage increments and retirement benefits and medical insurance and even a happy little congregation that I to which I belonged and even a little
36:53 -  ministry on the side beside my teaching duties I had all this in heaven too and God said come follow me and led me out of that security while my wife was pregnant for the third time to enter full-time ministry with my Jewish people wondering how I would fare standing on a soap box in New
37:10 -  York preaching the gospel and what if I failed where would my security be then and how could I get by in a hundred bucks a week when I've been used to all of the advantages of of wage increments year by year and having our own home and car and all that stuff but now I don't even have a salary
37:27 -  now I don't even belong to an organization and I found out I didn't even keep track of it that this past year God poured forty thousand dollars into my life and ministry gave us a television program and and we've been everywhere in this past year and in recent months from

38:51 -  so dying many of us are embarrassed by references in the Bible to the anger or wrath of God and almost feel constrained to defend God from such unloving allegations we're quick to explain how that might perhaps characterize the God of the Old Testament
39:08 -  but never the God of the new oh foolish children who has deceived you don't you know the Shema YIsrael Adonai Eloheno Adonai echad hero Israel the Lord your God is one Lord there's only one God one Lord one faith one way and if I would have any criticism be it far from me for this

39:56 -  the deep calling and way of God for men who wanted only religions of convenience and are willing to accept the Jewish or Gentile equivalents that required nothing more than a few bucks in the collection plate or an Israel bond and allow them to go on being Lords unto themselves no power to
40:13 -  save and to keep men from the eternal judgment of God or to bring them to a place of eternal joy exchanging pulpits on Mother's Day and Thanksgiving and going through other honorific thing of exchanges of awards and making nice nice while the world
40:32 -  teeter-totters on the brink of eternal doom there's only one God and he's the same God that inspired the scriptures in the book of Isaiah
40:49 -  in the 13th chapter very appropriate to be read in this season in the sixth verse how ye for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs
41:08 -  and sorrow shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners
41:27 -  thereof out of it for the stars of the heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light and the sun shall be darkened and is going forth and the moon shall not cease cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will

42:54 -  and the presence of the ruach ha kodesh the holy spirit of God and it cannot save and I gave such an impassioned cry that day to call men to the true judaism of God even those sitting in the assemblies of God who were speaking the right words and had given mental assent to the right
43:11 -  creeds but were effectively practicing that other kind of judaism and some men got up in the middle of the message and cried out speak on prophet when I stood outside the door that day people walked by me with stricken faces oh a few dared venture those little words like oh I enjoyed your message
43:33 -  lovely preaching and my soul always curdles when I hear that kind of talk and a jewish man had been brought to that meeting by his gentile believing wife that day and he walked by me his face set as flint he wouldn't even acknowledge my existence he was

44:22 -  believe it's an easy thing to believe it's what you do that counts and he says as far as doing his concern he said I'm sure I find a proven God's sight I go to bat for the underdog I take free cases for the underprivileged I do this and I do that and he went on to speak to me the conventional
