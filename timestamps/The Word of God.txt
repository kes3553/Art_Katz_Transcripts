The Word of God

00:00 -  Can you hear all right? Yeah. I don't feel particularly inspired on the assigned topic.
00:23 -  Would you be disappointed if we spoke of something else? No. So let me pray.
00:34 -  Lord, be the Lord my God of this time. Turn it to the good. What is ever on your heart, my God, express it.
00:54 -  Take us beyond what we thought, my God, we would hear or speak. Give us a memorable and a significant occasion. Give my brother grace for it to interpret me and grace for me to interpret you.
01:12 -  And we bless you. We look to you. Come, my God, and delight your own soul.
01:20 -  In the name of Jesus, amen. Well, you're too far away. Are you translating?
01:31 -  Why don't you come here and help me here. Too stiff and too formal. Too stiff and too formal.
01:46 -  Too stiff and too formal. Which does not encourage the word of God. So we have to triumph over the circumstances.
02:04 -  The Lord is able. So don't look suspiciously at the speaker. And turn with me to Psalm 119.
02:21 -  Did you bring a Bible? No, he's not a good interpreter. You have to project your voice.
02:34 -  You have to give, speak to them. Did you bring a Bible? Raise your hand if you brought a Bible.
02:52 -  Psalm 119 is today's psalm for me. Because today is the 19th. Tomorrow I will read in the morning Psalm 120.
03:13 -  I read the Psalms daily. And so should you also. By the grace of God, I hope to show you what you're missing.
03:30 -  This is one of the longest of all the Psalms. Psalm 119. And celebrates the word of God.
03:46 -  Why don't you read the first four verses. You have to have a real ear for this. Because this is so contrary to our whole present modern mentality.
04:35 -  This is totally Hebraic. Totally Davidic. And yet there are few Christians who have a heart like this.
04:54 -  Remarkable that we can go back into the Old Testament. And find a statement of faith. Deeper than what we know as New Testament Christians.
05:12 -  Because the Lord never intended that we should separate the books. And David is as up to date and deep a man of faith as can be found in all the scripture. So blessed are those whose way is blameless.
05:49 -  And I am willing to wager that you have never even ever considered the word way. That's not in our modern minds. To think of no way that is blameless.
06:13 -  It's another mentality. But one that you should embrace. You will transform all your life.
06:26 -  To think of your faith as a way. A mode of being. That is blameless.
06:41 -  I'm speaking this for me. I wasn't satisfied that I gave this enough time this morning. So you can listen in on me.
06:59 -  You can listen as I contemplate myself what is being said. Unless you're not interested in being blessed. I could hardly believe that.
07:17 -  For there's only one other alternative to being blessed. Is being cursed. So choose the better thing.
07:31 -  For these things are written for us. That we should walk in the right path. Choose the better thing.
07:46 -  For these things are written for us. That we should walk in the way of God. Not in the way of the world.
08:00 -  This isn't just history. This is a current word. Absolutely appropriate for us now.
08:16 -  All you dear children. Open the Bible. And live.
08:25 -  Because I wasted my first year as a Christian. I thought I would bring my analytical skills to bear on the Bible. And I will do with the Bible what I did with Shakespeare.
08:43 -  What I did with Karl Marx. And I went nowhere. Until someone said, do you know what the whole purpose of the Bible is Art?
08:59 -  I said what? It's to teach us how to live. So evidently there is a way that is blameless.
09:19 -  Doesn't mean that we have to be perfect. But we can be without blame. How do you reconcile that?
09:34 -  That's the paradox of the faith. God is not calling us to some kind of impossible idealism. That we cannot attain a practical mode of living.
09:56 -  In which we can make a mistake. Even fail perhaps in a sin. And yet be without blame.
10:19 -  So happy are those whose way is blameless who walk in the law of the Lord. So happy are those whose way is blameless who walk in the law of the Lord. The word walk is repeated in verse 3.
10:37 -  Who also do no wrong, quit in a verse of the law, but walk in his ways. Walking is a distinct biblical word. It doesn't just mean ambulation.
10:55 -  But it's an all-inclusive word. Because you have to walk to the bedroom. You have to walk to work.
11:08 -  There's nothing you can do without walking. It's all-inclusive. And it's all important in God's sight.
11:21 -  Not just walking to the church on Sunday. But walking into the bedroom. Your relationship with your wife.
11:34 -  With your children. With your family. It's all included in walking.
11:47 -  There's a blessed way to walk. In his ways. Are his ways different from our ways?
12:00 -  The Bible says yes. My way is not your way. Nor are your thoughts my thoughts.
12:12 -  As great as is the distance from heaven to earth As great is the distance from my thoughts to your thoughts As great is the distance from my thoughts to your thoughts
12:22 -  And my way to your way. My way to your way. Listen, you children.
12:31 -  You came to hear a lecture on anti-Semitism. This is an important subject. But unless you're a believer
12:40 -  Walking in the way of God Whatever your mental intention However much you think you're free of fraudulence
12:49 -  You will yourself become anti-Semitic. Because the root of anti-Semitism Is not opposition to Jews
13:04 -  It's opposition to the God of the Jews It's opposition to the God of the Jews It's opposition to the God of the Jews
13:15 -  The God of David So God's provision Is to come into his way
13:27 -  And be blessed Verse 2 Verse 2
13:36 -  Verse 2 Blessed are those who keep his decrees Blessed are those who keep his decrees
13:45 -  Blessed are those who keep his decrees Do you see what kind of a God we have? Do you see what kind of a God we have?
13:54 -  He's not just talking about a mental understanding He's not just talking about a mental understanding Or subscribing to a legal code
14:03 -  Or subscribing to a legal code Adopting a Christian vocabulary Adopting a Christian vocabulary
14:12 -  Subscribing to correct doctrine To those who keep his decrees This is very actual
14:21 -  This is very actual This is very real Very literal
14:30 -  Very blessed If your country was made of people If your country was made of people
14:39 -  Who keep his decrees And walk in his ways You would not need to hear a lecture on anti-Semitism
14:48 -  You would not need to hear a lecture on anti-Semitism It would not be a Bulgarian problem It would not be a Bulgarian problem
14:57 -  It's only a problem for those who do not walk in his ways It's only a problem for those who do not walk in his ways Because
15:06 -  Those who keep his decrees Seek him with their whole heart For those who keep his decrees
15:15 -  Seek him with their whole heart That is a mouthful That statement is a mouthful
15:26 -  Are you having a problem with me? That is a mouthful Whole heart
15:43 -  Who seek him with their whole heart We have no idea what this means Because so little of what we do is whole hearted
16:01 -  That is a phenomenon of another kind To be so complete As to give you a whole heart
16:13 -  To anything Let alone God We are living inadequately
16:24 -  We are living shallowly We are like phantoms That are passing through the night
16:34 -  Appetites with legs Appetites with legs Appetites with hands
16:51 -  We are not blessed To be blessed is to live whole heartedly It changes everything
17:07 -  Everything takes on new significance Life becomes earnest Really serious
17:20 -  As God intended it Do you know why we drink? Have drugs?
17:29 -  That do all these things? Because we are not living rightly As God intended
17:39 -  With a whole heart We are partial Inadequate
17:48 -  We live small lives Appetites with legs The Bible is to teach us how to live
18:05 -  Whole heartedly And if we are not whole hearted with God Shall we be whole hearted with men?
18:19 -  Even our own husbands? Our own wives? With anyone?
18:32 -  So the same one who is whole hearted And keeps his decrees, his ways Seeks him with their whole heart
18:53 -  This is life This is salvation It's more than religion
19:03 -  God forbid it should be reduced to religion I say manner of living That is sane
19:15 -  And healthy And gratifying And real
19:24 -  And significant In a world that is false And full of lies
19:33 -  And deception And wants to keep you only as an appetite with legs But a like this in such a world
19:48 -  If his way is different from our way How shall we know it? In particular ways
20:00 -  In our decisions and choices That come up every day By seeking him
20:12 -  By seeking him Will you take my word for it? I'm asking, will you take my word for it?
20:24 -  There is a God who waits to be sought And he's not far from any one of us If you will seek him
20:43 -  If you will not Especially after you hear words like this I wouldn't trust you with any Jew
20:54 -  I would not trust you with any Jew I would not trust you with any Jew I would not trust you with any jewelry
21:06 -  With any jewelry Antisemitism, the hatred of the Jew Is the inevitable consequence
21:18 -  Of those who do not take God seriously Of those who do not take God seriously And really in their deepest thoughts despise him
21:33 -  And want to ventilate their anger and their hatred against God But because they can't lay their hands on him They'll lay their hands on those who represent him
21:48 -  The Jew Even in his own unbelief The Jew is the measure of the truth of our relationship with God
22:05 -  Because there's nothing natural about them That we should desire them In many ways they are offensive to us
22:21 -  Or irritating Unless our hearts are filled with God And his love for these people
22:33 -  Even when they themselves are out of the way Even when they themselves are out of the way His intention is to bring them back into the way
22:48 -  By the example that you will set for them By the example that you will set for them You will be more like David than they
23:02 -  If you take the God of David seriously To do it with a whole heart Verse 14
23:43 -  I delight in the way of your decrees Strange man, the Savior He not only does the things of God
23:59 -  He not only meditates upon the way of God He not only does what God says But he delights in it
24:13 -  That's a special word Do you have it? Not just for God
24:23 -  Do you have it for anything? Do you delight in nature? In the sun, flowers, seasons, animals, people, life, delight
24:44 -  What a word We are living beneath the intention of God We are living beneath what God has created for us
25:05 -  And what he has created We are not blessed, we are not blessed and we are not happy We have no delight
25:13 -  In God of both his ways In life itself One day is like another
25:26 -  Verse 15 What a strange man David must be To delight in the way of your decrees
25:44 -  As much as in all riches I will meditate on your precepts Fix my eyes on your ways
25:55 -  I will delight in your statutes I will not forget your word Have you noticed this?
26:04 -  I will, I will, I will, I will David is not a bump on a log That's an American idiom
26:15 -  David is not a bump on a log He is not a passive human being He is not an accident of circumstance
26:36 -  He is not a victim of his environment I will, I will meditate I will delight, I will do
26:47 -  I will, with a whole heart You want to be sons and daughters of David? It's available to you, mother
27:00 -  If you choose this way It waits for you to say I will And you know what I suspect?
27:15 -  There are many of you who are listening to me this afternoon Who have never asserted yourself Never made an I will
27:35 -  Life is happening to you You are not a victim of it You are not a judge of it
27:50 -  God is waiting to hear your I will You will choose his way As you are delight
28:03 -  You will be found of him You will be found of him It will change everything
28:13 -  It will bless you And bless Jews It's from many Christians
28:31 -  It's God's answer to anti-Semitism That it will make you different It will make you different
28:51 -  And people who liked you before Because you were like them Will now look at you differently
29:02 -  And suspiciously You'll become fanatical And too religious
29:11 -  You're not so much fun anymore You're so serious You take God seriously
29:20 -  You're even reading the Bible Every day Even the Old Testament
29:29 -  The Psalms That's fanatical You will be threatening to them
29:38 -  Because you're so different And the strange thing is you look happy doing it It's not a religious obligation
29:47 -  You enjoy Thinking about us You enjoy his words
29:56 -  You enjoy walking in the way You enjoy being blessed That it will bring criticism
30:05 -  That it will bring criticism By those who think you're going too far now By those who think you're going too far now
30:14 -  That's what it says here Take away from me Anger and contempt
30:34 -  If you will walk with God It will not please men They will scorn you
30:50 -  And rebuke you But the world calls them the accursed ones Accursed 21, the insolent
30:59 -  Accursed Take away from me their scorn and contempt Accursed
31:08 -  Take away from me their scorn and contempt Nothing has changed In every generation
31:17 -  Throughout the whole of human history Anyone who has chosen to walk with God Will offend men
31:26 -  And will bring their scorn upon you That's called walking in the way That's called walking in the way
31:38 -  David chose this way I will, he said I will
31:50 -  Verse 30, I have chosen the way of faithfulness Verse 32, I have chosen the way of faithfulness Verse 32, I have chosen the way of faithfulness
32:04 -  I have chosen the way of faithfulness You're a strange man Do you know what his name means?
32:13 -  Do you know what his name means? Beloved of God God loves David
32:22 -  He has a strong heart Who makes the choice And keeps it
32:31 -  He says I will, I will Not because it's a religious obligation I guess I have to
32:40 -  I choose to And it's even my delight I'll not just walk
32:56 -  I'll not just walk In your way I will run after it
33:05 -  I will not just walk In your way I'll not just walk
33:14 -  In your way I'll not just walk In your way
33:23 -  I will not just walk In your way I will not just walk
33:32 -  In your way It says in God's word Be holy as I am holy
33:48 -  It says in God's word Be holy as I am holy It says in God's word
34:01 -  Be holy as I am holy It's a way of living It's a mode of being
34:14 -  It's blessed Those who walk in this way And delighted it
34:23 -  And seek the Lord Because we need him This is not mechanical
34:34 -  This is not a way that is stipulated That we know at once and for all Step one, step two
34:44 -  Every day is another situation Think it then What shall we do?
34:53 -  How shall we act? What will please the Lord? We need to seek him
35:02 -  For direction For wisdom Isn't that what your city means?
35:11 -  Isn't that what your city means? Isn't that what your city means? Isn't that what your city means?
35:26 -  But you have it He himself is wisdom And the Bible says he gives wisdom
35:35 -  To those who ask liberally To those who ask for wisdom But are we asking?
35:47 -  Are we seeking? Are we walking in the way? If we Jews had seen more of this reality
35:56 -  If we Jews had seen more of this reality You would have restored us to our own God You would have restored us to our own God
36:05 -  There is nothing more impressive to a Jew There is nothing more impressive to a Jew Than to see a Gentile walking in the way of David
36:14 -  Than to see a Gentile walking in the way of David This is beyond religion This is beyond religion
36:23 -  It's the way of God And it takes the Spirit of God And it takes the Spirit of God
36:32 -  And it takes the Spirit of God In a living way That's why David cries out in Psalm 51
36:41 -  That's why David cries out in Psalm 51 Take not thy Holy Spirit from me Take not thy Holy Spirit from me
36:50 -  Let not thy presence be part from me Let not thy presence be part from me Create in me a clean heart
36:59 -  Do you like a man like this? Do you like a man like this? Does this impress you?
37:08 -  Now would you like to see more men like this? Who are jealous over God's presence Who are jealous over God's presence
37:17 -  Take not your Spirit from me Why was that important to David? Because if God took his Spirit from him
37:26 -  How shall we seek him? How shall we follow him in the way? How shall we have a delight in his word?
37:35 -  This is not human This is not religion This is life
37:44 -  And requires the Spirit of God Can you say that? Take not thy Holy Spirit from me
38:03 -  Let not thy presence be part from me Let not thy presence be part from me Come on, your children
38:12 -  Come on, you've got to be truthful God is the God of truth We can't play games with him
38:21 -  He sees us through and through Who of us can say in truth Take not thy Holy Spirit from me
38:30 -  Let not thy presence be part from me If we never have known that Holy Spirit Have never experienced that
38:39 -  How shall we be jealous to retain it When we have not yet known it When we have not yet known it
38:55 -  Well, what has this to do with anti-Semitism, brother? Everything This is God's answer
39:07 -  Not a program Not new principles Knowledge but a way
39:19 -  Blessed are they who walk in the way They will be blameless Toward Jews
39:30 -  And toward anyone Because they're walking in God's way It's a walk
39:42 -  It's a school On the job It's a mode of being
39:54 -  I'm demonstrating it right now How do you mean? Well, I was assigned the topic
40:06 -  Anti-Semitism The coming anti-Semitism Which is important
40:15 -  On a daily basis I was assigned the topic Which is important
40:24 -  And it indeed is coming So the anti-Semitism That I'm speaking something else
40:33 -  Because I had no freedom In my spirit To stick to the assigned subject
40:42 -  But to speak from Psalm 119 Because I'm walking in the way Because I'm walking in the way
40:51 -  Having sought the word this morning This is what he's unfolding Because we true preachers
41:00 -  Because we true preachers Because we true preachers Are recalled not only to speak the truth of the way
41:09 -  Are recalled not only to speak the truth of the way Are recalled not only to speak the truth of the way But to demonstrate it
41:18 -  Do you like to live like that? You have one thought God has another
41:27 -  What will you do? Will you choose your convenience? The expectation of men
41:36 -  Who do the will of God And trust him That you might be blessed
41:45 -  And be a blessing So let me pray That his words will not fall to the ground
42:09 -  He brought you here By your interest in the subject But he had another intention
42:18 -  Deeper than your own And more primary And more primary
42:27 -  How shall you be to the Jews what you must? And all the world will increasingly hate them And all the world will increasingly hate them
42:36 -  When you are not first right with God When you are not first right with God When you are not first right with God
42:45 -  And have not his soul And have not his soul Or his presence
42:54 -  I'm going to pray for that I'm going to pray for that So let's look to the Lord
43:04 -  We ask your mercy Lord You know every soul You know every soul
43:13 -  That you have gathered before you this afternoon We ask that you would form your own congregation We ask that you would form your own congregation
43:22 -  And you have done so And you have done so And set before them what you will
43:31 -  So we're asking mercy my God To break through The pride
43:40 -  Indifference Unwillingness And to bring your spirit and life
43:49 -  Into every soul that will Into every soul that will Follow you all the way
43:58 -  And become sons and daughters of David And become sons and daughters of David The way of blessing
44:07 -  The way of blessing So look upon us You know the truth of our condition
44:16 -  You know the truth of our need You know those of us who are only Christians in name only
44:26 -  We have never sought you We have never sought to walk in your way We've been satisfied with ourselves as we are
44:39 -  We never took your word seriously We don't read it We don't believe it
44:49 -  We don't desire to do it We are not wholehearted We're falling short of your glory
44:58 -  And I'm not even living humanly And we ask your forgiveness And that you would grant us
45:10 -  Forgiveness For not taking you seriously And being wards unto ourselves
45:19 -  And being wards unto ourselves Walking in our own way Doing our own thing
45:28 -  Seeking our own pleasure And ignoring you completely Cleanse us from that
45:40 -  By the only way in which we can be cleansed By the blood which you shed at the cross The reason for which you said you had come
45:52 -  To take away the sins of the world And of Bulgaria And of those in Sofia
46:01 -  Who have come to this meeting Will you ask him where you are sitting Will you ask him where you are sitting
46:10 -  To forgive you That the indifference to God is a sin That it constitutes rejecting Him
46:29 -  And making your own self Lord This man will make his own self Lord Ask him where you are sitting
46:42 -  Forgive me Lord Cleanse me Lord I receive what you have performed at the cross
46:53 -  Purge me of all my iniquity I have lived so shallowly So inadequately
47:03 -  Because I have not taken you seriously I have not been wholehearted Created in me a clean heart
47:15 -  In the words of David Renew in me a right spirit Put your Holy Spirit within me
47:25 -  And give me the sense of your presence So that I may walk in your way And take the light in your word
47:37 -  And be a person for your name Save me In Jesus' name
47:49 -  Amen You can recite from verse 30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness
48:07 -  I have set your ordinances before me And verse 32 I will run the way of your commandments
48:19 -  I will run the way of your commandments I will run the way of your commandments I will run the way of your commandments
48:30 -  Before you enlarge my understanding You know what true Christianity is? Not what you think it is
48:41 -  Not what we have been religiously told This is the way of David And it requires the Spirit of God
48:52 -  That He imparts to those who call upon Him And seek Him God's answer to antisemitism
49:09 -  Is the Spirit of God Which is the love of God The truth of God, the righteousness of God
49:20 -  The mercy of God How shall that hate Jews? But to them what we want
49:32 -  Even if it should cost them something As it will How will God identify His people at the end of the age?
49:44 -  How will He separate the sheep from the goats? And saying to the righteous Enter the kingdom prepared for you
49:55 -  And to the wicked be cast into the lake of fire Prepared for the devil and for his angels What separates the sheep from the goats?
50:07 -  One question What did you do for the least of these, my brethren? What did you do for the least of these, my brethren?
50:20 -  When did we see you hungry and thirsty and naked? If you have not done this unto the least of my brethren You have not done it unto me
50:37 -  The issue of Jesus is the issue of His people The Jews When they shall become the least of His brethren
50:51 -  Your response to them Will determine your eternal destiny At a time when they will be hated everywhere
51:05 -  Who will stand for them? Who will identify with them? Who will aid them?
51:17 -  And they called the Jew lover And suffered in prison at the worst Just as it was in the Nazi time
51:29 -  So will it be at the end of the age Who will stand with them? And extend mercy?
51:40 -  And run the risk of their own life? The sons and daughters of David In whom the Spirit of God is
51:52 -  And walk in the way of righteousness Where there is no other alternative to them What is the way of God?
52:03 -  And the Lord will know those who are His This is more than religion They will separate the sheep from the goat
52:15 -  Although some of them say, Lord, Lord When did we see you hungry and thirsty? He says, depart from me, I never knew you
52:29 -  The issue of our attitude towards the Jew The issue of our attitude towards the Jew Is the truth of our relationship with God
52:42 -  Is the truth of our relationship with God They are in the world in every nation They are in the world in every nation
52:54 -  To set us and to reveal it They are in the world in every nation To set us and to reveal it
53:05 -  Sentiment will not do it Only the love of God That cannot be offended
53:17 -  And will take every risk For righteousness sake Moving toward this conclusion of the age
53:29 -  Near religion will not be enough Near sentiments will not be enough Only the Spirit of God
53:41 -  For those who walk in the way And are strong in the knowledge of God Because they walk with their whole heart
53:52 -  And seek Him And grow in His Word And the knowledge of Him
54:04 -  Daily This is not a new Gospel It is the Gospel
54:17 -  But we have not heard it We have not been wholehearted So I want to pray again
54:32 -  For the Church of Bulgaria And this city For I know that much will be required of it
54:44 -  With regard to the Jew In the last days In the time of Jacob's trouble
54:55 -  In the rising anti-Semitism Growing up again all over the world For the only people who will resist it
55:07 -  Are those who are strong in the Lord And in the knowledge of His Word And we have got to choose it
55:18 -  I will, I will, I will, David said And we need to say also So Lord I pray for the Church
55:30 -  That it might be the Church indeed And it may well be that those who will oppose us From that religious world
55:41 -  And they are threatened by us Because our faith is so real We have the joy of the Lord
55:53 -  Even in hard circumstances And we are identified with that hated people The Jew
56:05 -  So bless the true Church Friends and daughters of David Who walk in the way
56:16 -  By the Spirit With a whole heart and take delight in it Oh, bless these children Lord
56:28 -  Stir up and raise up a people for your name Even out of this room Let them leave this room with a rejoicing
56:39 -  With a new hope And a faith born in them Because they have sought you
