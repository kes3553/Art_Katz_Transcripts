True and False Prophets 1

00:00 -  So to speak on false prophets, and I don't know that I've ever done so publicly, but I think the hour has come when that kind of a word is needed, but because of circumstances this morning and various other influences, I think the Lord would have me to begin with
00:15 -  something about a true prophet, and then we can make, have a basis for comparison. One of the fundamental distinctions that needs to be made is the difference between the gift and the office.
00:26 -  We're in such a place of immaturity that we can't even distinguish the one from the other, and so much of what has been said earlier in the dining hall really refers to the gift. Well, I want to speak exclusively about the office.
00:42 -  The gift is very prominent and granted to many, but the office is rare and few, and it behooves us to be able to recognize it when it comes, to anticipate it and to welcome it.
00:55 -  It has everything to do with the man. It's a permanent thing, it's not an on-and-off, and the man has got to be groomed and formed for its performance.
01:06 -  It's an office of ultimate and enormous responsibility because prophetic office brings the oracles of God. I don't know, the last time I've heard anyone use the word, I use it frequently, and that's
01:20 -  how I distinguish between presumers who purport to be the real thing and those who in fact are. If you'll notice that men who are being celebrated as being the oracles of God or the prophet
01:32 -  of the hour have very little to say that it's oracular. What do you mean by oracles? I mean the hefty, weighty, zoltan shawang, only the Germans could have a word for it,
01:44 -  all embracing cosmic view of the purposes of God as they are reflected and to be understood in the particular of this historic moment in the light of Scripture. Men who are being celebrated as prophets have biblical things to say, but they're not oracular
02:02 -  things. So that's one way in which we can distinguish the truth from the false. The prophet speaks for God with words from God by the authority of God, and he speaks
02:13 -  it to a generation that is troubled and is a final generation, and needs to have an expansive and insightful view of the meaning of its own time and its purpose, to review something of God's heart and its purposes to his people and the things that are set in the context
02:33 -  of the things that are future and eternal. That's the cosmic view that the prophet brings. That's the all embracing thing, and that liberates us from being fixed in time and culture and
02:43 -  place, because he shows us the thing that's immediate, but he sets it in the context of what is ultimate and eternal, and he brings in fact the reality of eternity into the consciousness of his hearers.
02:55 -  He's a man who, so to speak, comes out of eternity. He doesn't come to us out of time. He's not the product of Brooklyn, New York, or the depression generation, although those
03:05 -  are factors in his making, but the word that he bears comes out of a council, out of a sense of God and his heart that goes beyond time and place and culture. And because it does, it's liberating for the church that hears that.
03:21 -  Church needs, or it will be invariably caught in its own generation, its own time, its own temper. It needs the expansive, liberating sense of the things that are eternal, particularly
03:32 -  if it's a final generation called to monogam, if it's called to great sacrifice and cost. How shall we embrace that and give ourselves to it, except with the joyous anticipation that there is an eternal crown, there's a glory of an eternal kind, an invisible weight
03:47 -  of glory, the things that Paul saw that are eternal, we need also to see. The prophet brings that, and all that he brings, he doesn't bring as categories, he brings it as a kind of reality that makes a requirement of the hearer, because it's a searing thing
04:04 -  to us for the things that are eternal and forsake the things that are rooted in time, where our security is, where our comfort is, where our reputation is, and all of the kinds of things that want to pin us in time and place and keep us from the realm of apostolic
04:20 -  and prophetic realities where God's glory is to be found. So the speaking of a prophetic man is not just an instructive thing, it's a demanding thing, it's a requiring thing, and for that reason you're not likely to hear him, because
04:33 -  there are a few pastors that are willing to have such a one come, and probably one of the great issues of our generation, the last, is the issue of the inevitable conflict between pastors and prophets, because the pastoral heart wants to protect, wants to
04:49 -  keep, wants to soothe, wants to comfort, wants to shepherd, and the prophetic heart wants to uproot and pluck up and tear up and bring down, so how do we reconcile where the pastor has the courage to allow such a man to have his liberty and feel that he could work with
05:07 -  what has been said and that it's something that is needful, however painful, and it's not going to shadow either the man's ministry or his church or his congregation or whatever the vested interest might be, these are some of the tensions of our generation.
05:25 -  Well is such a man then likely to be rejected, he's likely to have doors closed in his face, I asked the brother not long ago, who is reputed to be a prophet, and whom I've known over the years and I've been an actual influence in his life, I said how is it that I'm not
05:41 -  myself invited to your prophetic conferences, and he said well, and I said because I've been in this longer than any of you, he said well the fact of the matter is art, the reason you're not invited is because you're not an in-house prophet, you're not one of the boys,
05:58 -  you can't be counted on to go along, you're liable to say something that will cross the grain of what our conference is about, and I'm not saying any of this to draw any attention to myself or make this an object of pity, it's just I'm wanting to say it's the name
06:15 -  of the game, rejection is the name of the game, however effectual men are in rejecting God has his remarkable way of getting his man in his place for his purpose and his time to bring the oracular statement of God, however much it will inconvenience or upset men, but
06:34 -  he's got to have a flinty face, he's got to be able to bear rejection, misunderstanding, all the kinds of things that attend the prophetic function and the call, and for that reason his preparation, the preparation of the man is more incisive and demanding than I would
06:51 -  say the preparation of a teacher or the preparation of a person that God will employ for the operation of the gift of prophecy, more than anything else the prophetic office is the man as the thing in itself, not only what he says but it's what he is, he is the thing
07:10 -  in himself as also the apostle and therefore the preparation has got to be more exacting and intensive than I think with other callings, so to receive a man like that is often an hour or a day of decision requires a response that is fateful and will determine and affect
07:34 -  all the future therefore there's a trembling and most Christians I think would be reluctant to open themselves to that kind of an experience and what makes the prophet foundational together with the apostle these are the foundations of the church is that he communicates not
07:56 -  only an understanding about God and about the purposes of God and the things that are eternal but he communicates the sense of God himself as God and I don't know that I have words to describe that, words to explain that, all I know is that there are times often hearing
08:12 -  other ministers and speakers speak that I am somewhat chaste in the inner man because I sense that no matter how serviceable that statement is and brings a certain information of value something is happening with it that is deprecating with regard to God himself
08:34 -  you know that even the volume of speaking tends to diminish God, more silence would be more God honoring than more speaking so when I hear voluble men often with a gift of death and profuse words however instructive and true I'm not discarding that my sense
08:54 -  is that there's a loss however great the gain there's a loss with regard to God himself the understanding of God as he is in himself which so few have and what we're doctoring and nursing is more often than not a sense of God that is our own subjective picture
09:16 -  but not what he is in himself you understand how urgent that is and how rare that is and how that needs to be contended for and how our own subjective fancy and the things that we bring in color and affect the way we view God everything that we hear about God will
09:32 -  influence that so one of the great functions foundationally brought by an oracular prophetic man or an apostle is the sense of God as he is in himself you may not even have that as a subject but something about the way in which the man communicates himself the way
09:50 -  in which he bears himself resonates something of that reality that's one way that you'll be able to tell true and false prophets or apostles because the ones that are false cannot bring that because it's a quotient and a dimension that you cannot obtain by human endeavor it's
10:08 -  something that is inglorious something given in the places of suffering and sacrifice in the history that such a man has with God that is not afforded to many if we lose that sense of God of that sense is not communicated by these foundational men then what is our foundation
10:30 -  what is our real knowledge of God and what are we purporting to believe and to communicate to make known to others if our own sense of God as God is diminished or at fault or wanting so this is inseparable from what the man is in himself and the history that he's had with
10:52 -  God the kinds of feelings through which he has passed and there's no way to communicate that the Lord draws the shade these are things that we cannot peer into this is not to be communicated and I was chuckling this morning hearing these these episodes out of the past
11:09 -  and I had almost completely forgotten that go back 20 years and then it came back in a flash as I'm hearing the account and remind me that that happened also on top of this this this and this that also happened yes so praise God one of the one of my great benefits is a very short
11:29 -  memory because if I had to carry the weight of the voluminous things of these last 36 years I would topple so the Lord is very selective but I appreciate the reminiscences when they come a little instance of the kinds of dealings of events of challenges of the operation of the cross of
11:47 -  painful confrontations of facing things that leave you staggered with your jaw open your you don't know how to answer are the kinds of things that go into the making of such a one don't desire this office if you are cross-resistant because it's an invitation to an exquisite suffering
12:06 -  suffering of a very particular kind that necessarily is intrinsic to that call and if the church is called if you prophetic to what degree then must we make room for these realities in our corporate life in fact the church itself rightly understood is a suffering and if it becomes a place of
12:25 -  pleasure before it's a place of suffering we're probably in error and the suffering is not from something external it's something from within the very nature of churches church the frictions what it's what was they'll describe this morning these well-meaning men these zealous and ripping
12:40 -  me up who was actually a factor in their inspiration and in their growth those those conflicts are unavoidable they're painful and there's no way out around them but through them that's what the church is and that's why we have to love it in order to bear it so the prophetic men is not only
13:09 -  subject frequently to rejection but he's often himself an offense I've noticed over the years that in some of the most portentous occasion that something would slip in inadvertently into the speaking or something I don't know what to give anyone in the hearing a reason to reject the word
13:32 -  by finding faults in the messenger I don't like his manner of speech he's too aggressive comes on too hard he's too accusative he's too out of the what his style his accent his manner I noticed that there's always a prophetic offense something structured in the man something that comes out in
13:54 -  the course of his communication that if someone wants to void and negate that which he brings they could find justification in lashing on to that point of offense so it's not a comely thing to be an object of offense as well as an object of rejection you become a kind of think and
14:13 -  strange odious thing with a strange reputation fearful and and that's part of it I'm looking over some notes that you can find on my website called the prophetic call which I'm trusting will be published soon enough in a book it deserves to and I'm just touching some of the highlights
14:40 -  if you'd like to look at the entire thing for yourself www.benIsraelasoneword.org organization and you'll see a number of things as a whole book on apostolic foundations there's a prophetic statement on Princess Diana's funeral which I expected somehow for the church to make but
15:01 -  there was a strange pervasive eerie silence even from the church in England but this event cannot go without some comment this cannot go unattended with this global event celebrated world over to give this jet-setter Islamic boyfriend running lady a Christian burial
15:22 -  as if she somehow is in the faith and represents Christianity by the highest clerics in the land in the Cathedral of Canterbury with a flag at half-mast at Buckingham Palace that kind of thing that has was globally televised and I vowed not to watch it but was up at 4 o'clock in the
15:41 -  morning there was my wife glued to the set because she loves royalty God bless her and I could not help but look in when I saw and heard the speeches the honorific things are being said again something in the inner man this is where the the prophet has his mode of being it's in in the guts and
16:00 -  the kishkes as we say in the Jewish vernacular and I knew that some statement had to be made and I won't say that the statement that I have made is the finest that could be made but it's a statement because it would been silent in a global event like that prophetically is to bring a condemnation
16:16 -  upon the church itself and it's prophetic responsibility to attend to the things in the history and in time for the nation we have to interpret to the nation the meaning of their own events and it's done so long as no one else had attempted it I have and you'll find it on the
16:32 -  website so a great deal is said about prediction by people who are on the subject of prophecy of prophets and in fact I've never in my 36 years and probably more than a quarter of a century I think functioning in this call seen the subject become more popular than it is today more and
16:59 -  more comment made about it more men alluding to be in it or being referred to as being it so we need to be very jealous then that we don't misunderstand this or attribute to men what is not there or think that the reputation or their calling is relative to the validity or the
17:33 -  accuracy of their prediction so I hear some say something like if they're hitting 75% or 80% what you want 100 so don't be unrealistic if they're if they're doing that well that's sufficient to justify them as prophets I sent out a letter a circular letter to 50 men who are involved in
17:54 -  the prophetic call and I said in my opinion the issue of being prophetic is not the issue of predictive accuracy not the issue prediction at all it's the issue of oracular statements interpreting the present time in the context of scripture in the light of God's eternal purpose
18:14 -  so be careful about the issue of prediction though it may well be that God may call a prophet had to make forecast it's not the same in itself as it is now increasingly celebrated to be the message of the prophet the true prophet the way it can be distinguished from the false is the false will
18:40 -  invariably bring an upbeat tone a positive word an encouraging word a flattering word the true prophet is more likely to bring the word of judgment and devastation a word of impending doom this is what has separated historically the prophets of Israel the true from the false those
18:58 -  who spoke of an impending judgment that was unavoidable that must come and others who said no peace peace when there is no peace the first call of Samuel was a child under the tutelage of the high priest Eli came with a word of judgment and when he spoke that to Eli that set in motion
19:20 -  the process by which it was fulfilled and in time Israel came to know that God had brought a prophet to Israel because God did not allow his words to fall to the ground because he did not allow God's word of judgment to fall to the ground bore it and spoke it so the word of judgment the
19:37 -  word of devastation is uncomely it's not pleasant to bring people don't want to hear it the flesh shrinks from its consideration and I am presently engaged in exactly that thing right now speaking of a coming calamity and judgment for the present state of Israel and Jews worldwide and speaking
19:58 -  it in places where people have a sympathy for that present state and wanted to see it humanly to succeed and having to tell them no it's slated for devastation it was not meant our intended to succeed but to reveal to Israel its own implacable inability in its humanity to become the thing that
20:17 -  God intends that only he can perform it when it is raised up out of death in resurrection that's an unpopular word it's a resisted word and when we spoke it in Israel had a conference on the coming calamity of Israel how'd you like to have a conference with that as a title where no messianic
20:34 -  fellowship or church that has known me for a quarter of a century would open its doors to that we had to conduct it at our own hotel and not one soul came who I've whom I've known for a quarter of a century but one lady who came to harass me while I was speaking and when I came home from
20:50 -  that conference there was a letter waiting for me signed by 13 of the most eminent leaders in Israel condemning me as false prophet that a man harassing the church and giving aid to the enemy because I spoke of a necessary coming calamity for that nation here's what I want to say things
21:07 -  and I'm and I just came back from South Africa and I've been saying this everywhere I've never seen an hour or a moment when the issue of true or false prophets is not more significant than now because if I'm false and speaking of an unnecessary calamity and bringing alarm and
21:23 -  confusion where it needs not be sounded then that that is a serious offense but if the true prophetic word is coming calamity for which there's no expectation and no preparation and it comes suddenly as it will come upon an unprepared body of Christ let alone the people
21:45 -  of Israel then it would be a drastic error not to have sounded the word in advance of the event so who's right then the ones who are saying no peace peace that Israel will work its way out of this and there'll be the differences with this Palestinian Arab neighbors will be reconciled
22:04 -  well this lonely voice that says no that's the stage that God himself has set this is what Israel has set by its own grasping Jacob nature to seek to establish out of its own Jewish prowess that which could only be given by God and it must have a faithful devastation and out of that and an
22:21 -  expulsion again into the nations will come a return by the same God who judged so also will he restore that he might be glorified not only in Israel but before the face of all nations one of us is right and one of us is wrong so we've come to an hour where it's no longer a matter of opinion
22:38 -  and where our propensity is and what opinion we would favor the critical question is who is the prophet of God and who is not and yet saying peace peace and healing the wounds of his daughter lightweight so the issue of prophetic credibility and of identification has never been more urgent
23:00 -  than it is now in this hour and for that reason I believe God is wanting me to share on this subject so well as I know anything about it so the prophet is called to pluck up and break down the things that are dear to men their religious tradition the false things that they
23:17 -  have celebrated for generations the things they want to cling to because it has to do with their identity their dignity the way in which they even see themselves the way in which they will even see God the most devastating thing about this book on the Holocaust is not the issue of the
23:32 -  Holocaust past that of the Nazi time or the Holocaust future of the time of Jacob's trouble the most devastating thing about that book is the issue that it raises about God himself as God where was God where where is the God whom we know to be kind and loving benevolent when six million
23:49 -  of his covenantal people are being systematically annihilated a million and a half of which are children where is God it brings God into review it brings the whole our understanding into a searching examination that is painful we might be willing to give up other ground we might be
24:08 -  willing to consider other things but when our view of God is assaulted when that apple cart is turned over and we have to see God in the sense of God in this judgment and ruthless judgments in his wrath in his anger and we don't know how to reconcile that with what we understand of him in
24:26 -  his patience and his kindness and his love we're in for a remarkable shaking in the deep so that in a man which in my own opinion is long overdue because the shallowness of the church and the lack of the fear of God that marks its conferences the absence of this one and generally characterizes
24:46 -  our modern-day Christendom at its best has everything to do with an inadequate knowledge of God as God because we have omitted God in his judgment and wanted to major only in those aspects of his personality that we find accommodating and warm but if we omit judgment we omit righteousness
25:05 -  we permit the heart of God the seamless garment of God where you cannot separate out one attribute from another but we need to receive him whole we have to eat the whole lamb and that's just the parts that appear to our appetite and the issue of God's judgment brings the issue of God before
25:23 -  us in a depth of consideration as no other subject can and nowhere will we see the issue of judgment more profoundly than in God's dealing with Israel both historically presently and in the future can your knowledge of God make way not only for the nasty Holocaust that that was not just some
25:41 -  historic aberration some accident in time with some freaky character by the name of Hitler came to power and set in motion the process of annihilation but that God himself was actually fulfilling his will and his word and that this was only an instrument in his hand a rod of his
25:58 -  chastisement but the God himself was the author of that devastation can you believe that and can you believe that within the same century another Holocaust shall come that elite that will eclipse the Nazi time that that most of the Jews who are alive in the world today in Chicago Rockford
26:14 -  Minneapolis and Los Angeles of Moscow where they are will perish and only a fraction of remnants will survive and become the redeemed of the Lord who returned to Zion and we're going to witness that with our own eyes the the unbelievable devastation of world Jewry in modern times a
26:33 -  second time in this same century and where will the church be then when that's taking place where will the nations be if they will not be a do safe in any place in the world what will our condition be in this country and what kind of a church then will stand in such a time and be able to
26:49 -  sucker such a people and identify with them in their time of greatest crisis and trial at the risk of their own life these are the urgent questions that are prophetic so when I hear a prophetic conference and men celebrated as the oracles of the hour and there's not a whisper a
27:06 -  scintilla of anything about Israel and the church in the last days I know it's so facto that no matter whatever else is being performed that is not prophetic it may be fortune-telling it may be clairvoyance it may even be the gift of prophecy might even yes bring to individual some personal
27:23 -  word that they'll travel all kinds of distances to hear to receive but it's not prophetic in the sense that we have heard something needful for the church in this hour in the crisis that is before and that is intending to omit that subject is to be disqualified prophetically speaking in my
27:41 -  opinion and you know what you'll hear about that you're off on a tangent art you've lost the center you would be preaching Christ and you're occupied with Israel that's because you're Jewish but what the poor staffs don't know is that the issue of Israel's restoration Israel's preliminary judgment
28:06 -  Israel's return in exhibiting both the severity and the mercy of God that permits the Lord who is contained in the heavens to become their King when they were restored to Zion is the issue of Christ is the issue that glorifies him and that's why Paul ends Romans 11 with all the depth of the
28:23 -  riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God for unto him to him and through him are all things to whom be glory forever the issue of Israel prophetically propounded not sentimentally is the issue of God's glory forever the celebration of Christ as King and ruler theoretically over his
28:45 -  creation it's not some narrow interest in some ethnic racial identity because I happen to share it it is the larger ultimate consummating purpose of God that concludes the age brings the King brings his kingdom brings his glory and that's not preaching Christ and yet the man who will
29:03 -  bring it will be accused of being off on a tangent or will be accused of many things so be prepared for accusation be prepared for charges when people don't want to hear the kinds of things that are painful to consider the destructive word before the word of restoration and by the way those
29:24 -  prophets that have preceded me the true ones who are called the prophets of doom Jeremiah Isaiah Ezekiel are also the same prophets to whom God gave the privilege of speaking the word of restoration so we will be disqualified to speak a word of comfort in Isaiah 40 comforting comforting my
29:43 -  people if we have not first told Israel their sins and Jacob their transgressions if we have withheld ourselves from bringing necessary words of judgment or the warning of impending judgment we will be disqualified to bring the word of comfort and I'll tell you that it is not a people
30:00 -  on the earth who can bring the word of comfort in the midst of Israel's crisis they will not survive it at all somebody has got to say to them in the wilderness place your God will come he will vindicate you when there's no no visible evidence of such a God on the horizon but all there is is
30:18 -  the grim reality of a wilderness of being stretched out of being have been uprooted of having lost all and expiring in a broken and shattered condition someone has got to say to them at that moment your God will come he will save you he will extricate you and that's more than just a nice word that's
30:37 -  that's a prophetic word because when they hear that word the word has become an event the lame leaf the eyes of the blind are open the water breaks forth out of the dry ground such is the power of prophetic proclamation to those who have not withheld their speaking of the hard word of
30:55 -  judgment that they can bring the word of comfort that is more than a placating but is an event that actually heals and delivers got the idea the word of a prophet is an event the word of a prophet is a requirement but it's an event that destroys before it blesses brings down before it raises
31:18 -  up and he's got to speak it unstaringly laying bare false foundations without fear or the regard of man because the fear of man is the most paralyzing factor that reduces a church and controversy its ability to be the prophetic entity of God in the earth the fear of man and
31:48 -  I'm not just talking about man in the world I'm talking about man in the church man in the system man in the pew the fear of our neighbors the fear of how we are seen how we are regarded how we are received how we are considered it's probably the most mitigating and compromising factor that has
32:05 -  kept many for my full obedience to God the prophetic man has got to come to the place of real death that total death by which that fear alone is executed because of that fear is alive the prospect for compromise for the reduction of the word as event follows the word has got to be spoken
32:26 -  unsparingly without fear of how you will be considered how you will be understood how you will be received show me a people who have come to a place of such freedom in God that they are totally immune to the way in which they are viewed by other Christians that's the cross thing only
32:47 -  the cross can perform that kind of devastating work because the man who brings the devastating word must himself first be devastated because we're all subject we're all susceptible to wanting approval wanting recognition and the freedom from that only comes with the totality of death that
33:06 -  has already been mentioned today and in fact it's the word of the prophet that brings that death I loved when when Dale said when he heard that message from me on unit for Christ's sake he was not just hearing a message but the message was an event and the very favor of death and the
33:22 -  chill of death went right into his soul to bring death well if we're going to be a prophetic people that speaks to the dry bones that they might live to bring life by our word resurrection by our word we need also to bring a word that brings the death and we will not be able to bring it to any measure
33:44 -  beyond what we ourselves have experienced in the reality of God so these institutions now that are springing up that are producing profits with a three-month course or a program I know we have a prophetic school ourselves every summer you're invited this is our 25th anniversary this summer
34:06 -  but we don't purport to produce profits we only we only seek to aid help encourage share and not necessarily those who have prophetic callings only but to bring the prophetic sense of the issues of the of the church that are becoming to it in its prophetic responsibility so the
34:28 -  prophet blows the whistle on the things that are false he has to have such an intense love of the truth he has to rinse when he feels that truth is being curtailed there's something about it there's a fire in the man for the issue of truth for integrity for things as they are for
34:51 -  reality as it is and that's why before the Son of Man could speak to the dry bones and Ezekiel 37 had to be brought out and down by the hand of the Lord in the spirit of God into the valley of dry bones and he had to have his face rubbed into the grip of the death of Israel which his flesh did
35:11 -  not want to consider he had to go into a valley the valley of dry bones is a place of depression and that's what we shrink from we don't want to see or consider depressing things and that's where truth is before it's glorious that's where it is and if we're not going to see with God the thing
35:29 -  as he sees it whether it's about our church our condition the nation our locality our marriage our personality our ministry will not be able to speak for him they were called seers before they were called prophets and it needs to be a ruthlessness about our own unwillingness to see
35:46 -  and consider hard things it's painful for the flesh and a displeasure for men but those things must be addressed the difference between the false and the real needs to be contended for have you ever been in a place where everyone is having a ball and it's all amens and hallelujahs
36:14 -  and it seems like a glory time and you're the only one that if you think like Elijah I'm alone I'm left who is groaning you're the only one whose kickers are knotted and there's an anguish in your soul a prophetic anguish because while everyone else is celebrating you're Winston why can't you
36:32 -  enter into that celebration because it's a false celebration because it's a pseudo thing because it's a machination because it's a humanly prompted soulish kind of a thing that everyone is enjoying but you know intuitively instinctively and deeply it's false you cannot enter in you cannot allow
36:53 -  your soul to be compromised by going along even though you're sitting in the front row and you're standing out conspicuously by your inability to enter in and everyone will notice still you have no alternative but to be that lonesome and offensive thing who just has not
37:08 -  the liberty to go along if there's something in in the depths of you and in the deeps where the issues of truth reality and righteousness are propounded that does not give you that liberty to make a concession there but merely for acceptance really not to be a strange
37:27 -  visage an uncomely sight is to lose your prophetic edge is to lose your credibility it's the first step in becoming false I don't know about this but if we go on in Jeremiah and Ezekiel God speaks of the false prophets as prophets
37:46 -  does it mean that at one time they were true and became false did they come full flesh false or was it a process of reduction by which their integrity was corroded compromises were affected they did not keep their prophetic heart with all diligence in that daily wrestling of the fighting
38:07 -  the good fight of faith and over a course of time found the whole prophetic call the whole prophetic call controverted and altered to the point where they had become false you have to keep your prophetic soul with diligence there needs to be such a jealousy
38:25 -  for the truth such an aliveness that any variation from it any deflection anything spoken sounded that seems to be but is not cannot go by you untested because every time we condescend to go along because of the pressure of our tears or the weight
38:47 -  of an occasion something takes place of a corrosive kind we lose something of the sharpness of our spirits there's a dullness that sets in when we give either our silence or spoken amen to that which is not real and that which is not true are you jealous for reality are you jealous
39:06 -  for the truth this is a prophetic distinctive but it's painful to maintain and costly and not that he's always right in it if the work of the cross is somewhere lacking and there's something subjective in him that is being touched and it's really not
39:25 -  God's heart that he's reflecting then what he's what he's moved about is something peevish rather than something spiritual something personal rather than God's very response to that thing and the prophet never knows whether he's right on with God or in any given moment can miss it
39:46 -  whether it's his subjectivity being expressed his own personal human dimension or God there's a continual tension between the possibility of missing it at any point in particular and how he reacts how he responds and what he says and yet for all that he's not allowed the luxury of
40:07 -  silence he's not he can't forfeit his obligation he's required even in that tension to speak and to express what he believes is the truth as he knows it in his inner man so the whole issue of inner man the whole issue of where is the locus of the way and event the point
40:29 -  from which you view reality is the critical point are you viewing externally visibly soulishly you're in your senses or are you viewing and and responding from the depths of your inner man where the reality of God is there's his spirit in your spirit are you trained in that
40:49 -  do you know the difference can you distinguish between your soul and your spirit how do you view how do you move how do you respond are you alive to the reality of what is in you by virtue of God over a course of time in a protracted and painful history by which something has been
41:09 -  established which is the reality that you're jealously maintaining and you can't allow it to be compromised that will make you strange and that will make you not one of the boys that goes along that will make you to react differently than others than others when everyone else seems to
41:29 -  be in agreement that something is being is particularly blessed and something in you is going off the other way that kind of thing needs to be jealously nurtured maintained and kept or you'll not have a basis for a prophetic sense of something out of which God can speak
41:51 -  i can give some examples one time in australia in a place where i was not a scheduled speaker the lord had me to attend and to be a share at this charismatic work and they were having one of the one of the great celebrations and i was sitting and was i was completely unmoved
42:12 -  completely untouched in my spirit everybody else was having what seems to be like a great time in the celebration of the lord but inside my spirit was unmoved because i could distinguish between what is in my inner man as against and as we were coming to the end and i soon to be called on the
42:32 -  lord froze the scene in a moment of time and i looked through the facade of seeming happiness and joy and festivity and celebration and what i saw was insecurity conflict doubt guilt you know that australia is a land of convicts and be underneath the facade of what was external
42:49 -  was the reality and the truth of their lives that was not overcoming that was not victorious but was only being superficially gilded with amens and hallelujahs and in that moment i'm hearing my name called to speak and i come up on the platform i have a choice you always have a
43:05 -  choice to speak the kind of thing that would be in in keeping with the kind of mood that has been established or speaking the strange and inward insight that you have received in a moment in God's froze time and of course the true prophetic man has no choice but to speak the truth thing it is
43:24 -  a moment of truth and so i described to this congregation i said as you were worshiping the lord froze the scene for me and i saw through the facade of your seeming celebration the actual truth of the condition of your life of insecurity fear faithlessness contradiction doubt
43:41 -  all these kinds of things and it was like a man throwing the brakes on and you could feel the whole room shuddering at the collision between what seems to be that has the universal approval of all in the congregation and what is being spoken by one solitary frail man on the platform
43:59 -  foolish weak an object of derision contemptible all those things is one against the many and they had a choice to make whether that one was speaking for God as God with God to the truth of their condition or the man is false and needs to be stoned but i praise God that the word of truth
44:20 -  went forth with such an unction that God anoints what he appoints that it went into the congregation and they broke in a moment of truth came one time once and for all and when it came they recognized it received the truth of it and broke over it and it set in motion the process of
44:40 -  repentance by which there could be and will be and probably has been a joyous celebration that will not be a fiction or a charade but the authentic reality that they reported to be having do you following what i'm saying how often do those moments of truth come to God's people
44:59 -  only so often as God has a man in that place who can sense that truth and communicate that truth over and against the objection of all who do not want to consider it because it's painful it's costly it means going back to the drawing board it means back to square one it means that everything
45:16 -  we have been about up till now is fraudulent make believe dubious false you can see how the fear of man will keep keep one from bringing that moment of truth to a congregation and if he's going to unmask the lie and blow the whistle on the things that are
45:37 -  fraudulent then he needs himself to be the authentic thing we can't bring people to a consideration of those things that are false to which we ourselves subscribe that's what one of the reasons why elijah and john the baptist were wilderness prophets they had to be out from the
45:56 -  institution the establishment the amenities the lifestyle the civilization to which they were God caustic voice and critic they could not share in those realities and yet be the voice that addresses them understand what i'm saying so how is there a way that that the prophetic man can be in the
46:15 -  world address the things that are threatening to the life of the church and its realities from the world and not himself be a partaker of that is part of the requirement and why the issue of wilderness is a significant factor in the shaping and the maintaining of such a man it's such a
46:37 -  separation the prophet is required to establish an alternative to what he's condemning that is powerful enough to displace the lie he presents a view of reality that is yet unknown to the congregation and yet he's got to project it in such a way not just to commend it but to make it
46:59 -  so feasible and so real as something to be sought and something to be sacrificed to obtain he presents a view of reality not yet known to the people but he presents it as a word but he presents it with with an authority that would commend it and require the congregation not only to seek it
47:19 -  but to forsake anything that is an alternative that is not real he brings a heavenly and an eternal sense that obliterates the kind of validation and endorsement that the world's values have had upon his hearers to that time if he had not come they would not have thought that
47:39 -  what they were celebrating was real when the prophet comes however he's not only blowing the whistle on what is false but he brings the sense of what is true and what is eternally true he brings the sense of eternity itself and inducts the hearers into it by his speaking he sets in
47:53 -  motion and brings his audience to a place where the false can become the true the word becomes creative and establishes something of an understanding that was not given before it pierces through the fault it raises another standard and makes that the foundation of life
48:12 -  and therefore it must be an extraordinary kind of speaking that's why the word has got to be an event something has got to be changed something has to be foundationally altered and the man that speaks it has got to somehow
48:31 -  speak it not just as a view but as something that is compounded out of the reality of his own life or will not have any cogency or any value he calls God's people to sacrifice because he raises the ultimate issues of the faith
48:57 -  particularly in the last days where they will not be fulfilled without the likelihood of great sacrifice opposition persecution oppression wanted them so what he brings is more than a word of explanation but he has to win his hearers to the willingness to make the sacrifice necessary to
49:17 -  fulfill the thing that has been put before them when we talk about jews in the last days and the holocaust that's coming and uprooting and jews fleeing through nations somehow they hear has got not only to be a prize of that scenario but enlisted in it to the point
49:33 -  where they would be willing to make those sacrifices of taking in a remnant of that people whatever the cost to themselves he not only presents the view he's got to obtain a kind of commitment that will affect that situation
49:49 -  which means a willingness for suffering raising up of the cross so there's so much
50:05 -  the prophet abhors likeness he respects and deeply guards the sanctity of language and its meaning he's concerned for words that become abused like the word prophet itself if that should become a cheapy if that should become a commonplace if that is a glib something that
50:25 -  does not represent what God intends and it becomes widely accepted and foundational we already on the in the movement towards the loss of the church as church so not the least of the prophetic functions is the jealous regard for language itself and its employment the key words speaking
50:46 -  i had to reprimand the brother this morning who is filling my ear with nice things at a time when i'm trying to find the mind of the world thinking that i was going to be cold on in the morning time and have to say then what you have a call you think you're going to be in God's service and you
51:02 -  don't know that there's a time for silence that you don't fill a man's ear with with trivia who's looking to the lord himself to bring the word you have not but i what i was wanting to communicate is you do not have a sufficient respect for words themselves that you're able
51:22 -  so readily to fill the air with your banter and with your conversation the prophetic man is much more jealous not only of speaking but also of silence he he knows that words will lose their currency if he is given to too much or too frequent speaking he's got to say less and say
51:43 -  it more forcefully when the time comes and stand God over any tendency to just talk if i get on the subject of false prophets i don't know if we'll let come tonight or tomorrow before we conclude we have to ask where does the prophet the prophetic man get
52:04 -  his message and his word God says you did not stand in my counsel that your word was one of your own imagining it was your own envisioning it was not my word and yet you ran with it and you spoke it and you and and expected that it would be fulfilled because you're not only a deceiver of
52:23 -  others you're deceived yourself you think that your word is my word and you've even prefaced it with thus saith the lord when i never said it and i never sent you how is it then that the that the false prophet did not receive a word from the lord because the only place in where it can be
52:42 -  received is in the council of God it's in the secret place it's in the holy place it's in the place of communion it's in the place of quiet it's in the place of separation where he has made time and room and allowance for that communication with God he's jealous over the issue of silence
53:01 -  over the issue of quiet over the issue of words over the issue of speaking and because of that he's more likely to find that of the disposition and time and place where God can communicate in the quiet the thing for which he should speak and when he does so he doesn't have to preface it with
53:21 -  a thus saith the lord the hearers will know that it's a word out of the heart of God from the council of God from the secret place from a man who has been there those who have always to say thus saith the lord thus saith the lord are likely to be speaking their own counsel their own wisdom their
53:38 -  own imagining their own envisioning because they have not been in the place where the holy word could have been communicated that means that the prophetic man has to be vigilant about silence about quiet about his own time with God and if a church is called to this it itself needs to come
54:01 -  into that respectful attitude time for celebration time for rejoicing time for worship time for quiet time for not staying up late unnecessarily with banter small talk and all the kinds of things that we like in the kind of a freshly socializing but an earlier to bed earlier to rise up with john
54:19 -  westley at 4 a.m while it's yet dark and and the light has not yet broken and to seek God in the in the quiet place before the rest of the world wakes is the place where God's counsel is most likely to be given i want to pray for such a church
54:41 -  because i can't i have not seen the time when the issue of true propheticness is more cogent than now and the fourth thing is so everywhere about us and so beguiling and so attractive so lord
55:01 -  grant a willingness for the kind of training and preparation of the man and of the church that is required to be the thing in itself not only what
55:19 -  it says but what it demonstrates not only what it proclaims but what it shows forth the reality of the reality of God as God the sacred task of sharing your divine view your perspective of things as you see them painful things that from which we would shrink we don't want to consider
55:41 -  them in a way that must come to the consideration of the church if it's to fulfill its own prophetic call so grant us a heart for this grant us a respect for this grant us a willingness for such a preparation we invite you lord to deal with those soft
56:02 -  places in our own being that are too concerned for how we are viewed by men how we will be appreciated how we will be regarded for how shall we speak the hard things my God if we are compromised by that concern so we ask you to raise up the cross the suffering that necessarily
56:24 -  is part and parcel of the shaping of a prophetic people and the willingness my God to be dealt with grant us histories of dealings your dealings with us the secret things that are unseen unknown by others the kinds of episodes and events that come out of a life of obedience that can't be anticipated
56:46 -  that will be horrendous humiliating that we have to bear as pain and out of which comes a residue of the knowledge of view an exquisite knowledge that is not given in any other place it's the fellowship of your suffering and grant lord a willingness in your people to bear it
57:13 -  restore the great world war to us that the church has at its foundations the apostles and the prophets as the holy prophets of old so the holy prophets of our own generation and the last generation a respect my God for this precious
57:32 -  and foundational calling our willingness ourselves to be it if that is our call personally and certainly to be it as it is our call corporately as the church in the world seeing and communicating to its own nation and civilization and culture an understanding of its own history its own events
57:53 -  as God would have it to be understood who is soon coming in judgment to judge the world for its long-standing blasphemy and rejection of a God that it has not deeply considered raise up a prophetic church lord that calls even the nation to an awareness of that God
58:14 -  before that judgment comes and we bless you and thank you for the privilege of it in Jesus name and then now i can go on with false prophets or do you want to take a break here
58:44 -  so praise the lord that was good i mean that's so weak to say that was good but that was good please for me i really felt um speaking to my heart specific things
59:09 -  and we want to um come here to take an offering for for our um he lives up in minnesota in a community they live by faith in the whole community um you're you're not breeding pigs anymore anything filling them are you
59:28 -  but uh i i just um i think it's important for each one of us as we respond to the word if God has spoken to our heart that we would have an opportunity at least for a response financially to make up to make that response the scripture says that we sow spiritual things and
59:49 -  meet physical things excuse me and i just really i feel like it's important for all of us to be able to make a response specifically to this word
01:00:06 -  this money will all go to art depends your ministry make the text out to uh river of life um you got envelopes there's envelopes and uh if you if you need an envelope i just want to pray the lord just speak to each of you what he would have you to do as we respond
01:00:25 -  to this word and i'm grateful i'm grateful for this word i really do believe it's another word for the body of christ and uh personally i don't know anybody else who can really share it other than art and uh i believe it's a word we're going to hear more and more it's not going to be a
01:00:43 -  a word that's very well appreciated by a lot of people no thanks but that's okay and those of you who are here we hear what the spirit is saying to the church in this hour so let's pray father we just ask that you seal that word in our heart
01:01:01 -  for those who'd be wrestling with things that were said lord that you help them to wrestle through to your end lord we ask now that you would speak to our hearts how you would have us to respond in a financial way to our brother who travels the world literally by faith lives in a community by
01:01:22 -  faith has come down here with no expectation participation for any finances and lord i know many times after he gets them speaking they probably give them less in some places that he goes or not giving anything at all
01:01:40 -  sad state of our church lord but here we are this season in this hour more than an opportunity to so into ministry into a life lord that has been laid down at the altar for your purposes lord lord we know there's 30-fold ground 50-fold ground 100-fold ground
01:02:06 -  ground lord i know this is 100-fold ground thank you lord for a person that has the tenacity to be able to go to Israel speak a word that's not accepted by most of your people and yet it goes forth as a word of the lord
01:02:27 -  lord we know looking through the old testament that that happened again and again and again we we applaud and celebrate jeremiah ezekiel but lord in their time period lord they weren't celebrated lord we just like the word says we decorate the tombs of the prophets and yet we
01:02:47 -  are the ones who killed them help us lord to have that discerning ear to hear what the spirit would say to the church in this hour and lord may our financial response right now even be a statement to that end that we desire to be a people individuals and corporately to hear what the
01:03:11 -  spirit is saying to the church we thank you for that lord bless this offering bless those that are giving bless the word the seeds that have gone into our heart lord that they might bear fruit and that that fruit might remain in Jesus name and then you guys go ahead and pass that
