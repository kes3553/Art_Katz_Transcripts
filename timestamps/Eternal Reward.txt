Eternal Reward

00:00 -  So it seems clear that the Church is in the earth while Israel is going through its time of final tribulation. And the faithful Church shares in the tribulation of Israel. But obtains an eternal reward.
00:34 -  That raises the question about the Church's rapture, which we have traditionally thought meant before such a time of tribulation. I'm not a great authority on this subject,
01:02 -  but it seems clear in all of the texts that we have shared. Ezekiel 37, chapter 20 of Ezekiel, Amos 9, and in many other places. There is a people in the earth who are a key to the surviving of Israel's remnant.
01:47 -  Ezekiel 37 is especially significant because there it shows that God is as concerned with the Son of Man as He is with the dry bones. Can these bones live?
02:18 -  It's a question that the prophet himself cannot answer. Lord, you know, this is beyond his prophetic faith. Maybe even beyond his desire.
02:38 -  And yet, except that he speaks the word to Israel, except that he prophesies, those bones cannot live.
02:56 -  God brings a supreme and final ultimate challenge to the Son of Man himself, which I believe is a picture of the Church of the last days. Because except that we can rise to this,
03:24 -  how should we rule and reign with Christ? It is only those that are priests and blessed and holy that reign with Him. The very same qualifications that blesses the remnant of Israel in the last days.
03:57 -  Can you see the mystery? Would the Church have risen to this prophetic stature without this challenge? It's the crisis of Israel that compels the Church to be the Church,
04:22 -  speaking with one voice, in total agreement, in the faith of the Son of Man himself, and a faith that can only work by love,
04:41 -  or it will not work at all. How many of us are in that condition now? Very few, if any.
04:59 -  What will it take to bring us to that place, from where we presently are? That we might be of one heart and one mind,
05:20 -  and speak that one word when it's commanded, that brings Israel from its grave. For Paul says in Romans 11,
05:34 -  what will their return be, but life from the dead? Do you have any idea what goes into the making of a prophet?
05:52 -  Do you have any idea of what goes into the making of a prophet? Dealings and sufferings of a particular kind. God does not trust his words to any mouth.
06:23 -  In Ezekiel 37 he says, and you will know that I am the Lord, speaking to Israel. Let me read it.
06:40 -  In Ezekiel 37, verse 14. And you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord.
07:00 -  And verse 14, the last part of it. Verse 13, you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves.
07:08 -  See that? Read that. Verse 13 of Ezekiel 37.
07:16 -  But when he was in the gates of Benjamin, you were there, the head of the guards. And you will know that I, the Lord,
07:30 -  when I have opened your graves, and will bring you out of your graves, verse 14, I shall put my spirit in you,
07:37 -  you shall live. I shall place you in your own land. And then shall you know that I, the Lord,
07:47 -  have spoken it, and performed it. Now how can God say that?
07:56 -  It's the son of man who has spoken it. God commanded him to prophesy to those boys. And yet God says,
08:08 -  and you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it. What can we consider about this? That God makes no distinction
08:19 -  between the speaking of the prophet and his own speaking. The prophet's voice is his voice.
08:33 -  The mind of the Lord is the prophet's mind. The prophet has come to such an ultimate place in the knowledge of God
08:49 -  that you cannot distinguish the one from the other. God has two purposes. Israel's restoration
09:00 -  and the church's transfiguration. The last only comes through the crisis that Israel presents to the church.
09:20 -  Have you the faith to believe for this? That these bones can live? Easy to nod your head.
09:30 -  It's easy. When have you picked up a dry bone last? It turns apart in your hands.
09:41 -  It turns to powder in your hands. There's nothing more dead than dry bones. It makes the faith go out of you.
09:59 -  You can believe that those bones can live with the word that comes out of your mouth. You have the faith for that?
10:12 -  That's ultimate faith. And you desire to see those bones live? Won't that threaten you?
10:25 -  Do you want Israel to be restored? Don't you want to be the only one that basks in the light of God?
10:36 -  You want the younger son to come back? What do you call it? The son who lost all of his fortune?
10:43 -  The prodigal son? You want that son to come back? And to share with him in God's glory?
10:55 -  And you have a faith that works by love? We're not talking about sentiment. At a time when these people will be hated in all nations?
11:12 -  You're going to love them? It's got to be the love of God. It's got to be the faith of God.
11:23 -  That's why he says, I have spoken and performed it. For what does Paul say? For of him
11:36 -  and through him and to him are all things
11:44 -  to whom be glory forever. Your present ministry now, your Christian life now,
11:57 -  is it through him or through you? Your well-meaning intention,
12:07 -  your ability, your cleverness. That's all very good,
12:16 -  but it's not glorious. Do you know what it means to live through him? And to serve in the power of his life
12:34 -  and to have his thoughts and to speak his words and to seek his pleasure?
12:45 -  It's the cross. It's a dying to everything that's convenient
12:54 -  and to what men want from you and expect from you. Today is the Sabbath.
13:06 -  God wants to restore it for his believing people. For them to have rest
13:16 -  when we cease from our own labors, when we cease, we stop from our own labors and no longer speak our own words,
13:29 -  no seek our own pleasure, but his. How does one live like that?
13:38 -  What would we do? What do we speak? Can we trust his resurrection life?
13:45 -  And what if he's not speaking? Won't we look foolish? Oh, I'm touching something so deep now
14:01 -  that most of present Christianity will miss. Who will approve of the doctrine of the resurrection? Approve of the doctrine
14:27 -  but not be living in its life? Where are you now? What's the basis of your present Christianity?
14:42 -  Are you willing to move from one to the other and pass through a no man's land? Do you understand this expression?
14:56 -  A no man's land. What happens when you pull the plug out of the electrical appliance
15:10 -  and there's no power? And it's dead. And what happens then?
15:19 -  Isn't it embarrassing? What do you say and do? What do you say and do?
15:28 -  If there's no other alternative, like the life of Christ, the newness of life,
15:40 -  which broke the feathers of death. Paul says we are dead and hid with Christ in God until his life is revealed.
16:02 -  Then is our life revealed also unto glory. Do you believe that?
16:12 -  Would you live like that? At the University of Kiev where you have to speak to the students
16:23 -  in an open gospel demonstration on campus where you will not trust your own cleverness and trust in the power of his life
16:46 -  that reveals his words? This is more the picture of our last day's experience. And it is on this basis that I've been sharing with you.
17:09 -  I did not come with a program and outline of what to say. Trusting his life
17:22 -  and the wisdom of it, ceasing from my own works that he might perform his.
17:34 -  You say, well, brother, these are just classes. It's not all that important. You're clever enough, you could have gotten by.
17:49 -  But you don't understand. This is more than a class. This is an eternal moment that has come
18:02 -  of an historic kind that may not come again. And who is sufficient for these things?
18:20 -  You're going to be required to operate in this faith and trust in this life and learn it the hard and painful way
18:36 -  where God will test you and his life will not always be revealed in the form and the expression that you would like
18:53 -  that would have made you successful or saved you from the disappointment of failure. He will test to see how jealous you are for his glory.
19:10 -  For his glory is always related to his resurrection and not to our well-meaning Christian intention. I could tell you such stories
19:30 -  of how I have been tested not at the University of Kiev, but Harvard University,
19:42 -  Yale University, TÃ¼bingen University in Germany, where I went in for a cup of coffee
19:52 -  after several days of meetings. And the leader of the communist student group met me there.
20:06 -  He said, you're the most dangerous man that has ever come to this campus. It was not a tribute to my cleverness.
20:19 -  But the life of Christ who is bringing his own words with a power that arrested men
20:31 -  and stopped them in their tracks. Israel must be resurrected again. But only through a church that is itself
20:46 -  a resurrection people. We cannot test that in a final moment. It begins now.
21:01 -  And all of our moments must prepare us for that final moment. Everything is of him and for us.
21:14 -  That it might be to him as glory forever. It will require our death from trusting our own ability.
21:29 -  We will disappoint men. We will disappoint ourselves. We will not always like what comes out from us.
21:44 -  It's a humiliation and a dying. You can never know what the end of it will be. Are you willing for that?
21:59 -  It's the issue of his glory forever. And Israel's salvation.
