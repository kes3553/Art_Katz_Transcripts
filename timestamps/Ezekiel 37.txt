Ezekiel 37

00:00 -  I think that's an appropriate name change all the more as my topic tonight is Israel. And not to be something spoken from the point of view of vested interest being Jewish or to appeal to your sentimental interest or to the mystique of Israel
00:20 -  or your sense of guilt or obligation for what we owe to this people who have given us the Bible, the apostles and all of that, but a totally different perspective which for the want of a better word I'd like to call an apostolic perception of the issue of Israel
00:37 -  and one that I can freely commend to you if indeed we have serious intention of being an apostolic and prophetic body which is to say to be true church. There's something that needs to be fitted into our end time perception
00:57 -  and it is the issue of Israel so central in my opinion to the final and consummating purposes of God that profoundly involve the church. How's that for an opening statement?
01:11 -  Having said that, I'm going to sit down. Having said that, hopefully to intrigue you and to open your heart and understanding for which we have been praying today
01:22 -  because this is so enormously important that the issue of the Jew and the issue of Israel is in fact at the end of the age as it has been in my opinion throughout the ages, the issue of the church
01:34 -  that God has locked these two entities in to a reciprocal relationship that the one without the other cannot come to its fulfillment in the purposes of God. I'm just throwing these statements out.
01:50 -  I don't expect that you will be able to say amen at this point but just to make statements and that perhaps by the end of the message and after you've reflected upon it, you will then be able to give a hearty yay and amen.
02:04 -  Let's look at Ezekiel chapter 37 as the basic text of tonight though I hope to turn to some other scriptures as well.
02:18 -  The Valley of Dry Bones familiar to most of us and then we'll pray. The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord
02:30 -  and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold, there were very many in the open valley and lo, they were very dry
02:41 -  and he said unto me, son of man, can these bones live? and I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest and again he said to me, prophesy upon these bones and say unto them,
02:51 -  O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold, I will cause wrath to empty into you and you shall live
02:59 -  and I will lay sinners upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord
03:08 -  so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to bone
03:16 -  and when I beheld low the sinners and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me, prophesy unto the wind
03:26 -  prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, thus saith the Lord God come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them
03:37 -  and they lived and stood up upon their feet and exceedingly great army and then he said unto me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel behold, they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost
03:50 -  and we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them, thus saith the Lord God, behold all my people I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves
04:00 -  and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves all my people and brought you up out of your graves
04:08 -  and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it, saith the Lord
04:21 -  so precious God, we ask a grace of interpretation by the Holy Spirit your rendering for us whom you have collected, gathered tonight grant us some sense of what this means in your own sight
04:39 -  use it to awaken us and bring us from our grave of indifference and ignorance even hostility against Israel bring us to life, my God, in something that is dear in your own sight
04:55 -  and that should rightly affect every aspect of our faith help us to be the instruments of your use, my God, in the effecting of this that you might be glorified thereby
05:07 -  come and give us the breath of life in the speaking, hearing and responding that we might see, my God, this chapter fulfilled in your time to your eternal praise and glory, in Jesus name we pray, amen
05:23 -  so two requests, first to borrow some water from my dear interpreting brother down here my topic tonight is to interpret Israel's present calamity one that we have not only been aware of, but one that has caused us
05:40 -  who have been supporters of Israel's present calamity to interpret Israel's present calamity to interpret Israel's present calamity
05:55 -  who have been supporters of Israel, no little dismay and concern Israel's conduct has been a disappointment not only to us who have hoped that we would see a nation of a unique kind
06:11 -  in the fulfillment of the prophetic word but has been a disappointment to themselves it has disappointed Jewry the world over
06:21 -  and we are only at the beginning of what shall begin in disappointment and end in a much deeper but unnecessary mortification and all of this is not mere happenstance
06:35 -  I believe it is the very hand of God and necessary for the ultimate and the true fulfillment of God's intention through a restored or shall I say a resurrected Israel
06:48 -  how quick we were to applaud this present Israel and how disappointed we were that by its 40th anniversary when one could have hoped that we would have seen the fulfillment of things hoped for
07:02 -  that indeed these calamities were already beginning to unfold things that could not have been anticipated that brought Israel to such a place of confrontation and distress
07:14 -  that in the necessity to defend itself or even to perpetuate itself its existence it found itself increasingly required to act in a ways that were distinctly un-Jewish and if we have celebrated anything as Jews historically
07:30 -  and probably would have continued the luxury of that celebration it was the sense that we had something unique going for us of a moral and ethical kind
07:44 -  it's the kind of thing one enjoys when one is not really tested but when the test came we found ourselves horrifyingly capable of a conduct that we ourselves would have condemned
07:58 -  and have condemned when we ourselves were the object of that conduct as for example when it was perpetrated upon us by our enemies and more recently by Germany in that Nazi period
08:11 -  we're acting now ironically in a way that is too fearfully close to what we ourselves experienced and it's a predicament and a crisis, a moral one
08:25 -  of which I believe God himself is the author Now, is that to say then that this is a final demonstration and proof that God has finished with Israel
08:38 -  and that Israel is showing its true colors and is not what it hoped to be as a demonstration of a Jewish nation in a Gentile world and what we evangelicals had hoped for it to be
08:48 -  and therefore it's the final and concluding proof what some critics have all along contended in an issue that has been raised from the church through the time of Paul
08:57 -  Is God finished with Israel? Is this the conclusive evidence? And the answer is of course God forbid no that Israel does have a destiny
09:10 -  but it is not to be revealed in its own achievement but lies exclusively in God's faithfulness to his own election and promise by his own power
09:26 -  that if we could but understand Israel in its failure to be the nation that it hoped in a generation what a colossal success that would have been
09:37 -  in 40 years to resuscitate a dead language to establish a whole civilization to become one of the formidable military and technological powers in the world
09:48 -  despite the sparsity of its numbers and came within a head's breadth of succeeding and had it succeeded what would have been celebrated?
09:59 -  Not God but the ability of this most unique people which was never God's intention the whole purpose of Israel as a witness nation
10:11 -  is not to celebrate itself but it's God and therefore he could not allow it to succeed on the basis of its own prowess or expertise
10:21 -  but allow it to come teasingly close to that kind of fulfillment only to have the bottom abruptly fall out through calamities of such a kind as no one could have imagined
10:36 -  so the fulfillment of God's intention for Israel waits not upon its demonstration of its virtue but the final exhaustion of any capability
10:48 -  it might have had in itself humanly speaking to be the Israel of God Israel's failure to establish herself as a righteous state
11:00 -  and as an example to the Gentile nations is her very witness to this fact of course she doesn't understand
11:12 -  she doesn't have our privilege of the illumination of the spirit and being the kind of secular and non-biblical people
11:21 -  that she essentially is except for a small minority does not take Ezekiel 37 seriously and has not seen her present plight in the light
11:30 -  of the prophetic scriptures that's a real irony and a truer statement of its real condition as a nation
11:37 -  utterly secular and seeking by its own prowess and ability to extricate itself from its own predicaments
11:46 -  and will not succeed we who love Israel need to brace ourselves and anticipate an increasingly deepening crisis
11:59 -  unto death and I don't know how literal that death will be but I believe that Ezekiel 37
12:13 -  is something that points to and makes clear the necessity for that kind of death that he might raise them up out of their grave
12:23 -  that they might know that I am the Lord that is reiterated in this text in verses 6 and you shall know that I am the Lord
12:35 -  in verse 13 and you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves for my people and brought you up out of your graves
12:41 -  and verse 14 and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land
12:46 -  then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord to know the I am and to know the Lord
12:54 -  is to know a God who performs something because he has spoken it that what takes place is not the result of your endeavor
13:02 -  and your ability but the power of a God to fulfill his own word in the very face of your utter and dismal failure
13:16 -  and if we don't know God that way we don't know God for he is a God of resurrection from the dead preeminently that's the way Abraham had to know him
13:26 -  in order to become the father of many nations it's the way in which the church is required to know him or we do not know him at all
13:36 -  and if we do not know him and Israel does not know him how shall he be made known as he in fact is so you who have clucked your tongues
13:46 -  only to happy to see the disintegration of the hope of Israel or those of us who have waxed melancholy and unhappy at the sight of their vexation
14:00 -  and crisis that requires them to display force in a way that is characteristically un-Jewish and contradicts the very aspiration of Israel to be
14:08 -  a moral example to the nations need to understand the deeper significance of this crisis again of which God is the author
14:18 -  our very failure as the church to understand it by clucking our tongues or wringing our fingers shows that we have not truly understood God
14:28 -  that the hope to see the fulfillment of Israel in 40 years as the prophetic messianic state is really an expression of our own impatience
14:43 -  our own immaturity and our own lack of understanding of the centrality of the cross and of suffering in the effecting of the things that are enduring and eternal
14:58 -  in a word what we wanted charismatically for them was what we want for ourselves, a quick fix and the same people who thought that the charismatic movement
15:09 -  was the spirit being poured out on all flesh and thought that we had arrived are equally the candidates to believe
15:16 -  that this Zionistic state largely the work of man was itself the fulfillment of the prophetic scriptures that's not to say that there's not to be such a fulfillment
15:30 -  but it's a process much more painful much more excruciating, much more demanding much more requiring the supernatural demonstration of God
15:44 -  than we had understood then you shall know when I the Lord have spoken it and performed it
15:52 -  saith the Lord and I shall place you in your own land I have a growing suspicion
15:58 -  that my own people have placed themselves and if anyone is capable of that it is we through our own funding
16:06 -  through our own strengths and energies and ability that's not to say that God was not present and even giving an assist
16:13 -  but it was an assist in order to bring us to a final demonstration of our own ultimate incapacity to establish our own state that must be demonstrated
16:27 -  if the Israel of God is to be established by the power of God in the knowledge of God that he might be made known to the nations
16:36 -  in the fulfillment of their calling spoken of in Romans 11 that is without repentance namely to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world
16:46 -  a Zionistic Israel that would have succeeded on the basis of its own merit and its own strength could not have been that light
16:55 -  but that it was necessary for them to experience that failure that out of the ashes of that death might come the resurrection of the true messianic Israel by the power of God
17:07 -  was a necessary prelude in my opinion because Israel is his witness people all the more in their apostasy and undeservedness
17:24 -  that it might demonstrate to the nations that I am is who I am and when he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy
17:34 -  he will have mercy independent of the stinking track record and failure and apostasy of that people in their undeservedness
17:43 -  can you understand what I'm saying folks? this is not an anti-Semitic diatribe this is an understanding that to be the true witness nation
17:53 -  is to display God in his essential character which is his mercy and that his mercy can only be mercy
18:02 -  when it is extended in total undeservedness to a nation that has blasphemed him in every place where they have been driven
18:11 -  and even now in their conduct required in their own perpetuation does not honor God
18:22 -  and that God will bring mercy to that people and bring it in such a way that it is recognized by all nations that not only will Israel recognize
18:30 -  that I the Lord have spoken this and have performed it but the nations themselves so spectacular, so powerful, and so supernatural
18:39 -  will be the God who establishes Israel in the land when he will do it according to the word that he has spoken
18:54 -  so the issue is not the glorification of Israel but of God a God who through his own goodness
19:00 -  prompts him to act as he does and as the recipients of his undeserved grace and mercy they become most profoundly the witness unto him
19:11 -  and if anybody has his head screwed on right tonight and is hearing this can say you know Art you might as well be describing the church
19:18 -  exactly if we are not the witness of undeserved mercy what are we witnessing?
19:25 -  and in fact it's the failure to deeply comprehend that that incapacitates us to play the role that God has designated for us
19:33 -  in bringing Israel from its grave namely that by our mercy they might receive mercy I want to say tonight that I have very little confidence
19:42 -  that in our present condition as the church at large that we have such a handle on the mercy of God that we are so conscious of being the recipients of his mercy
19:50 -  that we are in any condition to extend it but I want to say that the time is not far when we're going to come to an historic moment
20:00 -  that if we don't know that mercy as we should and are not able to demonstrate it to this people it will be a colossal failure of a schema
20:08 -  that God himself has established by which is to be glorified through Israel in its through the church
20:18 -  in its extending of mercy to Israel that it might be restored I think we're going to see death
20:28 -  in such a form not only to those that are in present Israel but to a Jewry throughout the world
20:36 -  that a increasing global fury of anti-Semitism will come of such a kind that Jews will be driven out of their places of affluence
20:46 -  and security and safety to find themselves again refugees in the world whether there will be such a death in Israel itself
20:54 -  of a military kind and a conflict with its militant Arab enemies of the kind that despite their proud boast
21:01 -  never again they shall find themselves driven again out of the land and into the nations I can't say
21:06 -  but I'm preparing myself for that eventuality whether it's that or not I expect a calamity of increasing proportion
21:13 -  to come upon this people to bring them to a place where as this text says they themselves say we are cut off
21:21 -  we are dry bones we are without hope and I ask any of you in this audience tonight
21:27 -  who have any knowledge of Jewish history or of my people presently if you can tell me a moment when
21:34 -  we have ever nationally acknowledged that we are without hope if anything we are the perennial optimists
21:43 -  not in God but in ourselves and that we can come out of the Holocaust with a tattooed number on our arm
21:50 -  and a shredded shirt and nothing more and within a matter of a decade or two establish our fortunes in such a way
21:56 -  as to make the Gentiles envious who are around about us what will it take to bring us to a place
22:07 -  where we ourselves acknowledge that we are cut off and that we are without hope
22:13 -  and that we are as dry bones because God is waiting for that acknowledgement and when he comes he commands the prophet to speak
22:22 -  that their graves might be open that they might come out of their graves and become an exceeding great army
22:33 -  so the church which should have known better would be less critical of Israel if it understood about itself
22:39 -  that God does not receive us for any worthiness on our own part how much of our disappointment with Israel
22:45 -  is predicated on a false premise and hope of an idealized Israel that we have been fascinated by
22:52 -  by the energy of this people and their ability to raise themselves up in a generation
22:58 -  which is really a statement of the projection of our own vain hopes
23:04 -  and perception of ourselves contrary to the whole tenor of the gospel
23:10 -  that rests on the issue of death and resurrection necessary for Abraham
23:16 -  necessary for Jesus but somehow not necessary for Israel to raise ourselves
23:22 -  that the thing that endures exceedingly and eternally is what is raised up out of death
23:28 -  by the power of God and that there's something about death that even we
23:34 -  who celebrate the doctrine of resurrection don't want ourselves to taste in our own experience
23:40 -  and therefore did not desire it for Israel either we wanted a glibber, easier
23:46 -  more facile success but God is not accommodating our shallowness he must perform
23:52 -  what he must perform that he might be glorified thereby for nothing demonstrates
23:58 -  the glory of God more than to take something that is abjectly and totally failed
24:04 -  unto death and to resurrect and to raise that to a newness of life
24:10 -  not the Israeli that is marked by its chutzpah its arrogance and self assurance
24:16 -  which would have impressed many of us and has but a newness of life
24:22 -  that displays the very character of God in the humility and brokenness out of which God will raise this people
24:28 -  in the profoundest repentance that has ever come to any nation on earth consider for example
24:42 -  in Ezekiel where it says that when they see him that they shall mourn they shall be in bitterness for him
24:48 -  as one is in bitterness for whence first born every family apart
24:54 -  it's just a faint stroke of God's brush but it suggests a national
25:00 -  repentance of such a kind that has never been demonstrated by any nation on earth
25:08 -  in Ezekiel 36 verse 31
25:30 -  Zephaniah chapter 3 I will also leave in verse 12
25:56 -  this nation's character is going to be so transformed by the remarkable dealings of God
26:02 -  that brings them to a death of their own celebration and raises them up
26:08 -  to a new character of life that the nations themselves will rejoice for the blessedness that comes to them
26:16 -  through so transformed a people at that time I will bring you again in verse 20 even in the time that I gather you
26:26 -  for I will make you a name and a praise among all the people of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes
26:32 -  saith the Lord verse before it verse 21
26:44 -  thy people also shall be righteous it says in Isaiah 60 verse 21 they shall inherit the land forever
26:50 -  the branch of my planting, the work of my hands that I may be glorified a little one shall become as a thousand
26:58 -  and a small one a strong nation I the Lord will hasten it in its time whereas thou hast been forsaken
27:04 -  in verse 15 of that chapter so that no man went through thee I will make thee an eternal
27:10 -  excellency, a joy of many generations and we can see that scenario
27:16 -  being played out now the increasing distaste of nations for Israel
27:22 -  those who formally honored Israel, those who put the stickers on their bumpers
27:28 -  for Israel and then took them off at the first oil crisis that something is happening
27:34 -  that Israel that was once celebrated as a David among Goliaths is increasingly losing its
27:40 -  favor among nations and a growing distemper of agitation and
27:46 -  disquiet toward Israel to the point where a hatred will be developed
27:52 -  in an Israel that will not hesitate to use any means for its own perpetuation to the moral dismay of
27:58 -  nations who expected better of her this is in fulfillment of the scripture
28:04 -  the pity would be that we should find ourselves among those who hate her in our disappointment in her failure
28:10 -  when we should have understood that that very failure was needful and was
28:16 -  forthspoken by God and needs be fulfilled now
28:34 -  it's interesting that God himself does not speak to the dry bones but he employs
28:40 -  a prophet and commands him to speak a prophet whose very prophetic faith
28:46 -  is stretched to the uttermost nigh unto breaking when God himself brings him by the spirit
28:52 -  down into the valley of dry bones and makes him walk all around and in a sense rubs his face into the
28:58 -  fact of the utter totality of this death unto dry bones
29:04 -  bereft of any hope and then puts the teasing question to him can these bones live?
29:12 -  if a prophet is known for anything it's prophetic faith it's prophetic confidence
29:18 -  prophetic knowledge of God and yet it's an extremity of such a kind that stretches even
29:24 -  the prophet to the breaking that he can only answer haltingly Lord thou knowest
29:32 -  I'll tell you that if his faith faulted that he employs a prophet and calls him the son of man
29:40 -  isn't that what prophet is? aren't you looking at one, hearing one who is utterly man, who sweats at the pores
29:46 -  who quakes who goes through all of the conniptions that here in the flesh
29:54 -  like any man he is ultimately man in all defect and failure and yet called
30:00 -  chosen to see to proclaim the foolish things and to be half jokingly
30:06 -  instructed by the pastor before coming out on the platform I hope you're not going to cause a debacle of such a kind that I'll not be able
30:12 -  to clean up afterwards there's something about the prophetic calling that's I don't know, I don't have a word for it
30:22 -  it's a mess and it's a glory son of man
30:28 -  they're not little robots punched off the assembly line they're flesh and blood and have a history in God
30:36 -  and must experience the very things that they're required to speak can these bones live?
30:42 -  son of man why is God so graphic why are these statements
30:48 -  so penetrating I believe that God is suggesting
30:54 -  that there must come a time at the consummation at the age in these last days
31:00 -  where if Israel is to be restored because what shall her restoration be but life from the dead
31:20 -  now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles
31:26 -  how much more their fullness for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world
31:32 -  what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead verses 12 and 15
31:38 -  of Romans 11 and where did Paul get it from the same texts
31:44 -  that we are considering tonight as I shared with your pastor as I shared with your pastor earlier today
31:50 -  we've been on this subject through the day it's an astonishment how prolific the prophetic scriptures are
31:56 -  about the restoration of Israel as a nation in the great redemptive purposes
32:02 -  of God and yet how little conviction and understanding there is among God's people
32:08 -  how little anticipation which is all the more embarrassing as I believe that the church is destined by God
32:14 -  and has a mandate by God to be the very factor that brings Israel's restoration
32:20 -  to pass that by our mercy they might receive mercy have they stumbled at the age of fall
32:26 -  Paul asks in this chapter God forbid, but through their fall salvation has come to the gentiles
32:32 -  so as to move them to jealousy when the fullness of the gentiles be come in
32:38 -  then all Israel shall be saved as it is written
32:44 -  if you look in this great concluding epical chapter of Romans 9-11
32:50 -  God's centerpiece in the book of Romans which is Paul's definitive theological
32:56 -  and apostolic statement of the grand plan of God is the issue of Israel inserted
33:02 -  and I want to ask the church tonight is it inserted centrally in our understanding
33:08 -  and if it's not to what degree are we apostolic what shall the receiving of them be
33:16 -  but life from the dead we can't begin to understand the impact
33:22 -  that Israel's restoration will have for the nations of the earth it will be the most glorious
33:28 -  and global demonstration of God in his mercy that has ever been visibly
33:34 -  expressed before the nations of the world and this Israel that is presently
33:40 -  a threat to its neighbors and is a word of foreboding and dread by nations round about
33:46 -  and even threatens the security of nations of the world that are distant from it will be
33:52 -  such a blessing as God spoke to Abraham as to bless all
33:58 -  the families of the earth a resurrected people coming in the meekness of the very nature
34:04 -  of God himself who are formally known for their belligerence and their arrogance and their military might
34:10 -  to come to the very nations whom they threatened and at the risk of their own life
34:16 -  to make the mercy of God known the nations that would otherwise have perished
34:22 -  it will be as life from the dead I personally do not believe that it's the task of the church
34:28 -  to evangelize the nations it is to win from the nations a people for his name
34:36 -  from among all nations but the task of the nations themselves I believe as Israel's
34:42 -  as the first of restored nations to the nations that makes its ministry
34:48 -  a life from the dead and yet how shall it be restored to fulfill it
34:54 -  if we fail in our function to be to it what God calls us to be in the extending of our mercy
35:00 -  and of the making of them jealous though Paul says in the same book
35:06 -  that they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake what will it take
35:12 -  and what kind of a church will it require to move this Israel to jealousy that has historically
35:18 -  opposed the gospel to the point where Paul does not hesitate to call them the enemy of the gospel
35:24 -  whatever it is I cannot describe it but I'll say this it is more than that which we have known and what is charismatic
35:30 -  at its best only an ultimate church its apostolic and prophetic configuration
35:36 -  in its maturity in its coherence in its true
35:42 -  corpority, in its true nature and intention of God revealing his light and his glory
35:48 -  can conceivably fulfill this mandate now listen to this the question is
35:56 -  will we be that church ever if we do not take that mandate seriously
36:02 -  I want to say tonight that God has given us that mandate
36:08 -  not so much only for Israel's sake but as much for our own if we did not have
36:14 -  this stubborn, obdurate and resistant people as the ultimate target of our
36:20 -  outreach and the demonstration of the reality of our God we would have satisfied ourselves
36:26 -  with much less standard and much less requirement we would have measured by ourselves
36:32 -  and unto ourselves, did you like the meeting? how's the Sunday school? how's the program for the kids? did you enjoy the preaching?
36:38 -  how is the worship? how's the budget? all of these measures have
36:44 -  infinitely to do with ourselves but God gives us happily a measure
36:50 -  that requires us to some transcendent place beyond and outside of ourselves
36:56 -  and not just any people but this people who have historically been the most obdurate
37:02 -  resistors of the gospel in all of their intellectuality in all of their stubborn character
37:08 -  in all of their ability, they are fearful in their resistance and he says, now move that people to jealousy
37:16 -  we heard prophetically tonight in the earlier part of the service that there's a grace that is available
37:22 -  and a great grace that has not yet been given to the church because we have not yet taken this mandate
37:28 -  seriously it has been to the detriment of the Jew and it has been to the detriment of the
37:34 -  church that we have sidestepped this most demanding of all
37:40 -  gospel requirements that God even gives as a first priority that this gospel is the power of God
37:46 -  unto salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek
37:52 -  I can't say it as a thus I can only say it as an intuitive prophetic conviction
37:58 -  that I believe that that is an requirement of the church
38:04 -  in every generation and in every locality and which church at any time
38:10 -  historically and presently could ever say but there are no Jews round about to whom we can go first
38:16 -  as in God and his genius who has given the mandate also given us the potential for its fulfillment
38:22 -  by seeing to it in this multiple way that in judging Israel and casting it out among all nations
38:28 -  that there's not a nation in which the church is where Jews are not why have we failed to honor
38:36 -  the priority of God why have we failed to take the word of God seriously
38:42 -  because intuitively I think that we're cowards because intuitively I think that we recognize
38:48 -  this is too formidable and too demanding for us and indeed it is and indeed it is
38:54 -  as God is waiting for a witness nation as God is waiting for a witness nation not to demonstrate its chutzpah or its expertise
39:00 -  he's waiting for a church not to demonstrate its ability but his in a word
39:06 -  the ultimacy of the demand that Israel makes upon the church brings us to the issue of death and resurrection
39:12 -  it is only our witness to them from the place of resurrection
39:18 -  that can conceivably move them to jealousy nothing that is religious however impressive
39:24 -  or however charismatic will do it in a word unless we ourselves are on the resurrection ground
39:30 -  how shall they be moved to jealousy it's just that we're a people with another set of religious priorities and vocabulary
39:36 -  no more impressive than anyone else's or their own are you guys following me?
39:44 -  getting restless? no? okay I'm giving you a compressed
39:52 -  seminar in one night that should have at a minimum three speakings to adequately
39:58 -  suggest it the issue of Israel I want to contend tonight is the issue of the church
40:08 -  and we're going to see that increasingly as we come to the end of the age and I believe that it's the issue
40:14 -  of Israel that will indeed reveal who in fact the church is and in our first speaking in these days we mentioned
40:20 -  a remnant church a persecuted church and a larger religious body who will be
40:26 -  its persecutors employing the same Christian terminology but bereft of its power
40:32 -  who cannot tolerate the existence of that minority of the spirit and it may well be
40:38 -  that the response to the hated people that the Jew will increasingly become in every nation will indeed reveal
40:44 -  who that true church is because I'll tell you what folks even before this
40:50 -  emergency comes and Jews are in that extremity and become yet more hateful and more despised
40:56 -  it's tough even now to relate to them as we ought there's something about a Jew
41:02 -  in the wisdom of God that kind of has a tendency to rub a gentile roar
41:08 -  I don't know why it is but far from outmoving them to jealousy
41:14 -  they move us to envy they provoke us by their success we're irritated by their ability
41:20 -  their effortless seeming wonderment in the obtaining of fortunes
41:26 -  or sailing through schools and getting their straight A's while we break our heads for a B- I'll tell you what it's an unusual
41:32 -  gentile who can witness this and not have in his deepest soul a little kind of enmity
41:38 -  inculcated in a word what I'm saying is that nothing from us
41:46 -  humanly or religiously will fulfill the mandate to which we are called with regard to them
41:52 -  that in a word the only church that will move this people to envy and have a mercy to extend to them
41:58 -  is a church that is utterly transcendent heavenly, apostolic
42:04 -  prophetic, true and what I'm saying further is that we will never obtain that
42:10 -  if we do not take the mandate seriously that compels us to find, to obtain
42:16 -  and to keep that ground in a word we're locked in with the Jew in an inescapable
42:22 -  symbiotic relationship where the one without the other
42:28 -  cannot obtain to its fulfillment in God and God is the author and the genius of that plan
42:34 -  oh the depths of the riches Paul cries out the wisdom
42:40 -  and the knowledge of God who has been his counselor I'll tell you that that ecstatic
42:46 -  pain of praise that concludes the great chapters of Romans 9-11 has got to be a statement of more than the fact
42:52 -  that God intends to save Jews like myself or Gary to be added to the body of Christ we appreciate that
42:58 -  we love that there's an elect a remnant in every generation a remnant in every generation
43:04 -  that God will add to the church but I'm saying tonight that there's a weight, a ponderous weight
43:10 -  of scripture throughout all the prophets from which Paul draws to make his statement in Romans 9-11
43:16 -  that there's a destiny for Israel as a nation a remnant nation not the same great numbers
43:22 -  that exist today a decimated nation passing through a time of Jacob's trouble
43:28 -  through which not all shall survive and I want you to turn with me to Ezekiel 20
43:34 -  to show you how close to home this program of God is going to come
43:40 -  of which we are principal actors and if we fail in the role in which he has cast us
43:46 -  we cannot hope for their restoration I said I expect a global anti-Semitism and I receive publications
43:54 -  from the Jewish community that testify to that you need to know it
44:00 -  that there's a rising crescendo of anti-Jewish hatred growing in every nation in the world
44:06 -  and the lid is off in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and there's not only ethnic hatred surfacing
44:12 -  but anti-Jewish hatred surfacing that the conduct of Israel with the Palestinians has excited
44:18 -  a dislike and a contempt and a hatred for nations as I've said that formerly looked upon Israel in a fond way
44:24 -  and even many Christians are growing cool because of the way Israel is disappointing them this is God's program
44:32 -  it's going to increase and there will be no nation in the world where Jews will be exempt
44:38 -  from a bitterness and a hatred and a fury directed against them to such an extent that it will drive them
44:44 -  out of their present places of security affluence and comfort which is necessary to bring them to a place
44:50 -  of confrontation with God in the wilderness of the nations this is God's stratagem
44:56 -  for the majority of world Jewry in the last days listen to this in verse 33 on
45:02 -  from Ezekiel 20 as I live says the Lord God surely with a mighty hand
45:08 -  and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out I will rule over you remember the last official statement
45:14 -  of the Jewish community we will not have this man to rule over us I will
45:20 -  rule over you I am going to take because of your stubbornness and your pride
45:26 -  a fury poured out with a stretched out arm and I will bring you out from the people
45:32 -  that's what will do it and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered with a mighty hand with a stretched out arm
45:38 -  and with fury poured out and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will I plead with you face to face
45:44 -  like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so will I plead with you sayeth the Lord God
45:50 -  I will cause you to pass under the rod and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant and I will purge out from among you the rebels
45:56 -  and them that transgress against me and I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn
46:02 -  but they shall not enter into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord
46:08 -  I want to be on record tonight and I pray that I'm wrong I'd rather be dismissed as a false prophet
46:14 -  I'd rather be an error that my people would be spared what I suspect these verses mean
46:20 -  in a calamity that shall soon come upon them worldwide namely a fury poured out
46:26 -  in such a magnitude of which the Nazi experience was a precursor
46:32 -  and a foreshadowing of what will now become a global phenomenon even right here in River City
46:38 -  if you say it can never happen in America I mean we're true blue
46:44 -  we're apple pie we're democratic come on you simpletons
46:50 -  if it could happen in the land of Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven Fichte, Hegel, Nietzsche, Schiller
46:56 -  in the land of a brilliant 2000 year old civilization within a decade that the scum
47:02 -  of its society can meet in a beer hall the rejects, the homosexuals the occultists
47:08 -  and take the reigns of state in a reign of terror against this people do you think that we will do better?
47:16 -  all nations shall come against Jerusalem to destroy it
47:22 -  and the question that the true church of God needs now to ask and to prepare itself is this, where shall we stand
47:28 -  in that day? it's the question that the church in Germany essentially
47:34 -  failed to answer and became the national church with the furious photograph
47:40 -  on its walls and silent and looking away at the information of the lost sheep of the house of Israel
47:46 -  in their own midst as a man who later came to the Lord told me a German man who lived through that period in Berlin
47:52 -  and knew many Jewish people as business associates I said well, what did you do?
47:58 -  he said well Artie, I looked out of my apartment window and I saw the brown-shirted Nazi youth
48:04 -  beating the stuffings out of them and pulling the beards of these elderly Jews and breaking their store windows
48:10 -  and I said well what did you do? he said I pulled the shade down and I walked away
48:16 -  I want to tell you folks, put this tape on the shelf
48:22 -  and take it down periodically and have it in your possession before this decade ends
48:28 -  when God says that by your mercy they might extend mercy he's not talking about some light
48:34 -  piece of fluff that you can expend without cost it will be a mercy that may require
48:40 -  your life that to extend yourself to this despised people when they shall be hated of all nations
48:46 -  and be driven by a satanic fury expressed as anti-Semitism to take them in, to provide them a place
48:52 -  of refuge is to do so at the peril of your own life
48:58 -  and yet God says there I will meet with them in the wilderness of the nations in the offbeat places
49:04 -  away from the major cities, in little obscure places like La Porte, Minnesota
49:10 -  or somewhere in West Virginia or in the desert some place
49:16 -  and in the many places where God has shown and is showing me now little agricultural places that can
49:22 -  sustain life, grow food, provide shelter are being already prepared
49:28 -  by God as a network of places of refuge for Jews in flight in this very
49:34 -  country now the Lord's injunction that to avoid the mark of the beast that we should begin to ourselves
49:42 -  in good sense and wisdom to anticipate and to prepare and look to the development of community
49:48 -  in an agricultural base is not only a provision for our survival but may likely be theirs
49:56 -  this is his program, I didn't make it up there I will meet with them in the wilderness of the nations
50:02 -  face to face I'll tell you what they better see something more
50:08 -  than what perhaps I'm looking out at tonight they better see something of the light that lightens the gentiles
50:18 -  which is also the glory of the people Israel you want to know something folks
50:24 -  why I'm here tonight why I'm alive tonight, why I'm in God's service tonight, because 26 years
50:30 -  ago as a man who was brought down into the place of death an obumptuous, hot shot, arrogant
50:36 -  self-sufficient, conceited Jew full of opinions coming to the end
50:42 -  of my own confidence in recognizing the paucity and the bankruptcy of my empty humanistic
50:48 -  slogans, unable to continue as a teacher, having nothing to offer my students, but to raise questions that I
50:54 -  could not myself answer, took a year's leave of absence and put a pack on my back and began moving around in the western
51:00 -  world of which we Jews are so much the architects and the formers looking for philosophical answers
51:06 -  for what else shall an atheistic Jew seek only to find day by day
51:12 -  in the book that is available tonight at the back of the room called Ben Israel which is the journal of that journey
51:18 -  that there was a God looking for me, picking me up off the side of the road and bringing me
51:24 -  into an encounter with another race of people a new creation
51:30 -  who were Gentiles yet not Gentiles something transfigured in them, something
51:36 -  transcendent in them, whose faces shone, who had a word that penetrated my dark and unbelieving heart
51:42 -  and in the midst of this dealing in the city of Zurich I meet
51:48 -  this American high school girl just graduated and on tour as a graduation gift from her family
51:54 -  a Gentile of the Gentiles a waspish middle class little snippet of a girl who should have
52:00 -  moved me to the kind of anger and contempt that such symbols of
52:06 -  Protestantism have always affected in arrogant New York Jews but I'll tell you what, there was something
52:12 -  that little girl that took the steam out of me there was a simplicity and a transparency
52:18 -  there was a fearlessness somehow we ended up spending the afternoon together walking the woods
52:24 -  surrounding that city and I kept pumping her with questions as an ex-Marxist and ideologue who had taken on causes
52:30 -  and yet can rub my heel into the face of closest neighbors and family
52:36 -  how come you've been kind to me? oh she answered it's the love of God, how come you're willing to
52:42 -  be patient with me, it's the love of God, how come you're willing to spend this time with me, the love of God, if I heard the love of God and God one more time I would have
52:48 -  shrieked and I thought if this kid mentions God one more time in this afternoon she's going to get it
52:54 -  my hobby was to engage Christians in debate and wipe them out so what was this little
53:00 -  middle class Protestant from the Midwest to me sure enough she
53:06 -  mentioned God again, I said okay kid hold it you're sweet and all that but listen I can't stand this God talk
53:12 -  answer me one question that no Christian has ever successfully answered for me, you've been talking about
53:18 -  God all afternoon, how do you know that he is? I thought ha ha, got her I'll get my steam engine all revved up
53:24 -  and I'll crush the life out of her I'm waiting for that hesitation that's spluttering in a choke and that she'll think of something
53:32 -  clever she learned in Sunday school and I'll take it apart, without a moment's hesitation she tilted up this little
53:38 -  gentile but not gentile face and said to me with complete sincerity Archie said, I know
53:44 -  that God is, he lives in me for a man who could not stand cliches
53:52 -  I went down like a struck ox that was not a cliche though it could be in the mouth of others
53:58 -  when I got to my feet recovering from the power of that statement thinking to myself, what gave
54:04 -  it that power? It was not theological let alone intellectual and finally realizing that the power of the statement
54:10 -  was its truth and that she had the face to prove it
54:16 -  I saw the light to lighten the gentiles which is also at the same time the glory of the people of Israel
54:22 -  and I want to say in the last day folks my Jewish people are not going to see that glory except in the light of your
54:28 -  faces and I will meet with them face to face
54:34 -  how can he be in so many places over the world where he's preparing these places of refuge and flight
54:40 -  except that he has a people in them who so reflect him that to meet them is to meet
54:46 -  him for there they will come under the rod of his authority there's a real mercy that's going to be required
54:52 -  of us and we better have it in a palpable and real way you know there's something about the Jew
54:58 -  that flushes us out there's something about the issue of the Jew that finds us out for those of us who
55:04 -  subscribe to the correctness of the doctrine of mercy how many of us are living effectually as Pharisees
55:10 -  who believe that what we have received from God is proportionate to our good works or to our merit
55:16 -  because when I say to you that God will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy your first response to me is
55:22 -  but they don't deserve it I'll tell you what that says more about us as the church than it says about them
55:28 -  there's a reason why God has placed them in our path we need them as desperately and urgently as
55:34 -  they need us we're locked in and the one without the other can never succeed in the ultimate
55:40 -  intention of God by which you'll be glorified it's the issue of Israel alone that is most calculated to stretch
55:46 -  the church and bring it to the ultimate faith and obedience and prophetic
55:52 -  stature and here's the point with which I want to end who is that son of man
55:58 -  who is that prophetic company who speaking brings a nation from death
56:04 -  to life if it is not us the church in its final and ultimate prophetic
56:10 -  configuration who speaking is more than a matter of opinion or a medley of voices
56:16 -  but a single unity and agreement formed by God that is authoritative and
56:22 -  constitutes an event does your faith balk at this
56:28 -  here's what I believe folks we are on a destined course that
56:34 -  requires us to come to such a place in God that our speaking in
56:40 -  agreement in one mind and one soul and in one spirit with the full conviction of prophetic
56:46 -  faith in the moment that God requires it as an act of obedience will be the issue of the life
56:52 -  or the death of this people if we choke and stumble and falter if we are not in agreement that we have people of varying
56:58 -  voices and discord and disagreements it will not be that singular and authoritative
57:04 -  speaking that can raise the dead how do we come to that condition from where we presently are in the medley
57:10 -  of voices that we presently represent as the collection of individualities that we presently constitute
57:16 -  we need to come to a constituency of things that is corporate, one mind
57:22 -  one voice but not by some process by which it's imposed upon us or some automation or
57:28 -  some religious processing but by the precious sanctifying
57:34 -  work of God that brings us increasingly to the agreement with him that is the work of
57:40 -  his spirit that is it took one voice in an Israel in an agreement in a moment
57:46 -  when the priest blew their trump to give a shout that brought the wall down
57:52 -  that opened up the possession of the land there's going to be a historic moment or
58:00 -  a collection of moments where that kind of authoritative word must come
58:06 -  from the church or it will not come at all a word that is more than opinion and a word that is more
58:12 -  than correct it's a word that constitutes event, it's a creative word
58:18 -  it's a prophetic word that only a people who have come to that kind of maturity and unity and agreement
58:24 -  can speak. We need to be on a course right now that will move us increasingly from
58:30 -  where we presently are as the collection of individualities to become that prophetic
58:36 -  entity in God that can respond to his
