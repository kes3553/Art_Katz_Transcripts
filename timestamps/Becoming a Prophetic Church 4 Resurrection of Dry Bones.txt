Becoming a Prophetic Church 4 Resurrection of Dry Bones

00:00 -  that you would give him the tongue of a pen of a ready writer and you would fill him with joy in the name of Jesus. Amen. Good morning saints.
00:24 -  Well there's a text that we must not ignore that requires to be exposited by a speaker who is beside himself
00:34 -  for your sake and for his sake. The text requires that and that text is Ezekiel chapter thirty-seven the valley of dry bones.
00:45 -  A classical text rich and potent, mighty in meaning
00:53 -  and it requires that kind of lavish exposition that only the Spirit of God can give. It can never be clinical or dry and in fact probably no two speakings about it or from it would ever be the
01:06 -  same. But there's no way to consider the subject of Israel and circumvent this text.
01:17 -  So I want to read again from my seminary Bible Ezekiel thirty-seven the hand of the Lord came upon me
01:26 -  and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the middle of a valley. It was full of bones. He led me all around them.
01:37 -  There were very many lying in the valley and they were very dry. He said to me, son of man, can these bones live?
01:45 -  I answered, oh Lord God you know. Then he said to me, prophesy to these bones and say to them, oh dry bones
01:53 -  hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones I will cause breath to enter you
01:59 -  and you shall live. I will lay sinners on you and I will cause flesh to come upon you
02:05 -  and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and then you shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I had been commanded and as I prophesied suddenly
02:16 -  there was a noise, a rattling and the bones came together bone to bone. Looked and there were sinners on them and flesh had come upon them and skin had covered them
02:27 -  but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, prophesy to the breath, prophesy son of man and say to the breath
02:35 -  thus says the Lord God come from the four winds o' breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live.
02:43 -  I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and they stood on their feet a vast multitude. Then he said to me, son of man these bones
02:54 -  are the whole house of Israel. They themselves say our bones are dried up
03:01 -  and our hope is lost. We are cut off completely. Therefore prophesy and say to them
03:08 -  thus says the Lord God I'm going to open your graves and bring you up from your graves all my people and I will bring you back to the land of Israel
03:18 -  and you shall know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and bring you up from your graves all my people I will put my spirit within you
03:26 -  and you shall live and I will place you on your own soil then you shall know
03:32 -  that I the Lord God I the Lord have spoken
03:36 -  and will act says the Lord. Amen.
03:40 -  So precious God breathe upon these bones and upon your congregation that expression my God of the spirit of life
03:52 -  that enables us even to consider a text as potent as this and draw out from it my God what you will
04:01 -  and sink it deep into our hearing and into our foundations into our whole understanding of the mystery of Israel the church the last days all those things that are
04:12 -  intrinsic to the comprehension of the church that is called not merely to observe
04:19 -  but to be not merely to participate but to be the agent of this restoration as the son of man
04:27 -  a prophet prophetical company that can be commanded
04:32 -  so we thank you and give you praise my God come and open this remarkable text in the way that it pleases you this morning
04:39 -  and receive now our gratitude for the privilege of it Lord in Jesus name. Amen.
04:48 -  Well certain preliminary observations that this that God is the causative agent
04:57 -  exclusively and that the situation is so bereft of any hope
05:04 -  from man that even the prophet himself must stagger when God raises the question can these bones live
05:13 -  that Israel is reduced to such a place that there's no prospect whatever of recovery from any source
05:21 -  other than God himself and that's why the reiteration of the phrase
05:27 -  I will I will I will
05:30 -  I will raise you up out of your grave I will put my spirit I will bring you into the land so we mustn't
05:37 -  lose note that this takes place outside the land and in fact we're told that these are the slain
05:45 -  in the nations and then a resurrection
05:49 -  and then a return to the land so evidently this is a little conflict with the usual assumption
05:56 -  that the state of Israel is already the dry bones coming together and it's more a progressive work and that subsequently flesh will be added and then finally the spirit
06:06 -  and Israel will be the hope for prophetic fulfillment but this is a much more
06:14 -  apocalyptic scenario this implies violence and devastation this implies expulsion
06:22 -  this implies that the profound act of God toward Israel is not in the land but outside it and in the nations
06:29 -  and then the return after the remarkable supernatural work on a nation that has been reduced
06:36 -  to the total finality of death and death in so uttermost a form
06:43 -  that it becomes dry bones well I'm fanatical enough in times past when I've spoken from this text I used to carry a bone with me
06:54 -  and circulate it as I'm speaking starting with the first one in the first row and they would hand it on and go through the
07:01 -  usually small congregations and by the time it finished passing from hand to hand there was hardly anything left of the bone because it
07:11 -  it turns to dust even in your hands dry bones they granulate they dissolve in powder and so I just wanted to impact the congregation
07:21 -  that when God says dry he really means dry and that there is every reason to reduce Israel to that condition
07:30 -  because Israel is a metaphor Israel is the quintessence of man
07:38 -  in his own hope in his own prowess in his own ability in his own sap his own juice to perform it to establish his own destiny his own will
07:49 -  we are the personification of man man in his own excellence in his own ability
07:55 -  and therefore for that reason and an instruction to the world God has got to take the witness nation
08:03 -  and reduce it until it is incapable of anything in itself what a remarkable contrast to the establishment
08:11 -  of the present state of Israel which though it took place under the what's the word I always forget it
08:19 -  uh... the oversight of God the providence of who said that oh praise the lord
08:29 -  under the providence of God is not the same as the explicit will that pertains to Israel's final restoration
08:39 -  it's a providence it's an approval it's a necessary step toward that fulfillment but it is not the thing in itself so it doesn't take place
08:48 -  despite God or when his back is turned it is serving his purposes but it is largely the work
08:55 -  of man himself human prowess Zionist ability
09:00 -  Jewish finance political connections and the fortunes of history and time
09:06 -  that God himself breathes upon to establish it not that it should succeed
09:12 -  or even survive but to set in motion the process of uh...
09:21 -  of consternation and aggravation on the part of neighbors and other nations that finally reaches a crescendo of violence of expulsion that brings
09:31 -  the whole house of Israel into its graves this is a remarkable text that has components and suggestions of that which is literal
09:42 -  that which is metaphoric that that is allegorical that is symbolic and it's a whole remarkable composition
09:51 -  that we need to uh... thread our way through and unfold but we must take note that these are the whole house of Israel
10:00 -  and that they are slain and that they are in their graves implying a violence
10:06 -  against Jews worldwide and in the nations from which they must be raised
10:12 -  by the action of God himself and that he would employ an agent called the son of man
10:21 -  is something that needs to occupy our attention because I take the prophetic liberty to suggest that that is a symbolic
10:30 -  picture of the church in its prophetic constituency in the last days
10:38 -  that will be the agent of Israel's restoration which is completely in keeping with the whole mystery of Israel and the church as is expressed by Paul in the book of Romans that through your mercy
10:50 -  they may obtain mercy that the function of your salvation is not to be consumed upon yourself but to move them to jealousy
10:58 -  that from the very first stroke the whole advent and the rising up of a church of gentiles by the grace of God
11:06 -  to be brought into the salvation which was exclusively Israel's is largely for Israel's own sake have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid, Paul says
11:17 -  speaking to the Roman church but through therefore salvation has come to you so as to move them to jealousy
11:27 -  right from the first Paul strikes the note of the reciprocity the reciprocal relationship
11:34 -  between Israel and this new entity called the church that the one without the other is incomplete and cannot even come
11:42 -  to the completion of God's intention except in the reciprocal relationship that God in his wisdom
11:49 -  has ordained the church that is not related to Israel and has that nation's restoration
11:56 -  as its principal focus loses the whole purpose of its own being its own cosmic
12:04 -  theocratic purpose and of necessity therefore must have its life
12:10 -  and activity in another kind of context that is less than other than God's intention and therefore the church falls into either being
12:18 -  an institution or a culture a Sunday supplement
12:23 -  but it loses its apostolic reality its apostolic purpose for being does not
12:31 -  take into its consideration the purpose for which God had ordained it from the first to move them to jealousy
12:39 -  and in the end to extend mercy that they may obtain mercy in the process of which in the requirement of which we're called
12:47 -  out from ourselves and into a larger place as i hope to show you from this text
12:53 -  that requires our own resurrection but we cannot fulfill our obligation to that people
12:59 -  out of mere evangelical obligation or charismatic sentimentality
13:08 -  or any other kind of human thing from us but don't you understand that this whole text implies
13:16 -  that the remarkable supernaturalness of God and that Israel is reduced to the state of complete inertness whatever happens to something
13:26 -  of dry bones has got to come from outside it and not from it itself
13:32 -  because the issue at hand is the issue of humanism it's the issue of man it's the issue of human presumption and arrogance
13:39 -  to think that it can and it will and it shall perform and establish even so much as a state
13:46 -  let alone the nation that is to be the prophetic
13:50 -  glory and bless all the families of the earth that can never be the issue of any human accomplishment
13:57 -  even by jews i want to underline that because you think that we have some kind of magical
14:06 -  endowment and some superior enablement humanly
14:11 -  well it's true that there's a remarkable brightness to be found
14:16 -  in that people and they are estimable in their human attainments and that's exactly why
14:23 -  they must be brought into the place of death and death of such a kind that God is not
14:30 -  fishing for an extravagant metaphor when he says dry bones in fact the key verse in the entire text
14:41 -  is verse eleven when they themselves say we are cut off
14:49 -  we are without hope then God acts our bones are dried up our hope is lost we are cut off
15:06 -  completely it waits for the acknowledgement of the nation itself that it is incapable that it is capable
15:14 -  of nothing and i ask you students of history can you show me any instance
15:22 -  in the recent past of the nazi holocaust and the decimation of six million jews that this acknowledgement has ever come forth
15:32 -  nationally has there ever been a moment in the history of the people of Israel
15:38 -  and in modern times even in the debacle of the holocaust itself in which the nation has ever made
15:44 -  this confession for which God yet waits i think he's not only waiting for it from the
15:51 -  from the from Israel he's waiting for it from the church when we ourselves will say we are cut off
15:57 -  we are as dry bones not that we can't perform services and establish programs
16:04 -  and provide a modicum of blessing but in terms of the calling of God and the apostolic and prophetic
16:11 -  requirement of the church uh... it's like abraham
16:16 -  uh... being uh... was it ninety nine years old and looking at his body as good as dead have you ever felt
16:26 -  that sense of inadequacy have you ever said with Paul who is sufficient for these things
16:33 -  i know you haven't because you've never had the occasion that would require it until
16:39 -  you took the mystery of Israel to your heart seriously
16:45 -  and began to realize what what is the magnitude of our calling as the church to be the salvific
16:53 -  agent of God for Israel's redemption for if Israel remains a pile of dry bones
17:00 -  how shall the thing that Paul spoke in romans eleven be fulfilled what shall their return be but life from the dead we cannot even begin to estimate
17:13 -  what it will mean for the nations their ecology and spirituality their morality when a nation of priests
17:23 -  comes into their midst and that the law shall go forth out of their zion what how it will affect the whole
17:31 -  tenor and composition of life
17:35 -  when that nation is restored from the dead Paul says it's nothing less nor other than life from the dead if their falling away has brought blessing to the gentiles
17:45 -  what shall their return be but life from the dead but they've got to return and they've got to come out of death themselves in order to
17:56 -  bring that life but the last note that we have is in history
18:01 -  to which Israel is presently moving as the noose tightens both in the land and outside it
18:08 -  of the threat of physical violence which can hardly be contained and hold your breath till the next bus explodes or suicide bomber
18:17 -  and that the wall that has been erected can be bridged in a moment by tunneling under going over or devastating it isn't it remarkable how precarious that nation is
18:28 -  that there's no mountain range to protect it no vast body of water that it's so close to its enemies that seek its annihilation
18:38 -  that it takes only a few minutes and even in some not only jet planes and bombers but by missile seconds to traverse the distance that would
18:47 -  destroy entire cities in the entire land by germ warfare or gas or atomic all of the lethal things
18:57 -  the weapons of mass destruction cannot be contained you cannot build a defense against them
19:05 -  you can only hope that through new treaty and negotiation to defuse the enemy to keep it from the employment of those devices that would mean certain death
19:17 -  I want to say that Israel's geography and defenselessness is not a geographical accident but a planned intention of God
19:27 -  that the nation must be defenseless and it must make God its high tower and its fortress
19:34 -  or it is without defense can you see of necessity God has so stacked
19:41 -  even the geography of the land and the nature of last day's technology
19:47 -  to make that people absolutely defenseless except that they are in a relationship of trust
19:54 -  with himself so God is no longer just some kind of a Shabbat Saturday consideration
20:01 -  or the issue of keeping kosher and being fastidious
20:13 -  in the details of the law but is the issue of survival
20:20 -  the reality that that's got to be known as the psalmists set forth God as defense and high tower and place and refuge
20:30 -  is not the rhetoric of the Bible but the actuality that God himself can become
20:36 -  to those who are in that kind of relationship by faith with him that he is actually
20:42 -  our defense and we shall not be moved got the picture
20:49 -  well I don't know if you got the picture because how many Christians are in that relationship
20:56 -  that the psalmists continually reiterate not as a piece of
21:01 -  pros or posy or a special kind of language but as the statement of reality to which they have
21:09 -  come so if we're to move them to jealousy not the least of the means is that we ourselves will demonstrate
21:18 -  that we know God and have found God as that kind of refuge and that kind of defense
21:24 -  in the face of a world that is freaking out and that any moment can bring
21:31 -  devastation of kinds that hot and and only a decade ago could not even have been imagined
21:47 -  and yet there are numbers of Christians who are hoping for the progressive amelioration of Israel in the land
21:54 -  yes they're upset and disappointed at certain of the tendencies that Israel is expressing the use of torture
22:04 -  with uh... a captured Hamas terrorist in order to extract information that would save Israel from another unnecessary bombing
22:14 -  what do you do you're just required to employ expediencies to avoid the catastrophe of wholesale death when you have a man who may know something about it
22:25 -  and is not going to share it over a cup of coffee but under the duress of torture so that
22:34 -  the druslim post and other publications and periodicals coming out from Israel and jewish publications in america are already discussing
22:44 -  the probity the sanity the moral necessity for the employment of torture who could have ever thought that jews would be reduced and brought to a place
22:55 -  to take that kind of consideration seriously that even if there's a degree of efficacy and value in the employment of torture
23:04 -  even to the issue of the survival of the state by such a means what does the state itself become morally
23:12 -  can you guys follow that there's a point of no return when you have to employ expediencies of a kind
23:21 -  that bring such an erosion to the moral character of a nation that even if the crisis should pass
23:28 -  the loss is irrevocable it cannot again be retained
23:34 -  God is the author of this predicament you dear saints and you've got to know it and understand why it is that the noose is tightening
23:44 -  and why Israel is even now being brought to a place of irrevocable disaster
23:51 -  and the death and the being slain being in the grave and being reduced to the bones that this text describes how else
24:02 -  shall God's promise to abraham be fulfilled that we ought to be a people who will bless all the families of the earth
24:12 -  notice not impress you would have been satisfied with that if Israel could have by progressive amelioration we've been brought to a
24:22 -  improved condition by which it might have impressed the nations but God says no my intention is not to impress but to bless
24:32 -  the issue this morning and the issue anywhere
24:37 -  with God is the issue of resurrection if this speaking this morning is not out of that life
24:45 -  if we are not moving in that reality there's no way that we can raise those dry bones by anything that we're
24:52 -  commanded to speak to them resurrection is the issue resurrection is the
25:04 -  prime statement of God's glory and he reduces Israel to a place to which he had reduced his own son through death
25:14 -  that he would be raised by the glory of God which is to say his power not from death and be made to ascend on high to a place of exaltation
25:26 -  even at the throne of God if that is the route by which the lord himself attains
25:35 -  to his exaltation and primacy in the world by what
25:41 -  means shall Israel attain to hers except by the same route of death and resurrection and if that's the requirement for Israel the nation
25:51 -  what about the requirement of the Israel that is the church shall we fulfill our destiny and come into the fulfillment of our calling
26:02 -  apart from the necessity of resurrection it's not a doctrine to which God is asking us to subscribe
26:11 -  and to amen its correctness it's a mode of being
26:18 -  to which he's asking us to live and to fulfill the remarkable mandate and requirement that is made of us
26:25 -  that cannot be performed out of our humanity however well-meaning resurrection
26:34 -  is the heart of the matter because it's the issue of God it's the issue of glory it's the issue of the triumph
26:41 -  of God in supernaturalness for all that is celebrated in the world that has to do with man so the redemption of Israel in the land can never be
26:52 -  a humanly achieved proposition but by its very nature requires a total divine enablement
27:02 -  tantamount to creation itself out of hopeless chaos isn't a remarkable parallel what's the word
27:11 -  a paradigm that the very reality by which the cosmos came into being God brooding over the chaos
27:21 -  uh... and moving by his spirit and speaking brings forth creation out of death destitution and chaos
27:31 -  and that the same God who was the creator at the inception of the universe
27:36 -  is the same God that will establish Israel precisely that means again because the issue is not Israel success
27:47 -  but the glory of God as creator redeemer redemption is recreation out of destitution
27:55 -  out of chaos out of collapse out of the out of death which is no prospect of human fulfillment at all
28:05 -  that's the way i felt yesterday morning and to some degree this morning and that's the way any man who's called to speak
28:13 -  from the holy pulpit feels when he has to open his mouth
28:19 -  and standing before God's people in behalf of God and to commence speaking it's an awareness of total human inability
28:32 -  it's death again and some someone wisely said every true preaching
28:38 -  is another resurrection and another raising of the dead in fact this word today this morning is not intended for your edification understanding
28:48 -  although it has that aspect but for your resurrection it's a word that must first bring you into death
28:56 -  and then raise you that's what a true holy ghost spirit inspired word of resurrection power is
29:06 -  that must be characterized in our own proclamation and preaching if one day and soon we have to speak a word that will raise them
29:16 -  which if that crisis was upon us now however precious you are and heads and shoulders above many
29:23 -  you're not yet capable of addressing the dry bones in fact some of you are not even capable of seeing
29:31 -  the dry bones or be willing to see Israel reduced to that condition because your own human sentimentality
29:39 -  and desire for an easier solution to the predicament of Israel that would not require death
29:46 -  prevents you you're not yet taken up with the jealousy for God's glory
29:57 -  that can only be fulfilled and demonstrated out of death and resurrection you would much prefer
30:05 -  a solution for Israel that does not require so severe an alternative
30:12 -  so there's yet there's a death waiting for you in that area of your own humanism because that's what that attitude is
30:20 -  it's humanistic it is self sparing the identification with Israel
30:26 -  to avoid being reduced to that place is really the extension of yourself you yourself don't want to face such calamity
30:36 -  such eventuality either personally or congregationally you would rather succeed
30:43 -  and yet retain your humanity then be brought to death in it to move into a transcendent realm beyond anything
30:51 -  that can be affected in his well-meaning attention aided and abetted by the holy spirit
30:59 -  into being a resurrection phenomenon a son of man company
31:06 -  that can be commanded to speak and to address those bones though you balk that's why the the whole statement begins
31:16 -  with the hand of the lord coming upon me he brought me down and out and into the valley of dry bones by the spirit of the lord and set me in the midst of the valley that was full of
31:29 -  bones and led me all around them and there were very many lying in the valley and they were very dry to be prophetic
31:39 -  is first not to speak for God but to see as God the prophets were called seers
31:46 -  before they were nabi before they were proclaimers you can't proclaim
31:53 -  in any contradiction with what you're not first willing to see as truth prophetic seeing is a remarkable kind of perception
32:06 -  most of the church knows little about and i've just come from an episode at our own place at the conclusion
32:15 -  of a convocation where i was required to make a final address based on a perception
32:23 -  of a reality brought by another speaker who preceded me
32:29 -  who is the co-author of one of my books and a jewish brother and one with whom i've been in relationship more than a quarter of a century and make him the object
32:38 -  of my final statement and critique at the cost of his embarrassment and humiliation because it was
32:47 -  necessary for the edification of the church who was impressed with the outward and external mastery
32:54 -  of this man in his teaching and proclamation from the book of romans to show them that though the content was impressive
33:04 -  the delivery was not out of the life of God but out of the life of man and out of the realm of soul
33:12 -  that however much it has impressed you it is facetious and is not the ground upon which God would establish his church and call for its
33:21 -  use in the last days that out of his life and not out of the church's soul it was an expensive presentation
33:30 -  and i'm still paying the price that i will continue which is another aspect of propheticness is the reproach
33:38 -  that the man of God bears because what he sees is so unique and what is required to address
33:46 -  is so unusual that the best of saints especially because they are best will be offended
33:54 -  by that obedience and i'm saying these things
34:02 -  not because there may be here and there a sprinkling of men called to this calling
34:09 -  but because the church itself has this calling the church itself is called to propheticness its constituency, its knit
34:19 -  the fabric, the makeup, the density, the quality of its life must be prophetic or it's not the church it's got to be a son of man company
34:29 -  and the heck of it is this it's not some individual virtue also that God is going to summon to address the bones it's going to be a corporate statement
34:40 -  of a people who are in agreement who see as God sees and can be commanded to speak
34:47 -  when God requires it and speak
34:51 -  not out of well-wishing i hope it works out of human
35:00 -  effort but out of resurrection authority and power itself because they have been dealt with
35:08 -  in the areas of their own lingering humanisms especially as it hides itself in the attitudes
35:16 -  with regard to Israel itself for their sentimentality humanism, idealism
35:25 -  insinuate themselves in a way that we can hardly identify and recognize it in fact we will be applauded for it
35:33 -  because it seems to be so commendable that you have this affinity for Israel yes but whose affinity is it
35:45 -  does it issue out of the heart of God out of a love that cannot be offended against
35:53 -  ultimate that requires nothing for itself in return or is there some symbiotic kind of a thing going on
36:00 -  an affection and esteem for that people by which somehow your own esteem is linked and joined
36:07 -  and that you derive a benefit from this kind of symbiotic relationship with Israel that you can't even recognize
36:15 -  and for which you'll be applauded especially by jews and yet
36:21 -  ironically it is that persistent human thing
36:26 -  however impressive and attractive that keeps us from the totality and the reality of God
36:34 -  and the life of God which is the power of God that alone can raise those bones from the dead can you follow me you dear saints
36:45 -  you'll not hear this from another thousand speakers we are the enemy not in our carnality
36:59 -  in our spirituality not in our indifference to Israel in our identification with Israel but it's an identification
37:09 -  that issues out of our humanity out of our sentimentality out of idealism and not out of a union
37:18 -  with God and his love for that people which is altogether different than other
37:25 -  than what issues from man from the out of their own humanity can you understand that even if we could get ourselves together
37:33 -  to be commanded by God to address the bones in the moment that he requires it i can tell you that when that moment comes you're not going to feel like it i can't think of any moment to which i have been called
37:45 -  in the service of God in forty years that i've ever felt like it including coming here
37:52 -  including beginning here including this morning
37:59 -  it's a remarkable conundrum that is not at all accidental that the greatest requirements of God
38:07 -  come not when we feel like it but when we feel less like it when we're not feeling spiritual when we're not inspired
38:14 -  when the spiritual adrenaline is not flowing then God requires the obedience because he doesn't want to be
38:21 -  in any way beholden to you or anything that issues from you or from me
38:27 -  as a requisite for his expression we have got to be dead
38:35 -  even in the even in the thing that we covet and desire we want to be fitted
38:42 -  and uh... we want to feel that sap flowing and and the excitement and the inward thing that would give us a little flourish a
38:49 -  little takeoff but to begin from ground zero as stone-cold dead
38:55 -  not an iota of of inward excitement or inspiration and to begin and open your mouth as i've done this morning
39:06 -  it's a reenactment of the central drama of the indisputable and irrevocable nexus of reality the principle of God
39:15 -  himself and resurrection again and again and again
39:20 -  to as many as will and there's not many who will that's why we have a whole generation of men
39:31 -  with the gift of gab and the anointing of human personality that know how to do it
39:37 -  and can perform it at will i'm always suspicious of any man who runs to the platform
39:44 -  and is ready to go and is just missed the personality
39:51 -  in the moment rather than coming as a snail reluctant and unwilling feeling
39:58 -  like you're nothing but the embodiment of death itself and capable of nothing we've got to taste death saints not just once
40:08 -  but frequently if not continually and that's why our whole community after ten years of the greatest struggle in northern minnesota
40:16 -  living beneath the poverty level with fifty five or more souls dependent upon God and forbidden by him to make
40:24 -  our need known anywhere at the very generation in time with the prosperity message was at its height and glass cathedrals were being built everywhere
40:33 -  we were languishing and our tongues were sticking out for the mere subsistence for life in sub-arctic northern minnesota where winter is nine months of the year twenty below zero
40:47 -  ten years of that struggle and just when we're beginning to succeed and see daylight at the end of the
40:56 -  tunnel God requires the death of the community the dissolution of the entire thing
41:05 -  ministry and all and to vacate the property the hundred sixty acre farm that God had given and to be dispersed
41:14 -  to wherever the lord would direct and allow that property to languish and be accessible to the vandals and to the weather
41:21 -  without any explanation for the requirement of our expulsion
41:27 -  which heightens the death i keep it you got the picture i keep asking
41:34 -  can you follow that can you understand the the divine logic that requires it from prophetic men
41:44 -  and a prophetic community has got in itself in some measure to experience the kind of thing
41:52 -  that is yet to be the experience of the nation itself of expulsion and exile so that when we shall speak to it of restoration and recovery
42:02 -  as we now can these many years later after three years in the grave we do not speak out of a sense of academia
42:11 -  or abstract principle but out of the reality of having been brought both through expulsion and restoration
42:20 -  death and resurrection and every day is another enactment in one measure or another including now you're not going to come to this in a final moment
42:35 -  if you're not consistently in this reality in all your moments if you're unaccustomed
42:45 -  to death and resurrection and have shunned it and continue to live and act and serve God out of your impressive humanity
42:54 -  when that moment comes you'll be totally unable to meet it because however well meaning your intention and however impressive
43:03 -  you're speaking those bones will not budge until they hear a word of resurrection authority and power itself by a faith that believes for that
43:16 -  for when the prophet himself was taken up down and out and into those bones and circulated among them to get the grit of that death into his eyeballs
43:26 -  and into his innards the Lord mocked him and tempted him and said son of man
43:34 -  why do we hear this so frequently in this text son of man son of man
43:40 -  you sweating palpitating piece of humanity you charismatic darling that woos them by the thousands
43:49 -  can you now believe that those bones could live Lord thou knowest this is beyond my charismatic faith
44:00 -  this is beyond even my New Testament prophetic ability that so many have lauded and applauded which serves the purposes of Charismatica beautifully
44:11 -  you can have all kinds of conferences and maybe even receive a personal word of prophecy but when you face the issue of Israel as dead
44:21 -  and dry and hopeless and inert in that moment you'll recognize how fraudulent how shallow
44:32 -  how deceptive was your own assumption of your propheticness that served the purpose of your charismatic culture
44:40 -  but cannot serve the purpose of this apocalyptic destiny got the pick at you and maybe God gave the charismatic thing
44:52 -  not that it should continue or be embellished like flaying a dead horse but that it should be brought to death
45:00 -  and not clutched and that we were afraid to let go and isn't that the history of the church everything that God has given is clutched
45:08 -  so that when the next wave comes it's resented and resisted by that people who have received the previous blessing
45:16 -  and don't want to relinquish that to go on to this relinquishing is dying not that it was not good
45:24 -  not that it was not given but it wasn't given to be maintained and held it was given to yield and to relinquish
45:30 -  and give up and die to it even though it has now become so familiar and you want to retain it
45:39 -  and God says if you don't let go with that sentimentality that disposition, that attitude
45:46 -  which does something for you it's a subtle form of self-exaltation it attests to your spirituality
45:53 -  that you have this regard for that nation and that people when others are just increasingly hostile and anti-Semitic
46:01 -  you don't want to let go you would want to clutch that sentimentality which is the greatest obstruction to the receiving
46:09 -  of the life of God which is love and I'll tell you what if you can even summon the faith to speak to those bones
46:17 -  but it's not a faith that works with love they'll not move you see the requirement?
46:26 -  see the ultimacy of the crisis that Israel in her death presents to the church called to be a son of man company
46:39 -  that is to say that the pockets of opinion and differences between us which we can overlook if it doesn't agitate
46:49 -  and cause strife will impede our speaking with one voice in the moment that God will require it
46:57 -  there has got to be an agreement that is more than ceremonial or compelled we have got to agree with God as well as see with God
47:09 -  so that our personal opinions that are in any way at odds one with another and with him will prevent that one speaking alone
47:20 -  that raises the dead talk about the unity of the body of Christ talk about ecumenicism
47:30 -  talk about all of the queasy shallow attempts at outward and superficial external harmony bear hugs and back slaps on the platforms
47:40 -  with priests and turnaround callers as if that represents the reality for which God waits I want to tell you this dear saints
47:49 -  and I'm not expecting you to understand it in the hearing but you'll have the tape to consider the unity for which God waits
47:57 -  that makes the one word that he shall command a word that will raise the dead will not be obtained without suffering
48:06 -  that agreement that coming eye to eye that being of one mind and one heart and soul
48:13 -  that characterize the church is the issue of the cross and I'm speaking out of 30 years of community experience and I've heard more scripture quoted in people
48:26 -  supporting their opinion and validating their view than I can begin to say and yet someone else equally has another opinion
48:37 -  in which he can find scripture to fortify and there's the church with its variable and diverse opinions
48:44 -  but not of one mind, one heart and one soul God is not going to stamp us out off of a production line he's waiting for and seeking and working to obtain
48:54 -  an agreement of mind and heart and will by which opinion and differences and the uniquenesses of our individuality
49:05 -  that are to be submitted to the cross there's a process of death that must come to the church
49:12 -  if we are to be the agent by which life will come to Israel can I say it any more clearly? and it's got to be a willing death
49:30 -  God has found us out and cut us off at the pass if you profess to be concerned for Israel and the Jew then are you willing to allow me my dealings with you
49:41 -  of a kind and in areas that you would not have suspected even existed let alone need to be identified and met in the power of the cross which never is pleasant at any moment and yet required
49:55 -  and where is the greatest working out of this depth of sanctifying process? it's in the church as community not in the church that is the mere amalgam of souls
50:07 -  who will come together for the purpose of a service and sit alongside one another but not be with one another got the picture, can you see it?
50:16 -  community is not a little ideal alternative to church it is church and there the friction, the intensification of life
50:27 -  the issues that arise are stupefying you spit your guts out you didn't know that the finest Christians can be such a vexation
50:37 -  so long as you met them only on Sunday and midweek service but when you live with them continually as a community of believers my God, what a shock of the truth of their condition
50:53 -  and the worst and most horrible is the revelation of your own so I don't believe that a son of man company is going to emerge out of the framework of our contemporary church
51:13 -  that even because of its numbers must be essentially impersonal and deny the Lord his opportunity for the sanctifying work that only takes place with a frequency of relationship
51:28 -  in the intensification of life that community is and the great obligation of the leaders of the church today in my opinion is to move it from its present configuration
51:40 -  however much the services are enjoyable into that framework of life for the want of a better word called community where this sanctifying work of dealing
51:50 -  with our privatistic impulses and opinions and individuality and all the kinds of things that impede that oneness that God waits for as a son of man company will be obtained
52:02 -  where the death can work, that life can go forth the issue of Israel is not Israel the issue of Israel will be inert
52:13 -  dry bones, incapable of anything and acknowledging for the first time in its history that we are cut off, we are without hope
52:23 -  even though our national anthem is Hatikva the hope, but it's not a hope in God and every false hope that is essentially rooted in man
52:38 -  rooted in state, rooted in institutions rooted in tradition, rooted in whatever needs to be brought into death
52:48 -  and that's what Israel represents as a demonstration of God's awesome cosmic principle by which all nations must be instructed at Israel's expense
52:58 -  as well as Israel herself for she is the epitome of man in his self-sufficiency and ability
53:07 -  even in the generation of his own false hopes so there's a word that follows Ezekiel 37-11 and that word is therefore
53:25 -  the moment that God hears the acknowledgement from the nation we are without hope
53:34 -  we are cut off then God turns to the son of man and says now prophesy to these bones
53:58 -  so I prophesied as I had been commanded and we're not accustomed to being commanded
54:09 -  it's not part of our American charismatic Christian culture to be commanded and so if we're offended
54:20 -  and cannot bring ourselves to be obedient to command we may falter at that very moment the prophet prophesied as he
54:29 -  as he was commanded and so must we also and I want to say unless we are being brought into a place
54:38 -  of obedience to commandment we'll not find it in that moment when that moment shall come
54:52 -  and that's why this text is given now to prepare and fit us to be the agent of Israel's restoration
55:01 -  even as in the same moment historically the nation is being fitted for the death to which it must come
55:10 -  and the glory of God be revealed when those bones are raised up out of their graves
55:19 -  and be brought back to the land and then you shall know that I am the Lord unless Israel knows that I am is the Lord
55:29 -  what is the purpose of Israel and how can there be a fulfillment of its own calling to the nation nations unless it knows that I am is the Lord
55:38 -  it's not a superficial knowledge it's not a rabbinical knowledge it's not a theological knowledge
55:47 -  it's the knowledge of the God who raises the dead who makes those things to be which were not God in that way
55:56 -  how can it bless all the families of the earth in that day you will know that I am the Lord who has spoken these things
56:05 -  raised you up out of your graves by a word and will put my spirit within you and you shall live
56:14 -  and I will place you in your own soil then you shall know that I the Lord have spoken I will compare and I will place you in the land
56:23 -  as against your own attempt to establish yourself you'll see the difference when God himself is glorified
56:32 -  in the remarkable supernaturalness of establishing his people in his land by his own power through his own spoken word
56:41 -  and the issue of his spirit as against the attempt of men humanly, politically and militarily to establish themselves
56:50 -  it's an expensive lesson but it's needful in view of the millennium and the eternity to which Israel shall be
56:59 -  a statement to the nations of the reality of that God by which they were allowed to be brought into death
57:08 -  having been given the room to seek to establish their own reality to exacerbate their neighbors and bring about the forces
57:17 -  of resentment and opposition and violence that finally pursues them into the grave at which time God himself when they come to the point
57:26 -  of destitution and hopelessness will raise up an answer by a people
57:35 -  that Israel would never have suspected would have been the agent of their restoration of that Gentile church
57:44 -  why does God need a son of man after all why doesn't he directly speak to those bones as he directly addressed the chaos and creation
57:53 -  wouldn't he have then received the eternal acclamation of the nation as being their deliverer
58:02 -  why does he need a son of man to fulfill a mystery of God and Israel
58:11 -  that Israel will be eternally indebted to a Gentile people to have been the agent of their
58:20 -  restoration where they would have least expected it in the mystery of God because they would know
58:29 -  that this was not some technical act that God required of that which is called the church for the convenience
58:38 -  it's an act of uttermost sacrifice it's the result of the debts to which they were willing themselves to be submitted which would not have been required
58:47 -  except for the fulfillment of this mystery they would have been satisfied to have been a church of a lesser kind sufficient for their own services and conduct and programs
58:56 -  but for Israel's sake that it might bless all the families of the earth as life from the dead
59:05 -  this is a people willing to experience multiple deaths in the area of their own life
59:14 -  to be that one people, that son of man company that can be commanded and to receive a faith
59:23 -  beyond its own ability to believe that a word that is spoken can raise the dead all the more because it beggars
59:32 -  and stretches faith to the breaking because the word has to proceed from our mouths we have to speak it
59:44 -  it's the word that we speak in union and agreement that will raise that dead it's the faith beyond our faith
59:53 -  that has got to be imparted and given to the place of destitution and say, Lord thou knowest
01:00:02 -  and it's not a faith that will work except by love and it's God's love which is so much other than our own
01:00:11 -  to which we have died to the substitutes that it might fill us and that faith might work by love
01:00:20 -  to obtain that restoration and after the bones are joined and the flesh is added
01:00:33 -  there's one final requirement speak to the breath and command the breath to come in
01:00:42 -  for even flesh and bones being come together is still not adequate until the life of God which is the spirit of God and the breath of God
01:00:51 -  is admitted command the breath you dear saints
01:01:00 -  why is that given as a separate command and a final and ultimate requirement because that's exactly where you're likely to balk
01:01:09 -  it's one thing to address bones and flesh and command, but to command breath is to command God for God himself is the Ruach
01:01:18 -  and the breath and the spirit of life draw the line and say, no Lord this far but not that further
01:01:27 -  who am I to command you to command the breath is to command you and my spirituality will not allow that
01:01:36 -  it's impolite, I'm offended that you would require that of me, I cannot I have too much respect for your deity, I cannot tell you
01:01:45 -  God says unless you tell me you have no part with me because your spirituality now is the final
01:01:54 -  obstruction to the ultimate obedience by which Israel shall be delivered you are willing to have your carnality dealt with
01:02:03 -  and your humanity but are you willing to have your spirituality dealt with for to command the breath of God
01:02:12 -  is death that's then the deeps of that where many will draw back and will not be willing
01:02:21 -  to go that far, though God himself requires it because our spirituality is the final idol
01:02:30 -  is the last thing that needs to fall it's the last thing that we're willing to relinquish because look what we have invested to obtain it
01:02:39 -  we've spent a lifetime of spirituality and God says now bring it to death in the act that I'm commanding you
01:02:48 -  to command my breath though it violates the deepest sensibility and what you think would be a
01:02:57 -  transgression against me is really the last hiding place of your own ego your own vanity, your own
01:03:06 -  personality, your own individuality that has taken as its last refuge as it always will when it can no longer hide in carnality
01:03:15 -  or intellectuality, it will hide in spirituality and it needs to be brought to death now and what I'm commanding you to do
01:03:24 -  command my breath to come into them the issue of Israel which is the issue of the nations
01:03:36 -  the issue of the church that has finally come to this ultimate place to which it can only be brought
01:03:45 -  by the crisis of Israel itself and if we had the time and I invite you to do it at your own leisure
01:03:54 -  and look at what follows in chapter 37 is the restoration of the kingdom to this people who have been raised and verse 24 my servant David shall be king over them
01:04:03 -  they shall have one shepherd they shall follow my ordinances, be careful to observe my statutes they shall live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob
01:04:12 -  in which your ancestors lived and their children and their children shall live there forever and my servant David shall be their prince forever
01:04:21 -  this is the eschatological climax, this is the end of the age this is the restored nation, this is the established kingdom this is the greater David ruling and reigning
01:04:30 -  and I shall reign forever and I will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them
01:04:39 -  and I will bless them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary among them forevermore my dwelling place shall be with them
01:04:48 -  and I will be their God and they shall be my people this is the remarkable climax of all the ages for Israel through an everlasting covenant
01:04:57 -  with the people who are famous for covenant failure covenantal failure will have an everlasting covenant
01:05:06 -  and he will bless them and multiply them and honor them by setting his sanctuary among them forevermore my dwelling place shall be with them
01:05:15 -  I will be their God and they shall be my people then the nation shall know that I the Lord sanctify Israel
01:05:24 -  and set his sanctuary among them forevermore Israel shall know that I am the Lord when I shall raise them from the dead
01:05:33 -  and bring them out of the graves and restore them to the land and give them my spirit and the nation shall know when I have made Israel
01:05:42 -  my sanctuary and sanctify them forevermore Lord I am dissatisfied
01:05:52 -  I am not happy with this presentation I don't know what it takes my God but some exercise of your own life
01:06:01 -  to invest these words and that text with a power that breaks through into our deeps
01:06:10 -  that the issue of Israel is the issue of the nations that this remarkable last days restoration out from death
01:06:19 -  it's a man company that is essentially gentile and should have no reason for the willingness for sacrifice
01:06:28 -  to bear deaths of a multiple kind in order to be able to be commanded and to speak in the power of your life through your faith
01:06:37 -  and your love to address those bones it's a mystery it's ultimate it's staggering and the end of it is not only
01:06:46 -  Israel's restoration but that the nation shall know a kingdom is established a David is set over this restored people
01:06:55 -  and your dwelling in their midst and your sanctuary in their midst is the statement to all nations that you alone are God
01:07:04 -  it's the eschatological climax it is the end of the end of the ages and it is a death and resurrection
01:07:13 -  that brings it into being first ours and through ours then theirs and through theirs
01:07:22 -  a statement to the nations for which Israel was intended at the first as a witness that their God alone is God
01:07:31 -  Lord I'm praying you can join me unless you imbue this text and this sharing
01:07:40 -  with the power of your life it will be as dry dust it will be academic
01:07:49 -  it will be just a little splatter of words that bounce off so I'm appealing to you
01:08:01 -  for mercy because in the end it's your mercy that is revealed in the race and the restoration of Israel
01:08:10 -  not because of their deserving but because of what you are in yourself this whole phenomenon this whole restoration
01:08:19 -  the whole bringing into death of the humanism of Israel which is the model and the statement for all the world to emulate which is contrary to God
01:08:28 -  has got to be brought into death that you might through it show to the world what is the central principle of reality
01:08:37 -  the life of God to which all are invited through the same means by which Jesus himself was raised
01:08:46 -  so Lord I'm asking a little miniscule death and resurrection enactment
01:08:55 -  even now to whatever degree this word this morning that was in your sovereign will
01:09:04 -  to get at the heart of this mystery and its ultimate final fulfillment through a church of an ultimate kind
01:09:13 -  whose life is not its own who can be commanded at your will in an obedience
01:09:22 -  to which we are presently unfitted in our own individuality to be able to speak in your authority
01:09:31 -  in your faith through your love words that affect the bones in a way that nothing less or other can
01:09:40 -  for their speaking is your speaking and that's why you say at the end of this text you will know in that day
01:09:49 -  that I the Lord have spoken and performed this come on Lord how can you say that how can you tell us it's the son of man who speaks it
01:09:58 -  what are you trying to say now I have spoken and performed it are you saying that that we will be brought to a place where
01:10:07 -  you cannot say where we end and you begin that it's no longer a Christianity where we exist as entities and you help us to serve you
01:10:16 -  that we're brought into a transcendent place beyond that where there's such a union with you and God begins that our speaking is your thinking
01:10:25 -  speaking our thought is your thought our love is your love our seeing is your seeing and that by such a means you have
01:10:34 -  a union and a bride for the bridegroom who shares the glory of God and is adorned for the bridegroom because she's one with him
01:10:43 -  in such union is that what you're saying and that the only way that this bride is to be obtained through the crisis to the church
01:10:52 -  that is represented by Israel's death and could not be obtained in any other way that all these mysteries come together in conclusion
01:11:01 -  Israel's restoration a bride for the bridegroom by the same process same requirement the same death the same resurrection is that what you're saying
01:11:10 -  then Lord we're as good as dead to think that we're able in any way to fulfill and when we will acknowledge
01:11:19 -  that death and cast ourselves upon your life then there's hope that is hope come my God
01:11:28 -  and hear from the church what you've not heard in modern times that was continually on the lips of the great apostle who is sufficient
01:11:37 -  for these things we have no stomach for community we don't want the suffering and the embarrassment and the humiliation the frictions
01:11:46 -  intentions of life in that intensity we prefer the casual amalgam of saints for the purposes of services and go back again to our unmolested
01:11:55 -  and unharassed privacy we don't want suffering in relationship that makes the church the church
01:12:04 -  but for your namesake for your glory for the coming of your kingdom and your rule
01:12:13 -  for the restoration of a nation that you will make your sanctuary that the nations might know that you are God we are willing
01:12:22 -  so Lord your blessing I pray upon these children and you know what dear saints you can make a little
01:12:31 -  consecration right now where you sit or kneel and tell the Lord that you're willing to be part of the son of man company
01:12:40 -  that is the agent of Israel's restoration no matter what it costs no matter what it requires you're willing for those
01:12:49 -  deaths and you know that they're needful that there are areas in your life that are privatistic selfish vain ambitious
01:12:58 -  opinionated you know that you'll have to experience multiple deaths to be at a place where you can be commanded in union with others who
01:13:07 -  themselves have opened themselves to those deaths that he might have a company that he can command who can speak in his authority
01:13:16 -  and in his faith with his love to bring about that restoration you can transact with God now
01:13:25 -  because it's not for everyone and he will not compel it it's altogether willing and voluntary so I just invite you
01:13:34 -  on your knees on your chair standing sitting transact with this God that you're
01:13:43 -  willing to be part of that formation and give him leave and liberty and you'll be astonished
01:13:52 -  how quickly he will avail himself and what areas he will touch that you would never have suspected that is the operation of death through the
01:14:01 -  cross but the commencement of life union with him so Lord
01:14:10 -  transact with this people what is the purpose of your speaking if it is not transaction if it is not event how
01:14:19 -  is the church to come to that formidable condition by which Israel is to be restored if it languishes and remains in its present state
01:14:28 -  enjoying its services enjoying its individuality enjoying its sentimental affinities but keeping itself from the death that brings it to the place
01:14:37 -  that is needful and alone through which you will work Israel's redemption listen dear saints we're not playing I'm not looking for old to call that has nothing to do with
01:14:46 -  my gratification this is a moment in time that whose time has come there's a historic something that is requiring
01:14:55 -  an acknowledgement in a transaction for which God waits that is voluntary and I'm inviting you to make it
