Theology of Exile 2 of 2

00:00 -  Before the break and I made a reference to the The Holocaust as a burning bush judgment as fire fire fire is always equated with judgment And that the sending of Moses waited for a man who had turned aside to see
00:15 -  This is a whole message that I have it Maybe some of you may have heard it but just to fit it in with what we're discussing now That there's something in the examination of the issues of judgment that fits a man for sending
00:29 -  Particularly as the agent of God's deliverance of a nation out of bondage What implications for our future? That is only to be found in the fire of judgment
00:40 -  And it to turn aside to see and to look into that is no small thing That's because I said before one brother almost had a nervous breakdown doing so it's very painful to consider the issues of judgment and yet in it alone are
00:56 -  Revelations of the knowledge of God that are not to be found in any other place We are suffering as a church From a distorted view of God much more the projection of ourselves
01:08 -  Than what he in fact is in himself for the absence of the consideration of God as judge I Can't say enough about that judgment is central to the whole apprehension of God as God and It's not in contention or in opposition to his other attributes
01:29 -  All the attributes of his character because mercy is only mercy in view of God's judgment Outside of judgment mercy is a sentimentality And it saves us from the distortion of his other attributes to see those attributes in connection with
01:49 -  The attribute of judgment which is predicated on righteousness And of course the greatest evidence of God's Uncompromising jealousy over that is the willingness to submit his own son under the cruelest of deaths to requite
02:06 -  sin for Mankind and for his own people he didn't make light of it If he fully recognized the gravity of sin and the requirement of judgment for it, but he bore it himself
02:21 -  This is a provision a sub and something a potential To bring us into dimensions of the apprehension of God unlike any other subject, but it has been
02:35 -  avoided or Misrepresented or misused even as we were talking in the break about Schindler's List Or the celebration of the Holocaust or the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC or Yad Vashem in Jerusalem
02:49 -  the whole play and Emphasis upon the Holocaust even especially by the Jewish community is not in the sense in which we are now seeking to understand it as judgment And as revelation of the judge who is also the restorer in mercy, but in a more
03:06 -  Self-pitying way of being the victim of the onslaught of powerful forces while we were just ghetto Jews and Harmless in our ghetto Talmud
03:20 -  Life and never again will we allow you know as if that's the point of it there's a greater point of it that has never been understood and never been sought I stumbled into a
03:32 -  Seminar given at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by Jewish organization Renee Briff on
03:44 -  Revisionism that was a remarkable thing. They were lamenting the fact that there's an active movement trying to Nullify the historicity of the Holocaust like it never happened It's just an exaggerated thing that that Jews have employed for their own purposes and
04:03 -  So finally somewhere in the occasion that came I sort of made clear my view That we ourselves are guilty of the very same thing That what others are doing in denying the reality of the Holocaust we have done with the reality of the crucifixion of Jesus
04:24 -  And that whatsoever we have so we are now reaping and that in fact nearly to remember the Holocaust Statistically and to examine how many died and by what kind of gas they were brought to their deaths is
04:40 -  a worse crime than to Pass it over altogether that unless you're examining the Holocaust with the intention of understanding Where God was in the course of it and
04:52 -  Asked the great questions about it. You are in fact guilty of a worse thing than neglecting it all together Of what you're thinking of what you're accusing the revisionist So, I don't know what what effect that had but that's that's a great point
05:08 -  Ezekiel and Jeremiah are exactly the opposite the prophets of exile are men who borrowed in and Dug in and faced the hard questions that that the calamity of exile and Expulsion meant and bought why where is God? What is he saying? What's the meaning and?
05:29 -  pursued that And I write here had such questions been asked about the Holocaust they might not needed to have been raised again It's a real good question of whether if Israel had benefited and
05:45 -  Understood the Holocaust as judgment and all of its previous Calamities as judgment whether they would again need to be Future such judgments, but we know that the future one is final
05:59 -  Out of it we hope will come a redeemed we know will come a redeemed remnant So the ability to raise through the real questions is critical And that's part of the prophetic calling not only about
06:15 -  Sins of Israel, but the condition of the church our own condition to look into something fearlessly I very rarely quote repent rabbinical sources or commend them
06:28 -  But in this one place about Moses turning aside to see I think that the rabbis are right on they say the thing that won God's heart and Allowed him to call Moses out of the burning bush when he saw that Moses turned
06:43 -  Was that when a man will turn aside to see he need not have any assurance He'll ever be able to turn back to where he was before he turned that is to say he can forfeit and lose Everything that he understood about God about faith about itself in that turning you threaten you put in jeopardy
07:04 -  your whole corpus of Understanding that has sustained you until that moment. It's a great risk to turn aside to see Looking into a burning bush, but it's set in motion
07:18 -  The things that made Moses of the liver of his people and I think it's a question before us so I Appreciate the opportunity to probe these things and if the school is not to your benefit is for my benefit
07:34 -  That it gives me occasion to go through these papers and to have interaction over them So to ask questions I often say anybody can give answers, but I find very few who know how to ask questions Searching questions that draw out
07:50 -  the meaning, you know of an event better to be able to raise good questions that to give glib answers and By doing so The author says they significantly expanded the framework of Israelite faith
08:06 -  Through a rediscovery of additional foundations Well, I'll just paraphrase that the raising of the great questions of judgment
08:17 -  expanded the foundations of the faith in the knowledge of God and So even a devastation has
08:28 -  Redemptive prospect And we need additional foundations. We need expanded and enlarged foundations ourselves
08:36 -  About the knowledge of God a deepened understanding of God himself, which is not to say the understanding about God Understanding of God as he in fact is in Himself and not as we thought him to be you know that verse that says you thought I was such a one as yourself
08:57 -  And not only is Israel guilty of that the Israel of the past the church today We do not know as we ought But there's something about raising and examining the great questions of judgment that bring us
09:12 -  to an expanded knowledge of God as he in fact is that nothing else provides So this author calls exile an anti-exodus
09:24 -  Instead of God bringing his people in he's thrusting them out it seems to be a contradiction of every category and how could God do that with the people who are elect and I who are to be
09:37 -  The people of his kingdom and the land out of which his government goes forth to the nations It seems that it is defeating the very purposes of God and that's why The very thought that present Israel could again
09:53 -  Suffer catastrophe and the calamity of expulsion is considered unthinkable It's self-defeating how can God allow that I mean isn't this what we've all long been waiting isn't this what the prophets have promised How could God allow?
10:07 -  Three or four million to return and now to throw them out again and all of these Russians that are now coming This is what I'm throwing into my teeth is God going to allow them to come and then expel them It's unthinkable
10:21 -  But it raises this question What will God allow? How far will he go in the fulfillment of his own redemptive purposes?
10:32 -  Are you presuming to say and to know how far God will go? By that same kind of logic you would have said the Holocaust is impossible and the Jewish community is bewildered That among those who should have perished if God was judging
10:47 -  World Jewry should have been the American Jew It should have been the secular Steven Spielberg's and the and the other guys that we have been mentioning instead the principal victims of the Holocaust were the religious Jews
11:00 -  They it was the Hasidim the the Polish Jewry the heart of orthodoxy that perished as well as some secular ones So how can you say God is judging and how is it just? What does that presume?
11:14 -  That somehow God looked with favor on their religious activity as being somehow Pleasing in his sight We do not know as we ought to know and let God rattle our box and let him
11:29 -  Shake up our every category upside down and inside out. What shall we say about job when God boasts? Have you seen There's such a one in the earth
11:40 -  Who eschews evil who was upright who fears God he boasts on him as the foremost? Statement of Godliness and then allows the most devastating judgments to come totally unrelated to the issue of Job sin
11:59 -  But required to bring even that Godly man to a revelation and the knowledge of God that far exceeded Or I've heard about you by the hearing of my ear, but now my eyes see it and I abhor myself And I repent in dust and ashes
12:17 -  Then God says now He says to Job's comforters who were eloquent in their spirituality You have not spoken as my servant job has spoken my anger is kindled against you
12:30 -  Now pray for them Because you have come to a real place of understanding now you can pray for them I have lost all connection with a fellowship and here's a here's a fellowship that was
12:45 -  celebrated apostolic other fellowships under their oversight and we walked in it was sheer spiritual death and The Lord had me to speak from job and say you guys are not even in the place of job's comforters You you can't even you're not even eloquent about the faith and yet you're celebrating yourself as if you've got it all together
13:05 -  You don't even begin to know as you want to know way. I tell you we've not heard from that since But the wife of the pastor who was like death warmed up when we had dinner in her house that night and every previous time I had seen her
13:20 -  Came alive. She came to us as we're putting way out books. We felt like a turd I mean Shunning us with their shoulders and the despicable things that we had spoken and spoiled their fun and their self celebration
13:34 -  But she had her face. She was alive and thanked us for the word of truth that had come so I'm saying all that to say this
13:46 -  We do not know as we ought to know The church the greatest thing that the church is presently suffering is its inadequate view of God and The principal reason is the omission of things that pertain to Israel by which God intended that we should be instructed
14:04 -  Not only Israel's biblical past, but its recent past Namely the Holocaust and the anticipation of a soon-coming Future of calamity and devastation
14:17 -  Which would bring us a sense of God's fear and the knowledge of how God will go If you've read the book reality, you know my famous encounter with The author of the whole of the great celebrated Jewish author of Holocaust books
14:32 -  Oh, it was Haley was there when I met him At one of his public presentations where he boasted that he was reading the script studying the scriptures with a rabbi twice in the week And I came to him privately after result when I said seeing that you're studying the scriptures
14:50 -  Weekly to what degree would you be willing to acknowledge that the Holocaust and every previous Jewish calamity is the Fulfillment of the scriptures spoken in judgmental for us in the concluding chapters of Leviticus and Deuteronomy You looked at me and said I
15:11 -  I Refuse to consider that it's not it may not be true whether it's true or not. I will not hear of it And I thought to myself that one mentality by the foremost
15:26 -  Proponent and commentator on the Holocaust who won the Pulitzer Prize a celebrated humanist That one statement is sufficient to justify the Holocaust itself. I Will not consider think of what's being said. I
15:43 -  Will not consider God may say so but I will not consider is the very heart of human hubris pride and celebration of man above God which is the
15:59 -  quintessence of what sin is and for which God's judgments fall And that by the right of the Holocaust who lost every member of his family in the Holocaust
16:11 -  Here's a thought that comes to me right now. I've already mentioned the verse in all of their afflictions. He is afflicted He's no passive Observer who looks upon Israel's calamities from a distance. He's in the midst of it. He bears the whole
16:27 -  grievous moral pain But in fact, that's very at the heart of priestly intercession identification
16:35 -  Identification what about ourselves? Their afflictions are coming but what will be our posture with regard to them? Will God allow us to speak to them a word of judgment?
16:47 -  I remember what David said in our prayer time before we pray for these Jewish personalities. Are we condemning them? Is there an identification with them? I think we're going to be required prophetically
17:00 -  To be in the midst and to bear their reflections as our own if we're going to be a voice today That's a credible voice a powerful and a penetrating voice really from a distance. Let alone from a place of contempt Which characterizes many Christian commentators today? There's a contempt for Israel a
17:19 -  judgmentalism and Something in their critical spirit that is barbed God will not give them the privilege of speaking an irracular word of life
17:31 -  This opens up the whole Issue of sin. What is it? You know, and what what is your corporate culpability? You remember that what Jesus said?
17:43 -  For Stephen as your fathers did so do you also you do always greet the Holy Spirit and Jesus said of those who were gilding the the tombs of the prophets Who said if we had lived in the time of our fathers, we would not have done that
17:58 -  He said because you say that upon you will come the guilt of the deaths of all of the prophets from the beginning right to the end because you absolve yourself and remove yourself from the implication in that guilt because you say we would not have
18:17 -  So God has a view that is profoundly different from modern man's As I said before it's on the basis of his view that his judgment comes and not on the basis of our own You imagine the shriek in the owl
18:31 -  When when multitude stand before the judgment seat who have been living self-applauding approving lives and think they're doing God's service And all of a sudden to be judged by another criteria Gods and be totally unprepared for it the
18:46 -  Devastating moral struck that they will take into eternity that will never be relieved the shriek and the howl And if we understood that how much more forcible with our own witness to the unsaved being now So I see even here there's an evangelistic implication and what is our evangelism today by the way
19:09 -  Are you saved brother God has a plan for your life? The benefits that will accrue to you by believing Not at all and being saved from the mortifying the eternal mortification of eternal judgment without remedy
19:23 -  By a people who know the pangs of it So here is a practical issue of Israel is the issue of the church because the church that is not
19:35 -  Evangelistically Effectual who has not a sufficient understanding of the terrors of hell Of the terrors of hell is not the church
19:44 -  It's something less than something other What we're going to see in Israel's final calamity is the reiteration of the suffering and the crucifixion of Jesus himself There's such a remarkable parallel, but they themselves will cry out. No, where is God?
19:59 -  There's gonna be a sense of total abandonment and that's why the prophetic word that comes to them Don't be afraid. Don't fear your God is coming. He will vindicate you He will he will establish you saves people from actually perishing in despair so acutely
20:16 -  Felt will be the sense of God's forsaken and forsakenness of God And how many of us have tasted this In our own walk
20:25 -  Have you gone through an experience in a phase where you feel the total abandonment of God at a time? When when by every reckoning he should be most profoundly present is And you can't explain it that he's not explaining and you just simply have to bear it
20:41 -  Although the scriptures are silent I wonder what Moses's experience was for the 40 years in his wilderness before the call of God came through the burning bush Was he basking in the sense of God's presence in approval or was he experiencing the total?
20:58 -  emptying of a sense of forsakenness and abandonment and maybe Rooting over his the sin of murdering the Egyptian Soldier and feeling like he had really failed God and God allowing him to
21:13 -  Steep in that the total empty and I've experienced some measure that myself unbelievably painful
21:22 -  And one of my earliest experiences was the lifting of the ranking of God while I was giving my testimony You're sailing along with such Supreme confidence and blessing people and at that time God so annoyed that the testimony they would sit for hours to hear every detail
21:39 -  And there came a moment when all of a sudden, you know anything left And I got our work to describe the utter feeling of nakedness Yeah, I was a horrible vacuum and at the silent cry out of my heart young as I wasn't a bit Lord
21:55 -  I understand exactly what you're doing. I was presuming upon you thinking that I was performing something and Nothing came back and the Lord has not had to do that since that point but the memory of it remains
22:11 -  unspeakably painful the sense of abandonment God's forsakenness and So It'll be the nation's experience
22:22 -  Yet to encourage them in hope Is will be the prophetic task the issue of judgment either offends or draws
22:33 -  we'll either look away or look in and It may well be again That those who even have a sympathetic affection for Israel wants so much to see her succeed
22:43 -  That if this devastation comes again, they will be so offended by it and they will say where is God? And how can we have confidence in his word as we thought that that was the restoration that had been promised So we had well, that's the end of our confidence
22:59 -  so this is so critical and that's why even a word needs to go out now and About three or four years ago when the Lord gave me the Ezekiel 37 message and to bring it to Israel the foremost thought in my inner man was
23:12 -  That though if the message may be rejected there needs to be the first sounding of the possibility of a coming calamity Lest when it comes the unwary be divested of their faith in the disillusionment that will fall upon them
23:30 -  That was God's mercy already the first sounding of a thing that that the Christians living in Israel would never have considered it's
23:42 -  Unthinkable and so the title of this paper is thinking the unthinkable. Do we have that capacity? Sin and judgment are inextricably bound up Yeah, so to the degree that we are we're shunning judgment or it offends us to that same degree
23:58 -  We're left with an impoverished understanding of sin itself And if we don't understand sin, how do we understand righteousness? We don't understand judgment How do we understand mercy if we lack both? How do we understand God?
24:11 -  Even that small orthodox segment that will acknowledge that Jewish calamity is relative to sin and even the expulsion from Israel in 70 AD and 587 with the Babylonian captivity
24:27 -  But you know how they define the sin the failure to have put them a scissor on the door Or the failure to have wrapped the phylacteries properly around their arms I mean they it's a majoring in the minors and missing the whole issue
24:42 -  So therefore when I came to a statement in one of the two books that I bought the other day The book by Baron where he says I've got to find this for you. You need to hear it in his exact words He said the rejection and the crucifixion of Jesus
24:57 -  Was the filling up or the bringing into fullness the long history of Israel's apostasy? And when he said that something went click and we got yes Are you blaming us for deicide and the killing are we Christ killers? Is that our sin? No
25:18 -  It's only the final statement of a long-standing Sin a long-standing rejection a long-standing Apostasy it is the final ramification and the outworking of it that when he came whom you were seeking
25:32 -  You not only could not recognize him but were threatened by him and had him destroyed It's the capstone of your sin and until we repent for that We're not even talking about the right sin if we still think that we didn't put the mazuzah on the door
25:48 -  You know that is that little parchment of everything got to be at a certain angle We didn't wind the phylacteries right or we failed to do this or some minor ceremonial lapse
25:58 -  We have not even understood the issue of sin as God himself sees it and how and as the prophets have proclaimed it consistently through all the books so that when I came to a series of talks in Phoenix when I was living out there for a season a
26:15 -  rabbi on a Thursday afternoon gave a talk on The prophets of Israel and began to touch a little bit about their lament and their cry about the sins of the nation and
26:27 -  In the question-and-answer period I was so Deflated the questions were so Remember what I said about asking questions is more important than good as questions were pitiful
26:38 -  So finally I got up in there. I said, can you tell me when historically? Israel as a nation has ever acknowledged the cry of God as expressed through the prophets and the answer was
26:55 -  For the boys So there's a whole indictments. God has a controversy with us, but most Jews overwhelming have overwhelming Overwhelmingly have no knowledge of that controversy
27:09 -  They have no knowledge that there's an issue that is unrequited that God yet waits for and if it does not come we will suffer again Calamity to instruct us in it. And so how is it that they don't know? If they themselves have turned to other sources than the scripture and have not been the people of the book as we're reputed to be
27:34 -  Who should have had the responsibility of making their sin known? Yes, but I mean The rabbis share the failure with the people who outside of them
27:48 -  Who do know the testimony of the prophets the church here? What what hope then to have an understanding of God's view except it would have been communicated to the church in fact Christian
28:02 -  commentators and church figures are now Subscribing to the Jewish interpretation of holocaust as being the failure of Christianity and not the statement of Israel's sin You can imagine not only the understanding that a church might must have to proclaim this to the Jews in the midst
28:19 -  but the courage Let me Just quote directly from the source to show you how
28:28 -  Beautifully he sums this up Exile refuses to fit the main models used to understand how God revealed himself in and through the Old Testament It doesn't fit how it has to how is the God of mercy allowing this
28:44 -  one would have no way of holding together how the God of Israel could make unconditional promises of punishment and Extermination and a few chapters in a few years later promise unconditional and sweeping deliverance Thus the traditional theological conservative model for understanding has great difficulty
29:04 -  dealing with the unique Issues of exile and the inner dynamic of the faith that can alone respond to it So it's ultimate crisis for faith for the understanding of God but out of that crisis
29:20 -  Equally is the prospect for a deepened revelation of God and deeper foundations of faith Though faith seems like it cannot bear to be stretched
29:32 -  to breaking with what comes with judgment
29:38 -  exile expulsion disaster What is pushed to push to realize that religious belief cannot simply draw on the traditions of the past but must be ready to Resynthesize them creatively and faithfully in order to say yes to a present that is disturbing and a future which is problematic
29:57 -  We're at the verge of sweeping apostasy. In fact in the view of some commentators, it's already with us that there's a daily Loss of faith and The church even in its best forms that they don't
30:13 -  Though they may not even themselves recognize it is moving toward apostasy of moving away from authentic apostolic prophetic faith So and what will happen when when a calamity comes of this proportion that they cannot interpret it rightly understand
30:29 -  It will be like the coup de grace the final thing that blows them away
30:36 -  One is pushed to realize that Religious belief cannot simply draw on the traditions of the past. We're not going to get by in the last days with Schoolroom
30:48 -  Christianity and subscribing to the doctrines of the faith and Evangelical credos of a kind that could have sustained us in a less trying time we're gonna have to have a radical faith for a radical time is what he's saying and
31:02 -  Must be ready to resynthesize and Creatively and faithfully in order to say yes to a present
31:09 -  No, it's to acknowledge that this is coming from God's hand he's sovereign still he's the God of history he's in charge To say yes to a present that is disturbing and a future which is problematic So and I write the whole issue for the church of the last days that will make it either
31:26 -  Apostate or apostolic the issue of apostasy or being apostolic will depend on whether we are able to Use his language Synthesize the faith to find creative ways to understand a
31:41 -  problematic time And be brought into a deeper apprehension of knowledge of God. We fail at that Apostasy is the only alternative
31:51 -  One cannot institution was as final definitive or normative any single perceived pattern of how God works in history Not a remarkable statement When we want to build free booths we want to nail it down
32:06 -  This is the way that God is this is the way I understand them This is the way I expect them to work when all the sudden you're blown out of the saddle God isn't something totally Unexpected in a way that seems even to contradict his own character. How do you how do you follow that? How do you?
32:22 -  So you can't institutionalize God as final or normative And say that this is the only way that he works because to tell God how he works is for you to be above him and To determine who he is
32:35 -  God will never do that Is God going to bring Russian Jews all that way and then allow them to suffer devastation? For you to say what God will do on the basis of the what you understand of the past is to limit God
32:50 -  Or to project a God of your own making that is not God He says events set for theology its task and Refuse to submit to any secure system of interpretation
33:03 -  Know what I would say? Leaving aside the benefits that come to Israel by judgment and restoration
33:10 -  the church needs this we need to come out of our fixed categories and our conventional views however, correct quote-unquote that they are and
33:22 -  Be compelled to re-examine and come into a faith of a real kind That is forced upon us by events So that the judgment coming upon Israel is not only intended for Israel's sake but also for the church
33:40 -  It's a multi-purpose thing like God serving two ends at the same time Which is pictured in the prophet Ezekiel being brought down into the Valley of Dry Bones The hand of the Lord is upon me and he brought me out
33:53 -  out of what out of my conventional categories and Down into a place I would not have chosen to go into the midst of a Valley of Dry Bones and was marched all around and into it
34:05 -  the grit the ugliness of death the Reality that no one wants to see that the flesh shrinks from the face of the prophet is pushed right into it And that's where the chapter begins. It's got to begin with that
34:19 -  Forced to re-examine his faith. Can these bones live son of man? My my old faith is not sufficient for this crisis If you'd ask me an easier thing in keeping with what I understood it would say yes, but this
34:35 -  Explodes what I understand even faith to mean what can even be hoped for in you You've got to give me a larger view of yourself capable of a resurrection from this death and
34:48 -  so God's Is as much concerned with the prophet and the enlargement of his faith and the coming into a fullness Of God's intention as he is with the Dry Bones themselves. There's something
35:02 -  Reciprocal between the church and Israel in the majesty of God Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God that's past finding out And we're going to be called to interpret
35:15 -  These calamities to a church that is going to be knocked for a loop I Will not be able to interpret it in a life-giving way for them unless we have come to that kind of
35:29 -  Real faith in our own experience and that's why God is stretching our categories now knocking us for a loop before the calamity of Israel comes For many of us we're experiencing it personally
35:43 -  There's a wonderful statement than a book by a German theologian Moltmann, what's his first name on the crucified? God probably the greatest Single book that I've read on the crucifixion the theological implications
35:58 -  He says true faith begins with the atheist things that should end namely at the cross in view of a devastated Christ who has failed every hope for That that his disciples had
36:13 -  Remember the two on the road to a mess or lack unless we have thought it had been he who would have restored the good Israel and there he there he is a gangrenous cadaver hanging on the cross a shattered
36:26 -  Piece of humanity absolutely devastated So that's why he says true faith begins with the atheist things that should end true faith begins at the cross In view of the devastation of all that could have been hoped for religiously
36:44 -  And out of that Disappointed hope that was correct in its way and yet not correct enough Comes the true faith true faith
36:55 -  Last day's faith enduring faith overcoming faith begins with the atheist things that should end So that debacle of Israel shattered and cast again into the nations in the last days Will be for many a loss of their inadequate faith
37:13 -  But for a few perhaps the beginning of a true faith when they recognize God in his judgments and the mercies that will follow Events set for theology its task a
37:27 -  remarkable how biblical prophecy Often waits for the event itself
37:35 -  It's present Israel the fulfillment of prophecy Well, what will we believe when present Israel is devastated and and expelled again? Then we need to see prophecy in the light of the event and interpret it anew
37:51 -  So that requires something from us as students not only of the word but of events like the meaning of Their killing of those Muslims in Hebron by a Jewish doctor who is also orthodox
38:06 -  How do we understand that event is it an aberration a freak? Oh thing from a deranged man, or is it a statement of something about a Condition of a nation brought to light by the action of a single man is you representative?
38:22 -  So we're really called to be students of life and the events in history And that refused to submit to any secure system of interpretation It was the devastating impact of the Babylonian exile which first forced them out of what had become an
38:40 -  institutionalized orthodox view of how God acts in history Unlike many people today who are unable to find God in history look for God in nature Jeremiah and Ezekiel broke through to a new vision of God in events
38:55 -  Something happened to the prophets themselves because they looked uncompromisingly without turning away into the fiery the burning bush I Would say for myself my anticipation of Israel's soon-coming devastation
39:11 -  Is not so much exclusively based on What I see in the scripture which seems to confirm it with something intuitive in my own spirit and Something of an understanding of the whole counsel of God and of the faith and of the necessity for judgment
39:31 -  and and and the foundational belief in resurrection and the Understanding that there's no glory except the glory that issues out of life from the death that present Israel cannot
39:43 -  Be the vehicle of God's millennial glory But only something that has first been brought at the death and from death And from death be rate been
39:54 -  raised to be That kind of nation That's not only events
40:00 -  But our whole comprehension of God his way our knowledge of his word in general is his Ways that have been exhibited the understanding that we have out of our own experience of how central Resurrection is in anything that pertains to the glory of God and then this raises the question how then shall Israel be exempt
40:22 -  from the necessity of resurrection If they're elect for that glory and then therefore what will be the death that proceeds? Resurrection if not a soon-coming calamity and then we turn to the scriptures. There's a corroboration
40:39 -  So that says a lot about the prophetic man His constituency his makeup mentality his jealousy for God's glory is understanding of God's work And his own experience of them personally in his own life
40:53 -  It can't be abstract. You know, there's the principle of resurrection. I Mean your community has got to come into death and you're and you're going to be expelled from the very property And it's going to languish in death for three years and you're going to eat and taste that death
41:08 -  It'll be a ghost town in a no-man's land before you're returned again and be sitting in the same buildings But this time with life And prospects of a more significant kind
41:19 -  All of this calamity serves the purpose in requiring us to re-examine our faith and come into more real Appropriation of it and not to say God will not do God devastates us with things that he will do that we cannot explain in what we thought
41:34 -  of God And I wrote here God is not God as he in fact is until man cannot define him Nor is he Lord to we have submitted to him as the indefinable God
41:51 -  This this is my throwing my two cents in Is God really God so long as we're the ones who define him and say what he will do and how he will be but it's a submission to God beyond our definition that really makes him Lord and
42:10 -  This crisis stretches us to that place You know me Or else there's something by them that is called religious by its very nature
42:21 -  That invariably brings us to a place where however correct we are we have God in our box and our definition and our understanding and If and that's so deadly that it would not I would not put it past them to bring
42:36 -  Crisis of an ultimate kind to break that open and stretch us beyond it until we surrender to God Yay, though you slay me though. I don't understand you though. I cannot define you though. You seem to be contradicting yourself Yet are you God and Lord I submit to you as that God that I cannot define and by the way
42:55 -  You're not required to explain yourself to me When he's got us on that ground, he's got us Okay
43:03 -  To think we know when to name God in effect is to have dominion over him just what we're now saying We want the security of knowing over the tension of true faith That's an archaism
43:15 -  We want the security of knowing over the willingness to suffer the tension of true faith to come to the I I am that I am and I will be who I will be and This shall be my name throughout all your generations as a memorial forever
43:32 -  So there's something in us, you know that that wants to To know and to name To think we know and to name God is in effect. I have dominion over him
43:42 -  We want the security of knowing over the tensions of true faith It makes you to understand why The quest for the true faith is lifelong and worth every investment of God that it might be
43:58 -  brought through the fire And as pure as gold everything else can perish But somehow this faith which is to say the knowledge of God as he
44:09 -  End and the object of all things Sort of to allow the word faith to be made hash of or be merchandised in or made a formula for gratifying our carnal lust is
44:23 -  Such a disservice to God is such a disfiguring of a great word and not the least of our prophetic Obligations is to stand as guardians over the great words faith love, you know
44:38 -  righteousness sin judgment because if we lose them or even the words prophet of prophecy and said or apostle apostolic
44:47 -  if that goes into the Waist basket and suffers abuse and loses its real meaning we have lost all But it needs to be a real jealousy for words for these great words and their meanings
45:02 -  And notice how these very words today are suffering a tremendous abuse Misuse they have been cheapened That's something to do with the contending for the faith that was once and for all given the Saints
45:20 -  Hard to imagine that an unbelieving nation can even recognize let alone hear a prophetic call to repentance knowing that the scriptures already described the two prophets the two
45:33 -  anointed sons of oil who testified to the nation for three and a half years and They considered their testimony a torment those who dwell in the earth and celebrate the death of those prophets and and send out gifts to In the Jerusalem which has become the son of the war so it shows a
45:52 -  Degenerating condition in Israel unable to receive God's final witness and in fact the raising of them in resurrection Is the release of the judgments then that fall upon the judge the rejecting the prophet rejecting nation? To reach to reject the prophet is to reject the testimony of Jesus
46:12 -  So that seems to be a picture of a future condition for which Israel progressively is Coming if the church cannot receive the prophetic testimony. How shall we expect it for an unbelieving nation? Nevertheless God senses two witnesses and they may be symptomatic or symbolic of not just two individual men
46:36 -  But again some corporate prophetic expression of a cry of God, you know for a three and a half final Year period and hope that they might be heard but I
46:51 -  Increasingly I've said within the last year on a couple of occasions when I sensed I was Irritating my hearers. I said I'm catching a little glimpse of the experience of those last days two witnesses Who I
47:08 -  Just quoted it Who torment those who dwell here? I feel like I'm tormenting you like you can hardly bear to hear me and
47:17 -  I'm getting a little sense of what of the distaste that might increasingly come for the Prophetic men and the prophetic word my word to you is the torment you would rather not have heard it It's making you uncomfortable and I'm sensing your discomfort and that I'm a tormentor because you're dwelling in the earth
47:41 -  So it's not a happy Premonition of things that are future Even in the church we're going to be a painful discord
47:55 -  it's a rare church that will open itself to the hearing of a word that Challenges it and cause it to some deep and more painful sacrificial place of
48:06 -  consecration and commitment So that has a lot to say, you know, I hope we're not missing these these these reflections on Not only the prophetic call but the prophetic man
48:20 -  If you are thin-skinned and cannot bear to hurt people's feelings or that you should be for them a torment rather than a blessing How will you bring the uncompromising word? It means that God has got this so sift us and deal with us
48:36 -  that we can we can bear to be looked upon in that way by even God's own people and Still bring the word and for that the preparation is extensive and intensive
48:52 -  Later on we will talk about true and false prophets, but right now This often makes this reference Where he says that
49:04 -  the ability of Jeremiah and Ezekiel to consider the issues of restoration right in the midst of judgment is a distinctive of true prophets It is precisely the latent or residual presence of justice and will toward judgment in the midst of unconditional deliverance
49:22 -  Which differentiates the epic of salvation from the shallow grace of false prophecy? This is a long windy Statement, but he's touching something here that will come back to I just want to throw that
49:36 -  Into the midst of a conversation for now, and I'll paraphrase it in my own words It's the grit and the ability to consider Future restoration in the midst of necessary judgment and devastation that distinguishes the true prophet from the false
49:55 -  False prophets have no stomach to consider judgment and their word of Restoration is therefore for false that the true word of restoration
50:08 -  Can only come out of the same one who is willing to submit to the whole council of God? And that this is the difference between The true salvation from the shallow grace of false prophecy and I wrote in parentheses
50:23 -  That's not a in my opinion any grace at all False False prophecy is not a grace
50:29 -  But a deception that could lead to the unpreparedness of saints and their collapse when the unanticipated calamity falls God is triune and composite not only in his persons, but in his acts
50:49 -  That's my statement Could it be that the simplistic and erroneous monotheism Lorded by Judaism
51:00 -  Misses the one because it misses the other You know that you celebrate Shema YIsrael my mother when I drove her home last night sang the Shema YIsrael in the car Because she was stung
51:14 -  By what she was able to pick up in that Bible study hearing Believers speak about the Lord and his acts and his ways If somehow was threatening to her own little notion of Judaism, so she's saying Shema YIsrael
51:30 -  Hero is of the Lord your God is one would If Jews think that they have anything it's this that they are preserving the concept of God as one
51:41 -  Monotheistically, whereas the Christians have disfigured him by making him into three Gods We know that God is a composite Triunity in the fullness of the genius of what God is in his own Godhead and to reduce him to a money
51:59 -  Monotheistic view is to make him something other than what he in fact is So this issue of God in three persons is not just some little doctrinal difference between Christianity and Judaism It's the very issue of God and the knowledge of God
52:13 -  Which by the way was nowhere more radically revealed than at the cross when God and the Sun were suffering on the earth and God and as the father was looking upon and Ordaining that judgment and that it was being performed by the office of the spirit
52:31 -  without spot The sacrifice unto God by the eternal spirit. We have all three persons of the Godhead dramatically and powerfully revealed at the crucifixion
52:43 -  Which we Jews have historically shunted and pushed away from our historical memory and in doing so have lost The view of God as God and are offended that he's a God in three persons and think we're doing him service to hold him as as one Monotheistically now, what am I saying?
53:01 -  That this issue of a triune and composite God is not only revealed in his persons. It's revealed in his acts Could it be that the simplistic erroneous monotheism wrote about you do you use the missus the one because Because we have missed God in his acts his composite acts judgment and mercy. We have missed him in his persons
53:24 -  What of Christians who cannot reconcile the God of judgment and the God of mercy? You know that here there's a certain tradition in Judaism that there are two Messiah's The Messiah that suffers and the Messiah that rules they can't see them both as being one
53:40 -  It's a contradiction in terms and to what degree in our own unconscious Way, do we have our own separate Gods the God of the Old Testament the God of the new the God of judgment? The God of mercy the God who is unspearing the God of love
53:56 -  God is God in his unity not only in his persons, but in his acts So here again in discussing the issue of God's judgments If we have an invitation and an opportunity to see him in his unity
54:12 -  Both in his mercy and in his judgment and if we fail to apprehend that we're not rightly discerning God and
54:22 -  The end you make a God of your own making and in effect are without God Can this view of God that reconciles his judgment with his deliverance be a key also Against last day's deception as well if we're deceived about God in his makeup
54:40 -  To what else will we be subject as deception? So it is an Inextricable connection between one kind of deception and all deception if you miss a
54:57 -  foundation the apprehension of God in his unity in his person in his acts and Have another view that is erroneous and deceptive to what other deceptions will you be liable? How does the prophet go from the proclamation of the one to the proclamation of the other?
55:15 -  Except that his own self is contradicted unto death and only by that death be an oracle unto life. Well I'll take I'll mark that We'll pick up from that point tomorrow
55:28 -  How does the prophet? How is he able to swing from judgment to mercy the God of love and the God of devastation? Without contradicting himself
55:39 -  How do you preach the one thing and prophetic would proclaim the one thing and prophetic claim the other it's schizophrenic I mean, it'll tear you to shreds it's a
55:49 -  And I'm going to I'm a saying Only By that death can he be an article into life
55:56 -  He himself is brought to death in the contradiction of what is required for him to perform And yet the remarkable thing is we're not looking at some Dead men who have no personality no identity where you can't distinguish Ezekiel from Jeremiah and Jeremiah from Haggai and
56:15 -  Or the other prophets they are distinct authentic Authentic personalities they express themselves uniquely. They are formidable men. They are full of men They are prophetic man is ultimate man
56:29 -  Because if the contradictions that they're forced both to see and to express They're brought to a kind of death in themselves and out of that comes the more deformable prophetic life and speaking I'm glad I got it on tape and we're able to come back there tomorrow
56:45 -  So think about this whole thing God and his free persons Not not long ago in a church in Texas
56:54 -  where they're struggling over the issue of a single pastor or a Corporate expression of authority in a plurality of elders Someone was making a case for the single passing of the buck stops here and I heard something just leaked out of my mouth
57:12 -  I said you have a monotheistic view of the church That interesting you see the church only in a
57:22 -  church government only in a singular entity the pastor you do not have a composite view of the authority of the Godhead in the government of God for the church through a plurality of elders of the
57:38 -  inequality and God made that a message and I spoke that as a message the monotheistic verses The triune view of God as reflected even in the issue of church government
57:53 -  so We're on the frontier of things that are all brought to life in
58:00 -  tantalizing rich prospect as we Invest ourselves in the issue of Israel itself the issue of Israel as you may have heard you say Is your issue of the church even its government?
58:13 -  Hallelujah, so Lord We're over our heads with I feel like we're walking like a gangplank over the water and there are sharks looking up at us ready to devour the devour us if we fall in and
58:27 -  Yet, we appreciate Lord the investigation the probing the looking into the fire wanting to understand the deep issues of judgment in which The truest statement of yourself as God is to be found
58:42 -  Thank you for this day my God when we are ceasing from Gratifying our stomachs and our flesh Lord and again. We ask a blessing Because of it all the more
58:56 -  And that you would be with us Lord and the time that is ours that is even available because it's not given over To food its preparation its consumption, and it's cleaning up that we might walk with you in the way talking with one another and Contemplating and meditating upon the things that are being opened
59:15 -  And being brought to that apprehension of yourself for which you wait Sorry, thank you put a seal on this one. Let nothing be lost to those who are hearing from the tape and ourselves
59:27 -  Thank you for this day my God and and what is being unfolded by your grace Receive our gratitude in Jesus name
