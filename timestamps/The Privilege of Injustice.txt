The Privilege of Injustice

00:00 -  Good morning, Precious Saints. What a privilege to be in the House of God with you. I told Pastor I've been a believer for 35 years. I have never observed worship like this. I don't think you have any need of me or my message.
00:38 -  But I would direct you to my morning devotional reading on February 13th, which is Psalm 43. Are you reading the Psalms every day? Really reading? Devotionally? Not as religious obligation?
01:06 -  Of how many chapters you have read? But to luxuriate in the Word, to dwell in the Word. So let's read this short psalm.
01:30 -  Psalm 43 is a cry. It's a cry of a man who is afflicted, a man who is oppressed, a man who is suffering injustice. And that is traditionally the condition of the psalmist.
02:02 -  He's hated by the world, even the religious world. And what he suffers is the result of his relationship with God. He would not have needed to suffer it if he were satisfied with something less.
02:26 -  But the deeper the relationship, the more intimate the knowledge, the greater the suffering. I'm giving a title to my message this morning. I hope you will understand me.
02:50 -  The privilege of injustice. It is a privilege to suffer injustice. If it will bring you to a depth in God, then only it can.
03:15 -  We will praise God for the privilege. We'll listen to this. It begins with the cry of verse one.
03:28 -  Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an unGodly people. Vindicate, justify me. They are deceitful and unjust.
03:50 -  Deliver me. His appeal is not to men, nor to society, nor to government, but to God. You deliver me, because what I'm suffering is because of you.
04:18 -  And I look to you only. Vindicate me, justify me. For you are the God in whom I take refuge.
04:30 -  This is not a mere play on words. This is not religious language. This is heartfelt cry,
04:45 -  directly to God, by a man who will not look to any other source, but to God only.
04:55 -  And if God will not vindicate him, will not answer him, will not defend him,
05:02 -  then he will be defenseless. And he suffers to suffer that, and any benefit that he might have obtained,
05:12 -  if he had turned to man, if he had turned to man. But God does not answer.
05:23 -  And the psalmist cries out in verses, Why have you cast me off? Why must I walk about mournfully,
05:35 -  because of the oppression of the enemy? Why don't you hear me? Why don't you answer immediately?
05:45 -  What kind of God are you? For the issue of what I'm suffering is about you and for you.
05:55 -  Why don't you hurriedly come in my behalf? Why am I mourning? Why do I feel that you have cast me off?
06:09 -  This is painful. This brings our whole faith into question. Where is God?
06:21 -  When we so urgently need him, and have been faithful, and have not turned to another,
06:31 -  he still does not answer. This is typical of the Psalms. The Psalms are God's end time book.
06:47 -  It's instruction for the believers of the last days, who if we are not suffering oppression now, we will then,
07:01 -  and we will cry out to God, and not receive an immediate answer. Doesn't he hear?
07:11 -  Has he not the power to reply? Why does he withhold himself? If you could but understand,
07:22 -  this is very love. Because if he gave you an immediate answer, you would be in spiritual danger
07:37 -  of making Jesus your errand boy. You call the answers. He serves your purposes.
07:48 -  You serve your convenience. Yes, you have received an answer, but you have degraded God.
07:58 -  You have made him less than what he is, because he's not our errand boy. He's not under obligation to answer,
08:10 -  merely because we are hurting. And when he withholds his answer, it's for our sake
08:19 -  that we might really know him as something more than an errand boy, who does our bidding,
08:28 -  for he is God, God Almighty, and we don't know him as we ought.
08:40 -  And oppression and affliction and injustice are a gift from God
08:49 -  to bring us to the knowledge, the true knowledge that cannot be obtained in any other way.
08:59 -  We are privileged to suffer for his name, if that's what our suffering is about.
09:09 -  Not the suffering that follows our stupid sins, but our righteousness is a different kind of suffering.
09:23 -  Why have you cast me off? Oh, in verse 3. Oh, send out your light and your truth.
09:37 -  Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.
09:47 -  Notice what he's asking. Let them lead me. He's not praying that God will lead his oppressor,
10:01 -  bring light to the one who is afflicting him, but let them lead me. Send the light.
10:16 -  And the word send is the great apostolic word. That's what the Greek word apostolos means. Send.
10:35 -  It must be sent from God. It's God's initiative. We have to wait for him to take it.
10:47 -  We cannot compel him, but we can only appeal to him. Send light
10:57 -  for me, not my oppressor. Send light and truth.
11:07 -  Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.
11:26 -  That's an ultimate place. An ultimate place. Have you been there?
11:37 -  The holy hill of God. The very dwelling of the Most High. It's not a place for the curious.
11:53 -  It's not for us to gape at him and stare at him. It's a revelation of God as God in the holy place
12:07 -  when he will give us light to find it in the cry that comes out of our afflictions, not to be saved from it
12:18 -  because it's inconvenient, but to be driven by it by light and truth
12:27 -  into the holy place of God. And there I will go to your altar. Then I will go to the altar of God,
12:37 -  the place of true sacrifice, the place of true worship, and I will praise you,
12:47 -  my God, my exceeding joy. Isn't that a great word? What price tag would you put on it?
13:06 -  How valuable is it to experience the joy of the Lord? Unfamed joy.
13:20 -  It's not something that we can work up. It is something given. It is joy unspeakable.
13:31 -  I am full of glory, few there be who have found it because I have not come
13:43 -  to the place of dwelling to the altar of God my exceeding joy.
14:01 -  There's something so intensely personal about this. That's true of all the Psalms. The Psalms says, my God,
14:14 -  my defense, my strength, my exceeding joy
14:23 -  is mine, is personal. I know it in my deeds because I have been brought there
14:32 -  in the difficulty of my circumstances. I am not turning to man, nor murmuring, nor complaining,
14:42 -  as if it has come from men. When I receive it as privilege, because it brings me to God
14:52 -  who becomes by that my exceeding great joy. We are privileged
15:09 -  to be the afflicted and the oppressed people of God. Not because we're black,
15:19 -  but because we're lovers of God does the world despise us and afflict us
15:30 -  and drive us to him. So the psalmist talks to his own soul in verse 5.
15:43 -  Why I cast down on my soul the soul is the emotions of man the feelings
15:56 -  that always wants to feel sorry for us that always wants to encourage self-pity that always wants to run the show
16:10 -  that wants us to become soulless. But the soul is only one component of man. And his spirit
16:26 -  and God's spirit in his spirit his true being his true identity
16:36 -  what in fact he is in God has got to take authority over himself and address it
16:46 -  and speak to it. I'm not going to allow you that mood I'm not going to allow that mood to swallow me
16:57 -  that's not where I'm living I'm in my spirit and God is in my spirit
17:06 -  so why are you cast down? Why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God
17:15 -  for I shall again praise him and my God. You love that song?
17:28 -  Can you catch the Hebraic flavor of that song? Can you sense the kind of intimate knowledge
17:40 -  that the psalmist has of God? My God my Lord
17:50 -  my help my joy when a man can talk like that
17:59 -  when a woman can talk like that it doesn't matter what the external conditions of the life might be
18:08 -  you've come to something precious something indestructible something the world cannot provide
18:17 -  something enduring my God my strength
18:26 -  my joy I've appropriated something that is life transforming
18:36 -  that I never would have sought I would have been content with less but I was driven to the holy place
18:45 -  by injustice and I cried out to God and gave me life
18:54 -  but not right away that I might melt him and rejoice in him
19:03 -  who is my hope this is the privilege of injustice you have a ministry
19:16 -  to Africa to white Africa that has not had to share your experience
19:31 -  it's a saving message it's a revelation for those who are satisfied
19:41 -  only with religion and even that not to effectually to see an entire people
19:53 -  brought to joy who do not look to men or to society
20:02 -  to right the injustices but to God who vindicates and who justifies
20:12 -  those who look to him exclusively it's something of what the world does not know and cannot know
20:27 -  it cannot be presented to them as a principle it has to be presented to them as a reality demonstrated by an entire people
20:43 -  who are in their midst who have the joy of the Lord not as some kind of cultural thing
20:56 -  or some soullessly prompted thing but as something given by God who waits
21:06 -  for those who will seek him and make him alone their defense who has found him like that
21:18 -  who has the opportunity to find him like that than those who have had the privilege of injustice we don't cry out because
21:33 -  we're suffering inconvenience or someone has more than we have that's not a cry that he will hear
21:45 -  we're suffering because of our faith we're suffering an injustice from the world and trusting God to vindicate us
21:59 -  not for something that's petty and personal to ourselves it's not an issue of creature comfort it's the question of the name of God
22:13 -  and the honor of God as is seen in this people so don't expect an immediate response
22:29 -  and don't be disappointed God is teaching you to wait teaching you to trust
22:42 -  and saving you from minimizing God from demeaning God if he's quick to answer
22:54 -  you'll make of him your errand boy and he waits to be recognized as God
23:08 -  you've been waiting a long time and I trust you're waiting for this this is historic
23:21 -  this is God's answer for the entire nation for the entire continent
23:32 -  that the issue is God not to be submitted as a Sunday religion but as the God who desires to be our exceeding great joy
23:49 -  oh for the people that can demonstrate that not when they're sailing along beautifully but in the midst of their affliction
24:04 -  in the injustice that is not yet made right in that condition when the world expects you to be moaning with self-pity
24:17 -  and nodding your fist at the oppressor you are exhibiting the joy of the Lord he'll send out his light and his truth
24:42 -  not for the oppressor but for you and he will lead you
24:54 -  to the holy place for that is the whole purpose of our human existence it is the whole purpose of nations
25:10 -  it is the whole purpose of history that God might be recognized as God because he has found the people who know him
25:23 -  and it is seen in their joy that no circumstance or situation can dim what is an exceeding great joy
25:38 -  it's the joy of the Lord it's a deep calling unto deep and we will only be brought there by distress
25:58 -  and we will only be brought there by distress he waits to be met there he himself is deep
26:13 -  and he's deep calling unto deep and only distress will bring us there and only distress will bring us there
26:26 -  if it's rightly employed it's a choice of how we will use the circumstances of our life
26:41 -  one choice leads us to despair to anger to hatred, to violence
26:52 -  to alcoholism, to defeat to death and the very same distress can lead a saint to God
27:04 -  to deep calling unto deep for the joy of the Lord it may take circumstance
27:15 -  but you choose your response to it and in that choosing you are made a person
27:27 -  I don't care what our origins are what education we have had what advantage or disadvantage
27:39 -  the moment of choice when we assert ourselves when we command our soul not to be depressed
27:51 -  when we choose God we have become the men and women of God we have come to a truth in ourselves
28:04 -  a reality in ourselves an ultimate identity beyond race and color
28:15 -  beyond nation and ethnic origin true personality, true selfhood because we have chosen God
28:31 -  every soul is capable of that choice Jesus Christ is a deep calling unto deep God himself has produced the distress
28:50 -  he has employed man but he himself is the author to compel us to God
29:03 -  as a deep unto deep God so we may not be powerful in the world
29:17 -  we may not have prestige in the world we may not have influence but we have an ultimate power
29:30 -  that even the wealthy do not enjoy is an ultimate power over our own soul
29:41 -  to command it why are you cast down why are you depressed
29:53 -  why have you allowed circumstances to affect you I command you I command a person to love
30:04 -  he does all things well he is perfect in all his ways and a person who has authority over his own soul
30:16 -  is a person in authority that even the powers of darkness are required to respect what a privilege we have
30:28 -  in our relationship with God to establish these things by our choice
30:45 -  so hope in God are you going to be the songists of your own generation are you sweet singers of Israel
31:03 -  or are you victims murmuring and complaining about the injustices that are in the world
31:14 -  or have you employed them recognize them as given by God
31:26 -  to bring you to a place in the knowledge of him of which the world knows nothing does not even know that such a place is possible
31:38 -  is occupied with the world and will perish until there are people in their midst
31:50 -  who will demonstrate authentically the joy of the Lord
32:02 -  no matter what circumstance God has taken initiative and by that light we will find the holy place
32:13 -  find God as the deep under deep as our refuge, our strength
32:25 -  our exceeding great joy that's the purpose for your existence that's why God has made you black
32:36 -  and sent you in the midst of this continent to have a ministry and a calling as an entire people
32:48 -  to demonstrate God not as meant to be a Sunday supplement but as he in fact is
32:59 -  the living God the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob the God of our fathers
33:11 -  the God who sent Jesus the God who is our exceeding great joy
33:23 -  only distress will bring you there that's why I have called this message given me this morning
33:34 -  for you, the privilege of injustice are you willing for it? really? would you rather have these circumstances improved?
33:48 -  that you could be happy? take your choice brought by physical improvement
34:00 -  or joy brought by distress this joy is worth everything
34:19 -  it is everything there is nothing higher nothing greater
34:30 -  no experience more to be desired more life sustaining, more enduring more encouraging, more strengthening
34:42 -  more witness than the joy of the Lord my God, my exceeding great joy is the statement of the psalmist
34:53 -  who has come to it through suffering that he has made himself a candidate to receive he's not making the best of a bad thing
35:05 -  he has opened himself to the bad thing that he might know God and carry that knowledge into eternity
35:16 -  for that's the purpose of this life to come to such a knowledge such a relationship, such a service
35:28 -  that will carry into the life to come you are a message you're a testimony
35:40 -  you're a statement from God to the world that is dying in its BMWs, in its Mercedes Benz
35:51 -  in its barricaded houses in its barricaded houses because they don't know God
36:03 -  they're satisfied with a Sunday supplement but they're joyless because they have not made him their hope
36:14 -  because their souls are writing them they have not seen an alternative as God intends them
36:26 -  through you talk about an answer for Africa it doesn't need a program
36:40 -  it doesn't need a humanly contrived political solution it needs a demonstration that only a psalmist can make
36:52 -  only a sweet singer of Israel can make who knows God is a deep unto deep because he has sent light
37:04 -  and truth to bring you to his altar to find him in a new way deeper than what we have known
37:15 -  that he might be now actually so what will you allow him to do? I have no pause
37:34 -  what will you allow him to do? how far are you willing to go with God? the Sunday enjoyment?
37:52 -  or the one in whom you live and will even have your day? willing for anything that comes from his hand? and interpreting your circumstances
38:08 -  by the eye of the spirit as not coming from man but from God
38:20 -  not once in this song do we hear complaint do we hear the psalmist saying God let them have it
38:33 -  do they hear? it's only a prayer for himself bring light and truth into my life
38:45 -  that I might find you and know you unto joy unspeakable and full of glory
38:57 -  full of glory it's your joy unspeakable is the mists
39:08 -  but it's his glory he will be glorified by your joy before the face of all nations
39:20 -  because they cannot expect it they only know happiness which fades away
39:31 -  it lasts but a moment but they don't know joy to see your joy is to see God's glory
39:43 -  and that is the purpose for our existence are you praising God for it? are you choosing to be chosen?
39:58 -  my brother introduced me as an American speaker I'm no more American than the man in the moon I have his passport
40:14 -  I have a passport for the American passport I'm living within its boundaries but I'm a man from heaven
40:28 -  a Jewish man saved by the God of Israel can I pray for you?
40:45 -  I'm in a new dimension with God my prayers are becoming authoritative it's not religious human well wishing
41:02 -  it establishes something it becomes an event are you willing for a prayer like that?
41:15 -  are you choosing affliction? are you counting yourself privileged? the Lord
41:31 -  presses God on high the only true and living God whose eye of compassion looks upon this affliction
41:43 -  and sees the suffering everywhere not only by those who are down and out but those who are up and out
41:54 -  they are still out they have not seen, they have not heard they do not know what is available
42:06 -  in the race of the people who know you as deep unto the earth in the midst of their difficulty
42:19 -  and their distress they look to you and their cry be directed to you
42:30 -  exclusively as the God who will give answer not the relief of the condition
42:42 -  the revelation of God from the holy place and full of glory
42:53 -  bless this Africa by this people in this faith
43:05 -  for we have come to a crisis that only this demonstration can answer the knowledge of God
43:16 -  who is our exceeding great joy and our eternal reward in this life
43:28 -  and in the life to come bless this people by their willful choosing
43:40 -  to be the people of God that they might make him known as he deserves to be known
43:51 -  and as you know him because he has not been demonstrated by people who enjoy in him
44:03 -  in their every circumstance I bless this people bless this word
44:14 -  bless this word, this message let it not fall to the ground let it not be just a Sunday in passing
44:26 -  a visiting speaker a little unusual perception let it be the word of the Lord
44:37 -  whose time has come an appointed word for a people and a place
44:49 -  an historic word whose time has come sent from heaven
45:01 -  sent, sent, sent bless you word to this people and this people to their nation
45:12 -  and this nation to this continent and God might be God over all
45:24 -  the God of the solace the God of Israel amen
45:49 -  hallelujah I believe God has not do it by no God has spoken to us
46:01 -  not suffer to be able to to be left
46:12 -  for what it does to us let's give Jesus a hand our answer has come
46:31 -  our breakthrough has come let's give Jesus a hand let it not fall to the ground
46:45 -  let it not be just a Sunday in passing a visiting speaker the Lord

48:28 -  injustice hallelujah thank you
48:40 -  the Lord in the name of Jesus we thank you
48:52 -  we thank you we thank you we give you praise
49:04 -  shall we pray for ourselves? maybe you will be treated unfairly there is a lot of injustice
49:18 -  and like the sound is here pray for himself just for one minute
49:32 -  the situation that we are in living people who are guilty and bad things that have happened to you
49:45 -  don't cry pray for yourself so that God will strengthen you
49:57 -  thank you
