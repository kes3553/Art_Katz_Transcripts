The Powers of the Air 2

00:00 -  I just want to put that on record because God is wanting that quality of praise from you. God has called us to more than just casual pew sitting and a succession of Sunday services. The other example is intercession but intercession
00:22 -  of such a kind and I praise God for every individual who's called to the ministry of intercession. I'm alive because of these precious women. They might even be interceding tonight. I prayed that they would, that we would
00:36 -  have a heaven that would be open above us and that the Word of God would go out unrestrictedly. But there's yet a more powerful kind of intercession and that's the kind that's corporate. And if you read the book Reese Howell's Intercessor
00:51 -  you know that the outcome of World War II was affected by a small band of Saints in England who fought a battle in the air in intercessory prayer to affect actual events in the war that turned the tide against Hitler and
01:11 -  eventuated in the Allied victory. One was when England was hanging on the ropes and all that was needed was an invasion of England. It would have been out of the war and we would have had no springboard for the invasion, the Allied invasion of
01:28 -  the continent. But instead of invading England which every military logic pointed to, Hitler despite the counsel of his own military advisors and generals invaded Russia and it was the beginning of the end for the Nazi cause. Why?
01:45 -  Because a small prayer group in England appropriating and apprehending the mind of the Lord and his wisdom and stratagem interceded and prayed that deception on that man to turn the course of events and the whole course of the war. We are
02:08 -  in a position to affect history. We need not be the hapless victims of circumstance. We need to recognize the operation of the enemy and to receive the direction of God given only together and to pray it into being as reality by
02:33 -  a people who were so disciplined and so unified and so one that if any one of Rieshauer's prayer band so much as began to pray an individual kind of prayer he would immediately rebuke them and tell that person hey that's for your prayer
02:45 -  and there wouldn't be any embarrassment because they had come to such a quality of relationship and reality together. I want to go on record tonight to say that I believe that the quality of our prayer will never exceed the quality of our
03:03 -  relationship together. The kind of prayer that is going to affect the powers of the air that will influence history, change the course of things, break the power, make the powers to release their grip will not exceed the quality of the
03:25 -  relationship of those who are praying together and that then allows me to share with you how the Lord showed me this in our community how we have daily morning prayer meetings for foremost and first activity of the day no matter
03:39 -  what our physical need and we came together one morning and I felt very hungover I felt just heavy and oppressed I thought well it's me you know melancholy Jewish personality but you know what the advantage of community is you have access to each
03:56 -  other's lives you don't have to suffer your individual complaint by yourself and unto yourself and think that it's just you when you can find out because of the frequency of your life together that the other brother is also feeling
04:08 -  oppressed and this sister and in fact the whole community is feeling it and that someone reminded us well how come you know that this is the time that the Chippewa Indians are having their powwow just a few miles away and we
04:21 -  realized that through that powwow that so-called Indian culture there was a greater release of the influence of the powers of the air that we could actually feel the oppression where we were when we began to pray and at first it was the
04:37 -  kind of prayer that saints make you know dutiful obligatory but we realized there was really a war on and we got with it if you had walked into that trailer ten minutes later you would have thought it was an insane asylum you would have
04:50 -  seen people in such postures of prayer stretched out on their faces groaning or people flailing with their arms as if they were in a boxing match standing sitting lying it didn't matter not one was self-conscious of how he or she
05:04 -  appeared to the other we had been together too long we had been through too much to have any concern for proprietor how we would appear we were wrestling and as we wrestled I saw the grimacing ugly countenance of the
05:21 -  symbolic prince of the air that has presided in unbroken domination over northern Minnesota to bring to bring such a toll of death to Indians who never lived to get through their adolescence who get wiped out by drugs
05:38 -  or by alcohol or are smashed in car wrecks drunken in their driving or kill one another the reaper taking his toll who is a destroyer and a mora of men because of that a church to make him persist and
05:53 -  to cease and as you're praying I saw that ugly countenance looking at us with a smirk from the idiot ah he said that that Israel community they're just a pile of problems no sweat but as the crescendo of our prayer rose the
06:09 -  ringing power and authority of our prayer Jesus I know and Paul I know hey and I think I better know this Ben Israel community too because this is more than just religious obligation there's a quality here that is
06:25 -  unmistakably authentic and that's the only thing that the powers of the air are required to acknowledge and that will move them is authenticity in the church and if the church is not authentic what is it and we expect
06:45 -  authenticity in the world of deception and appearances but the church that is the ground and pillar of truth and speaks the loving truth and exhorts one another daily while it is yet today that kind of a people are candidates for
07:05 -  both authentic praise and authentic prayer I watched that smirk wipe off the face of that demonic visage and I watched a trembling lip and a faltering step as you began to back up as we pressed in we were really wrestling by
07:22 -  the way any athletes here can tell you that wrestling as the Greeks knew is ultimate confrontation you can play any other sport yes it's demanding you've got to be in shape but wrestling is beyond even the issue of physical
07:40 -  ability it's beyond the issue of mere strength it's beyond the issue of muscle power it's the issue of grit it's the issue of tenacity it's the issue of your fiber when you're locked eyeball to eyeball and the difference of winning
07:57 -  or losing with an opponent who equals you in physical strength are those intangible qualities of character that enable you to persevere and to endure and not to yield until the victory is won I want to ask you pastors and
08:14 -  ministers and leaders and elders and deacons in this congregation tonight are you seeing to it that your people are in that kind of an environment and receiving that kind of word and that kind of challenge as to form this kind
08:29 -  of character there's a war on folks and we better recognize it for we wrestle and there came a point where I watched this thing just break in fear and take off in panic and we didn't stop praying we continued to pursue in the realm of
08:49 -  spirit hey listen you guys anybody got a straight jacket here am I going to be carted out of this room tonight somebody gonna call for neighbors like this speaker has really flipped out he's gone off the deep end or is he
08:58 -  describing what is most eminently real and have we determined that this is the reality to which our lives are called and they were not to be seduced by these by the appearance of things that is everywhere about us in the beguiling and
09:18 -  tranquil environment of Raleigh Durham North Carolina that says with every breath of every palpitation and every shopping mall and every beautiful living quarter that this is the best of all possible worlds and that church is only
09:31 -  a Sunday institution and that we should enjoy the services and that's the sum all of the deal of what the faith is is that it or have we determined by a willful immersion of ourselves in the apostolic scriptures that there is a war
09:49 -  that there is a conflict between powers that the issue is the whole issue of mankind and the nations and the earth that God has made to a power that is bent upon its destruction and its perverse twisting and distortion and
10:06 -  mind who has already taken such toll that rivers of blood have flowed by wars racial and national that it has inculcated by breathing upon nations in their pride and their nationalism and their racial consciousness every kind
10:24 -  of thing that makes men to act in the wisdom of the world and the Gods of this world rather than in the wisdom of God maybe you can turn with me to Ephesians 3 just to see how well you're being fitted and prepared for the purposes
10:43 -  for which you were saved this is a remarkable book this Ephesians it's so remarkable so lofty we think it's just Paul carry away in a flight of fancy that he's just using a kind of special hyperbolic exaggerated language that in
11:01 -  fact he does not really mean what he says but I want you to believe he means every single syllable and he talks about himself in his calling as a minister in the seventh verse of chapter 3 of the gift of the grace of God given to me by
11:18 -  the effective working of his power to me who I'm less than the least of all the Saints this grace was given that I should preach among the Gentiles in searchable riches of Christ and to make all people see what is the fellowship of
11:31 -  the mystery which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers
11:46 -  in the heavenly places I'm not going to determine my conduct tonight before you by the by the seeing of my natural eye because of it if that was so I would sit down now I'm going to go on by the spirit I don't care if you look the
12:05 -  teeth I'm gonna give you your own I don't care if you think that it's irrelevant God wants something spoken something proclaimed a word gone out into the foundation of the church and into the very earth itself for the
12:23 -  now and I believe that our now has come the manifold wisdom of God might be made known through the church the only agency by which it can be made known and we need to ask a church of what kind social casual a church whose congregation is
12:47 -  only the casual aggregate of individualities how you doing see you next week is that the church is gonna make the manifold wisdom of God known to the principalities and powers of the air
13:01 -  there's scowling defiant scummy and the staple forces of darkness that hate God and hate God's way and hate God's people are they going to be impressed by aggregates of individualities that are irons unto themselves we wrestle the
13:20 -  weapons of our warfare and I don't think that will ever wrestle successfully so long as we're going to continents a church that is white on the one side and black on the other it's we it's our something I'm getting a Holy Ghost chill
13:40 -  right now let's say you just touched it because that's the very area in which the powers of the air have prevailed through fear through jerking through manipulation through intimidation through threat you can't do this this
13:55 -  will happen you don't dare risk this how will it look look at the past look at history God is calling for something transcendent that is beyond fear of which the world knows nothing and until it's demonstrated we have no credibility with
14:15 -  the powers who has scoffed and disdained us until now to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known what is the manifold wisdom of God I've been describing what is the manifold wisdom
14:33 -  of the powers of the air it's a whole totally different value system it's predicated on totally other assumptions on another kind of view it celebrates force violence threat intimidation terror it seduces men by appealing to
14:52 -  lust and prestige and power and wealth what then is the antithesis what is the wisdom of God that God is waiting to be made manifest through the church the very same wisdom and only the wisdom that was demonstrated at the cross by
15:12 -  Jesus Christ himself the wisdom that suffers as a lamb going to the slaughter that is silent that does not seek to defend its own interest that does not respond in kind against evil that prays for its enemies that says late not
15:29 -  destined to their charge father forgive them for they know not what they do if you guys can receive my fancy vocabulary there are two ends I want to deposit in your consciousness that at the cross was a final and ultimate showdown between
15:45 -  these two cosmic wisdoms the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the powers of darkness meekness of upended and assaulted by violence the violence does even now be exerted in iron curtain cells where the Saints are tortured and
16:08 -  threatened if only they'll say uncle if only they'll show that they're fearful for their own lives if only they'll break and crack just like any other man and show that they do not have a certain residue of something and a
16:24 -  conference in a God who is invisible and eternal and that because of him and seeing the eternal weight of glory they can suffer this present affliction as being light and momentary you can't read about the torture of Christians in
16:45 -  and think that that is only political opposition that is the powers of the air who have become so dominant to those that have yielded themselves to the influence that they have that they were to bring the power of the wisdom which
17:04 -  is torture and threat and intimidation and violence right against the bodies of the Saints it's an ultimate confrontation as it was to Jesus ultimate and utter malignity evil meets utter magnanimity the grace of God the
17:23 -  meekness of God the love of God the long-suffering of God that can even love and forgive and pray for those who are afflicting it what shall we say who grow indignant as someone stubs our toes how shall we come to that transcendent
17:45 -  place that through the church the manifold wisdom of God is to be made known to the principalities and powers of the air why is it even important to God and this is the demonstration world without end throughout all ages it's
18:00 -  beyond the issues of the earth it's beyond the issue of how our salvation affects us or our society or a kingdom come even in the earth it's a demonstration to the powers of the air and it says in the very next verse
18:13 -  according to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord we are never going to come into these realities until we have deeply taken into ourselves what is the eternal purpose of the church we need to
18:36 -  understand that there's a satisfaction that God is wanting that has to do with our salvation that goes beyond the things that pertain to ourselves he wants to demonstrate something through the church that is made up of the
18:51 -  the Paul Gordon's and the former hippies and drug addicts and and seducers and and those who live for the essential delight and and tremble for their own advancement and for their own egotism and were afraid of suffering and pain
19:05 -  and wanted only pleasure gratification and make of them an eternal demonstration for the powers of the air that by the grace of God by the disciplines of God by the realities worked into us through true church we
19:22 -  stand as an eternal evidence of a people who in their ultimate confrontation with the powers of the air have reacted and responded is that exactly as Jesus did at the beginning when he made of them an open spoiler we have to complete
19:41 -  what he began by the same demonstration and it is coming when Satan sees a church that is determined to fulfill its eternal destiny and to be a people of this kind of stature and authenticity what do you think he's going to do
20:01 -  we're going to experience the jazz the oppressions the persecutions the circumstantial oppression and things waxing worse by which he thinks to defeat us and to reveal that our profession of the faith is only verbal and hollow and
20:19 -  phony and that will cry uncle if we are only seriously beset upon and the very design to trip us is the very means by which we move from faith to faith in glory to glory we need now rightly to interpret what a stuffed pillow means we
20:41 -  need now to cherish these circumstances of our lives against which we were murmuring that were hard or difficult or demanding not recognizing that God is even now by those circumstances trying to teach us the wisdom of his patience of
20:59 -  his meekness of his self denial the cross needs not only to be proclaimed but demonstrated in the reality of our lives and in any locality where there's a church that gives that authentic demonstration over it the powers of the
21:17 -  air have been broken disrupted and moved aside why is it that it's so difficult to proclaim the gospel why is it that men are so resistant why is it that our labors are so meager in result and fruitfulness because we have been acting
21:36 -  horizontally and laterally not recognizing that there's something vertical that needs to be dealt with that releases men to hear and to respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ
21:49 -  a theologian wrote to whom I'm indebted for the beginning of the opening of my understanding on the subject if you want to make a note I think I'll put it on the tape so you can come to it Hendrik Berghoff a Dutch theologian and the
22:02 -  book is called Christ and the powers just a little inchy-tinky paperback but it is loaded it's the book that the German theologians wouldn't consider before World War two now they're willing to consider he writes any resistance and
22:21 -  every attack against the Gods of this age will be unfruitful unless the church herself is resistance and attack until she demonstrates in her life and fellowship how men can live freed from the powers that is to say without fear
22:41 -  without anxiety without apprehension without trembling a church that can say as Jesus before it the prince of this world comes but he has nothing in me as you can look at the catalogs and go through the malls and see this
22:59 -  plentiferous merchandise and you don't palpitate and I own it at all having food and raining you'll learn therein to be content you're not just by strings you're not moved by that wisdom your very presence a presence of such a
23:18 -  people who have come to that compels the powers of the air to be broken from the orbits and to be moved away that there might be an open heaven over our communities an end to child molestation and rape and racial violence and every
23:36 -  kind of filth and muck that the powers exult in and have had free sway in until as a church in the myth who could call their bluff and say you're defeated you're this arm you're powerless we refuse to give you free sway in our
23:53 -  community your pornography will see a church that can demonstrate it is free from the powers that jerk and manipulate men everywhere how do we come to that kind of church is the question before the church and its leaders and
24:16 -  servants in this community and Sicily is the issue of the mafia but what's the issue here I've already hinted at some portion of it but every community has its own distinctive network of powers and confederation of demons based on
24:37 -  the history and what has come before and what characterizes that locality the test of our maturity is the ability to discern that invisible stratum and also therefore to oppose it we wrestle the weapons of our warfare will never come
25:02 -  to this maturity of the sermon or operation so long as we remain only casually related so long as we are fixed in our own selfishness so long as we tremble over our own security so long as we think that the determinants of our
25:18 -  well-being is the rise and fall of the stock market or the economy or any such thing until we can come to the place where we can we can say you have no power except that be given you from above we need to be free and we need to
25:36 -  be joyfully free and that true freedom needs to be reflected in our praise and that praise will pierce the heavens Jesus beat the devil's worst by presenting God's best at the cross he
25:58 -  disarmed but he didn't eradicate the enemy it's for us to complete that triumph by the demonstration of the very same wisdom I wrote here something happens when meekness and humility meets utter viciousness a demonstration of the
26:18 -  manifold wisdom of God that these powers are obliged to recognize for nothing else can impress them than the very nature of God the holiness of this character exhibited under extreme duress and pressure as only suffering in extremity
26:33 -  can reveal it you can almost say that suffering reveals and ultimate suffering reveals openly that's what happened at the cross the deepest and truest character of God was revealed in Jesus in his suffering and his patient response
26:52 -  to his afflictions when the powers of the air had unparalleled sway to do with him in the triumph at the cross the triumph in that place and it's also the place of our triumph how foolish we are that the very things which we have
27:12 -  complained about in the church namely the trials and the irritations that come to us from the same is exactly the provision of God for the shaping of his Godly character in us to move us to that ultimate place of response by which we
27:28 -  reveal the manifold wisdom of God and it says that posters he's created all things in order that's in the church come on guys you really believe that he created all things the universe the galaxies the earth its seasons the
27:48 -  vegetation food human beings societies nations institutions of culture to assist life that he created all things in order that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated principality of the powers
28:07 -  of the earth and they purpose this eternally in Christ Jesus you believe that are you staggered by that and you understand that that something is so important to God as an eternal eternal demonstration to the praise of his glory
28:28 -  that he has created all things in order that through the church my God on any definition of the church that has restricted it and reduced it to something less than this eternal glory and we shall not rise to it we shall not
28:48 -  become this we shall not suffer when only suffering can teach and establish impatience and then character as the ultimate demonstration except we are seized by the apostolic vision of a God who has created all things order that
29:05 -  through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated to the principalities and powers of the air that has so long mocked God you served God disdain God sought to win the allegiance from the oil came and worship of men to
29:23 -  as Gods waiting for one thing and he's created all things for the church I want you to leave tonight with a new respect a new esteem a new devotion to the church of Jesus Christ and rolling through a look at my it is a genius of God it is
29:46 -  the purpose of God it is the glory of God and such a church is going to take more than Sundays and midweek Bible studies when you give yourself to it for his sake according to the attorney purpose which he purpose and
30:06 -  accomplished in Christ Jesus all Lord this is a three-day seminar not a one night shot at it but I'll take what I can get and I'm going to pray now that something much more than this thumbnail sketch is going to be registered on your
30:26 -  students you're going to become students you're going to search out the subject you're going to look for this literature you're going to ask for revelation and understanding you're going to begin to squint and recognize
30:41 -  the operation of these powers in ways that they were that were previously disguised to you I cannot stand a high school graduation ceremony I cannot stand the so-called patriotic messages from the veterans of foreign wars and
30:57 -  the gratuities and the little things that are given and over the nicety nice and how we're preparing you for life when I know it's a lie it's a deception it's a fraud it's a cop-out it's an institutional gimmick it's a
31:13 -  self-perpetuating system that really has not educated men has not open to them the nature and the reality of the life that is before them and yet we flash our flashbulbs and we buy our gifts and we celebrate and condone and
31:29 -  affirm that lie not recognizing that their powers and operate through it and want to continue their manipulation want to continue their false values want to continue their lies want to continue their deception I want to pray now and
31:48 -  a church is going to rise up and listen that will see apostolic way and deal authoritatively with these powers that have so long victimized men and crushed the image of God in them sold them down the river kept them from the full
32:09 -  openness of God's image in them and from the knowledge in the relationship with God and had them palpitating and powering before the false Gods of this age if only they'll get a raise if only they'll get a date if only to get
32:24 -  someone to sleep with you're going to get a fix jerk manipulated terrorized threatened moved by the powers of the air for false values because of the church was not called and has pronounced the victory of Jesus Christ in this
32:45 -  locality and has demonstrated by the authenticity of their life together let's pray thank you Lord precious God we ask your power tonight love to break false my Jewish people are a historic illustration of the celebration of a
33:10 -  false religion and all of their intense Jewish loyalty for Judaism that has kept them ironically from the knowledge of their God and we steps have patted them on the back and loved and articulated by their religious culture not
33:28 -  recognizing that that's exactly the solace means by which men are everywhere kept in bondage we ask your blessing tonight look and Lord I pray that your word shall not go forward that something has been sown in the foundation of the
33:47 -  church here and in individual lives that we might actually constitute for us a coming of age a dawning of maturity a recognition that our church is more than the succession of happy Sunday services but is the preparation for a combat
34:05 -  award and eventual and ultimate triumph I shall redound to the praise of his glory by God may eternity come to our consciousness may we may we break the power of time may we see the thing that is eternal and fit ourselves for it and
34:26 -  by such a being be made more valid in our own generation Lord I pray for authority in the church discernment in the church even the recognition that individual deliverances is not the issue the real issue of demon spirits it's
34:44 -  peripheral the real issue they are the powers that have found nations and compelled them to war against each other and has destroyed and marred that is even now sweeping through our houses and making fathers to lie with their own
35:02 -  daughters perversion destruction corruption everything against the order of God bring us of age my God bring us to this bring us to the your God bring us to the praise bring us to the intercession bring us to the prayer may
35:20 -  we find each other in a new way may we look for opportunities to be together more frequently and more significantly more intensely than what was known before may we not be satisfied with the
35:31 -  backslash of how you're doing good and think that that is the description of Christian fellowship may we find the koinonia of the church that will not allow any one of us to go in once and not allow society to do it may we be the
35:45 -  church that cares the church that loves the church that is a church that wrestles seal your word tonight maybe an historic word maybe a pivotal word that has turned something for the history of the church my God in this region that
36:02 -  will have effect and consequence in this generation and in the ages to come world without end eternally for Jesus and for his name sake we pray and God's people said Amen
