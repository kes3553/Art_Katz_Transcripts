Gleanings from Psalm 37 2 of 2

00:00 -  and so on top of everything else it's an acrostic poem and now you say well why would God bother to see that the first word of each of each verse follows the order of the alphabet I don't know except maybe that's the way in which the
00:18 -  Israelites memorized the Psalms they remembered that this is an alphabetical order if they could get the first word according to that alphabet then they would get the rest of the verse which would if that's true and God was wanting
00:31 -  this as the most profound and elementary foundational understanding to be communicated to his people that they would memorize it so here's a foundational thing in verse 21 and 22 the wicked borrow and do not pay back
00:48 -  but the righteous are generous and keep on giving that's a characteristic of righteousness they don't wait for repayments for those blessed by the Lord shall inherit the land but those cursed by him shall be cut off and these two
01:03 -  verses we see the dualistic statement of reality that this psalmist perceives the blessed and the cursed the righteous and the wicked falls into a whole way of perceiving and that there's a consequence for righteousness or for
01:22 -  wickedness that results in blessedness or curse being cursed which is deuteronomic this is a this is the this is a kind of view of reality one would obtain by being steeped in the book of Deuteronomy the book of Deuteronomy from
01:39 -  beginning to end is filled with acts and their consequences this is what will be fall the righteous and the faithful this will be the experience of the wicked and warnings to avoid the one and to pursue the other so that the psalmist himself
01:53 -  is steeped in the law L O R A as well as A O W of the tradition of Israel as it was given by God Israel is a study because it's the only nation that has had an explicit foundation laid for it by God through their messengers through
02:13 -  Moses through the law through the prophets through the psalmists this is a way of life invest in the people a heavenly mode of existence given to an appointed nation that they in turn should demonstrate it before all the
02:26 -  nations that all the nations might come to their God this is why it's such a precious object of study it's not that we are have a quaint interest in Israel because they're an ethnic people with an interesting background history they are
02:43 -  the textbook God's intended textbook for all nations and especially for the church that is called to be the continuation of their Israelite faith so this is a Deuteronomic sense of blessing and curse the wicked the righteous these
03:01 -  are the only two categories and in fact when their age ends the book of Revelation seems to indicate that that the wicked are those who dwell in the earth the righteousness are drawn from all of the four corners of heaven does
03:14 -  that mean their physical location there's earthlings and those who dwell in heaven they all occupy the same earth together but they occupy it differently cut them you don't understand that okay yeah those whose hearts fail them for
03:33 -  fear fail them for the things that are coming upon the earth they're rooted in the earth they are earthlings who dwell in the earth they are the unrighteous but those that are heavenly minded as Paul and have their citizenship in heaven
03:49 -  and who see the things that are eternal but invisible live differently and are even the object of the bitterness of those who are earth dwellers it's like a conflict between the heavenly minded and the those who are occupied at the level
04:04 -  of the earth now when the smoke clears at the end of the age there's nothing else but these two classes that the neutral are going to be moved or forced to the one radical alternative than the other so when a judge God's judgment
04:17 -  comes it falls upon those who remain in the earth as earthlings but they don't inherit it those that inherit will be the heavenly people of God and their righteousness will then pervade the earth the right to live in the earth and
04:34 -  dwell in the earth is reserved for the righteous and it will be given them as an inheritance that even when Abraham was in the land of promise it was for him a strange place he walked through it as a stranger because it was not yet the
04:48 -  Cairo's time when it would be the inheritance that would come after with his resurrection so resurrection our confidence in our belief that we will be raised from our death let the world pulverize us take our heads off with the
05:05 -  guillotine or demolish us so we whatever the form God is jealous over every molecule yeah and he will restore it all in a glorified body and we will recognize each other you'll not see art with his gut hanging over his belt that
05:21 -  I'll be slim we will have the about we will have the body appropriate to what we are in I'm sometimes embarrassed to look in the mirror look what page is doing but the body that we will inhabit gloriously and eternally I believe is
05:40 -  appropriate to where we are inwardly and spiritually and we'll know each other how is it that the free that that Jesus took to the mouth of transfiguration that they saw Elijah and Moses conversing with Jesus about this demise did they
05:54 -  have a sign around in there this is Elijah this is Moses because what was visible in the glorified bodies was what what these men quintessentially were as God had finished with them and formed them eternally as masterpieces of his
06:12 -  sanctifying work so this do this matrix I'm getting fancy here the psalmist speaks out of a deuteronomic understanding of reality that he himself has gotten out of the Old Testament but he's reflecting it now poetically but
06:30 -  his understanding is formed and predicated on Deuteronomy that's the Hebrew faith and that faith is completely at odds with the understanding of men in society like for example to convince Jews now that they have that
06:50 -  they are culpable and guilty with their nation that they were brought under a covenantal requirement before God made by their fathers and the fact that they were born in modern times they were not there at Sinai to give ascent to that
07:04 -  covenant does not exempt them they are under obligation to be fulfillers of that common though they were born after the time and that they are identified with the sins of their fathers who have failed in it and God waits for that
07:18 -  this sense of culpability and identity with your nation for sins that took place before your time is completely at odds with the modern what's the word juridical sense of personal responsibility for person for guilt but
07:34 -  it's a biblical view it's a deuteronomic view and it's God's view men will be held accountable for it whether they subscribe to it or not and part of our responsibility as the church especially toward Israel is to persuade it that
07:49 -  this is God's view and that they will be held liable that ignorance of the covenant does not exempt you from its requirements of dressing or curse that's one of the important statements made in that Holocaust book and it's going to
08:05 -  move people to indignation they are going to rail against that and foam at the mouth because it's contrary to the popular and modern concept that you're only responsible for your own acts that says no Israel is a nation and you are
08:20 -  in that identification and you're responsible and in continuation with the sins of your fathers until you acknowledge those sins and repent of them because I think in Leviticus it says explicitly when you will
08:35 -  acknowledge the sins of your fathers and that the judgments with which I have judged them were righteous then I will honor or remember the covenant with you and that you will know God and so on and then blessings will flow something's
08:48 -  required that is outside the modern mentality of contemporary people but it is foundationally biblical and we are a people called to live by that and to make that known you shall be witnesses unto me is more than stuffing a
09:03 -  scripture verse in the pocket of the Jewish waiter as he bends over your table in Israel which I've seen people go I went to Israel I witnessed the Jews I put a scripture verse in the man's pocket as he bent over but I left one in
09:16 -  the telephone booth hoping that someone will find it you shall be witnesses unto me is invitation tomorrow it's the forfeiting of the crucified Christ that has left the people Israel without any knowledge either of sin or judgment or
09:33 -  of the mercy of God because and then what in that one act of Jesus is willing suffering unto death is the whole demonstration of God as God is and man as man is both the nature of sin and the requirement of a righteous God to
09:49 -  expiate it by the shedding of his own blood which is the expression of his mercy so in one demonstration we have both sin judgment and mercy demonstrated but if we refuse that demonstration and say well this was only
10:02 -  a political usurper who acted unwisely and looked upon his head the wrath of the Romans we missed the whole thing entirely and therefore we set in motion circumstances by which we will ultimately be the victim of that lack of
10:17 -  understanding because that would have convicted us and proved that there's no man good nor not good that Jesus was suffering and dying for the sins of all men everywhere and at all times and did not see that is to leave
10:33 -  us with a view of man that is not God's view that man is somehow good and is being made progressively better this is a humanistic notion of man completely at odds with the biblical view at which God says there's no man good no not one if
10:48 -  God were to mark iniquity who can stand so we have a choice before us modern man has a choice his subjective persuasion of his own virtue as many Jews have told me I've never killed anyone my mother will tell me that but
11:03 -  it's not an issue whether you've killed anyone who you're capable of killing whom you've killed with your mouth what murders you performed in your spirit what adulteries you performed in your imagination your unwillingness to see
11:15 -  Christ crucified is to get you off the hook in terms of the indictment that stands against you according to the word of God faith is believing God's statement as against any subjective impression to the contrary God says I'm
11:29 -  a sinner I don't feel that way it's like what you does their self-exalting their self-congratulatory they believe themselves to be the great gift to mankind but what does God's word say and it's on the basis of God's word which is
11:42 -  God's view that men will be held eternally accountable before him we have the obligation to persuade men of that truth though it's totally contrary to their whole subjective view of themselves in a reality of the world we
11:58 -  have an insane view to to commend to men it's an invitation to disaster and the only thing that can give it any enablement is that God says that this view is the power of God itself this gospel is the power of God unto
12:17 -  this ridiculously contradictory view that is so offensive to human sensibility human intelligence is itself the power of God don't look for an intellectually credible statement you're not going to get it this is going to be a piece of
12:29 -  foolishness that God lay aside his feet he came down to earth was born in a virgin lived in a stable lived the life of insignificance and three and a half years had a public ministry died on the cross as a criminal is is the Messiah of
12:43 -  Israel and very God I'm not giving you a credible story to tell I'm giving you one that is calculated to be offensive to human sensibility human understanding and human intelligence and you have got the faith to believe that though it's
12:58 -  going to be mortifying to speak that to an intelligent you that when you will speak it it will be power to bring conviction unto salvation and men will either say with trembling having heard it what must we do to be saved or cast
13:14 -  you out and cast you over the brow of a hill you'll either experience a persecution or the gratitude of men who are safe right but there'll be no middle ground and that this issue is more than just individual salvation it's
13:26 -  the redemption of a nation because God's made a promise to its fathers and his patriarchs that they would be a nation of priests the light into the world that bless all the families of the earth their salvation is the issue of nations
13:40 -  it's the end of murder and mayhem and rape and incest and and schools shootings and every vulgar obscene thing that is distorting reality so it's more than just the issue of even a soul being saved it's a nation being restored but
13:58 -  would we have the courage and the conviction that these views so contrary to my understanding are the views of God and that we can commend them to men as being the very foundation of reality itself remember they said about Paul
14:13 -  much learning have made him mad they threw dust up on their heads they vowed not to eat until this man was dead he's not fit to live he's he's insane he's taking us away from our traditions and what we've understood about Judaism and
14:30 -  he's calling us to something so totally opposite to what we've understood because he claims we've had a vision on the way to Damascus he's not fit to live he's a threat to all that we understand and that's why the wicked persecute the
14:43 -  Lexus they're a threat they're an intimidation they're an indictment that if they didn't exist they could get a get by with it okay our steps are made firm by the Lord verse 23 when he delights in our way though we stumble we
15:00 -  shall not fall headlong for the Lord holds us by the hand our steps are made firm that will stumble though we walk through the valley of death you know we fear no evil but the Lord is my shepherd that means he guides me but I pass also
15:17 -  through the valley of death what kind of guidance is that what this is it this sounds like utter contradiction of paradox and it is it's the paradox of the faith you'll see many scriptures of that paradoxical in yesterday's book of
15:31 -  Proverbs chapter 26 it says don't don't don't instruct the fool he'll only you know spit it out at you the very next verses except that you instruct the fool they come on that Lord make up your mind you know what is it the one thing or the
15:45 -  other it's both things our faith is paradoxical and if we have not a taste for the paradoxical for the contradictory we'll be offended by it so we have to roll with the punches God says this but he says also that give me
16:00 -  grace when we become inducted into the paradoxes of God what is implied is that reality is too rich and too complex to reduce to formulas that we have to make allowance even what seems to be contradiction you don't have learned of
16:18 -  what seems to be paradoxical and contradictory if I persist waiting on the Lord or pressing for for his revelation that when it comes it's the deepest revelation of what would otherwise be lost and once we get a taste for that
16:32 -  we will look at each other differently this is what I want to say we will have an ability to bear one another in a way that will not require member the spirit of requirement that you've got to be this you've got to be that how come
16:44 -  there's a much greater liberality and allowance for each other because we recognize we can't reduce men to a formula or to a principle it's too they're too rich the two variable we don't know their whole history so or
16:57 -  their future it would result in an attitude of much greater patience and forbearance with one another once we have been inducted into the paradoxical truths of God it's the religionist who's pharisaical who's got it all nailed down
17:11 -  who's condemning if there's any deviance from what he thinks ought to be proper behavior but one who senses the paradoxical truth of God the seeming contradictions is also affected in the way to relate to his own brother in a
17:26 -  much more patient and forbearing way than would otherwise be so this is it this is the consequence of coming back into the truth of God as doctrine but the spirit of that truth imagine reducing this glorious faith into some
17:40 -  predictable Sunday service mentality that you know what's going to come and there's the program when you come into the building that this glory the richness of it the texture the reality has somehow been reduced to a
17:53 -  predictable formula and we call that Christianity what whatever what should we say like a slight against God but this could be reduced to that kind of the thing as a Sunday addendum this is too glorious just to get again to the
18:09 -  part of this how can we resolve that our steps are made firm by the Lord and yet somehow within those steps there's the possibility that we can stumble but when we stumble it's not going to be fatal we'll not stumble headlong so as to break
18:24 -  our next but maybe that stumbling is instructive maybe it would save us from an arrogance of a walk that was so impeccable that we think ourselves the supreme saint and would look at others as being of a lesser kind if it has no
18:38 -  other function but that it's worth it and David had to stumble and stumble grievously but somehow God was in those steps it's not that we are absolved from our stumbling as if well he made me do it but somehow the God who directs our
18:53 -  steps allows for a stumbling in those steps that is salutary and healthy and needful and can we receive that but will not will not rush headlong it'll not be a full disaster because the Lord is all the while holding us by the hand come on
19:11 -  look I know you're far too busy you've got end-time purposes to fulfill I'm just Joe Blow you're holding me by the hand you've got that kind of intimate direct patient relationship and with every saint at the same time you have
19:26 -  to mastermind the entire economy of God and bring it to fruition yes it talk about the knowledge of God that's the breaks your heart that God could be taken up with his ultimate purposes that you think would fully occupy him and yet
19:40 -  involved in detail with the life of every individual saint even to plot and to prepare and to fit them for stumbling because stumbling will serve the purposes of God as well as walking correctly in the path of righteousness
19:56 -  talk about being led talk about exquisite provision from God talk about love wow I mean if I'm a little bit put out but having to be this all the time for my mother and how come you're not here it's what it's tempted told you
20:12 -  should you know what a statement of God's patient for them right wouldn't we be astonished to learn that Paul's whole understanding of that was drawn from the songs that what he would he later expressed apostolic Lee had his
20:29 -  formation in his life as a Jew who was immersed in the Psalms it gave him a breadth of understanding that he later exemplified him and addressed to believers of all generations so much was he steeped in these realities okay well
20:48 -  what do you do with verse 31 30 31 the mouth of the righteous mouths of the righteous are the wisdom that time speak justice the world God is in their hearts their steps do not slip talk about paradox we've just learned that we're
21:01 -  almost inevitably going to stumble this let's let's do not slip that their stumbling is not a slip yeah it's somehow a preordained design in the wisdom of God to humble us and to show us that we're never in a place that we
21:15 -  think ourselves absolute that we have arrived that this these are the ordained steps of God that the slipping is a step so the same psalmist says elsewhere in the 22nd psalm the Lord is my shepherd his staff and his rod they
21:31 -  comfort me that wherever it guides and leads me I know it's good maybe just the last few verses from 37 to the end of the psalm mark the blindness behold the upright for there is posterity for the peaceable no God is so opposed to
21:47 -  violence I told the Muslim I said the very fact that you justify the use of violence is ipso facto conclusive proof that the God whom you celebrate is not God Wow Mike and the God who is God does not employ violence he despises violence
22:08 -  violence is the final act of men who are Godless and when they will exercise it in the name of God you see the most grievous betrayal of God even the church in the slaughter of its own innocent than the modest who burned at the stake
22:23 -  in the name of God the terrible contradiction of God he's peace he's the prince of peace he abhors violence if there's one thing that frightens me about the Israel is that there would ever be an eruption that would result in violence
22:35 -  oh like the grounds would be desecrated we would have to tear our clothing and fill dust in our heads and call the fast that that's something violent has erupted here and invaded and affected the atmosphere that God has established a
22:51 -  holy investment it's a parent they say self-generated or demonically generated physical act by which one inflicts himself upon another I can't stand graffiti one of the most painful things in this last triple disease was to see
23:14 -  the graffiti sprawled out on buildings and what was formerly East Germany and that the buildings had never been touched or repaired through the whole of the communist regime are now in places of restoration some of you have seen
23:28 -  those photographs and here's these buildings newly plastered over and beautiful new facade and and all over it as far as hands can reach are these big painted grip the ugly graffiti more graffiti is painting on buildings words
23:44 -  and your club name or whatever did and you know the remarkable thing is is the similarity in all of the graffiti it's as if they went to the same school to learn how to do it but what it is is that they would check they were motivated
23:57 -  by the same spirit and the thing that kills me is how dare anyone dispoiled a piece of property that is not his own how dare anyone dispoiled a piece of property but to think that you have the liberty to take someone else's
24:14 -  property and to desecrate it is an act of violence and they'll not take long before you go from the graffiti on buildings to destroying them does not take long before you burn books before you burn them and so Nazi Germany is it
24:31 -  is a textbook case for us of men who have allowed that in fact Hitler came to power through violence they became such a terror this Nazi party and Hitler youth that they intimidated their political opposition and if they couldn't they
24:46 -  would kill them graffiti is violence so we need to know that violence but let's try and define this it more often than not it is a physical act that has consequence for those of whom it's inflicted but it's a kind of rupture
25:02 -  it's a kind of violence against the laws of God and of nature it's controverting the justice and equity and beauty of the Lord it's it's doing damage to his nature it's interesting that the judgment of God is upon those
25:17 -  who spoil the earth you ever see that because I think it's in Revelation those who have spoiled the earth that's why David could not stretch forth his hand against so though he was a great warrior what's the spirit of violence what's the
25:29 -  anatomy of violence we had a dictionary looked it up and show the etymology of the word how is it broken down does it have a Latin root so that that kind of thing is very illuminating that's why a Christian should not be about a
25:41 -  dictionary remember where Paul says in first Corinthians the two men going to result believers resolve the difference going to the world's court better to allow yourself to be defrauded better to lose what is at stake here then to
25:56 -  rupture something by the violence of a court and their decision of unregenerate men so the way of peace well this is something to contemplate the Prince of peace the shalom of God what is that it's more than the absence of force it's
26:16 -  a presence it's a way that is that out of the very heart of God he abhors violence he's the God of peace and not in some kind of cheaply way in which somehow the issue is made a non-issue the issue is seen through those that
26:31 -  speak the truth in love establish the church the church and maturity and righteousness the study God who sweeps things on the table quite the contrary he still has a controversy with Israel he still has issues that they have not
26:46 -  yet heard or answered he still has the indictment against them by the prophets who whom he raised up early and sent to them day in and day out so he's not one who sweeps the issues under the carpet but he confronts us with issues in order
27:00 -  that we might come to a true resolution that is peace which is the piece of righteousness the fruit of righteousness is peace and if there's going to be an atmosphere that exudes the shalom of God it's not because we have avoided
27:16 -  physical conflict it's because the place and its life is established in the righteousness of God peace is not a cheaply violence is the impatience of men here's a definition right up ahead the violence is the impatience of men to
27:32 -  obtain an end that that procures the satisfaction without looking to God so that's what war is between nations and the heck of it is that their ministers bless them and send them with with the blessing of their God as if what they're
27:47 -  doing with some kind of a holy Christian and God condemns violence except the violence that takes the kingdom what kind of violence is that this is this is hyperbolic language hyperbole h-y-p-e-r-b-o-l-e what does it mean exaggerated like the use of language to
28:06 -  speak in an exaggerated way in order to make a telling point that God would use violence with in connection with the kingdom of God has got to arrest your attention and only the violent take the kingdom what does that mean well it's certainly not going to be the the fruit of the
28:24 -  indifferent because the kingdom of God is antithetical to the kingdoms of this world it's going to be in a disjuncture and attention opposition against the wisdom of this world so to desire that kind of life and that reality in that kingdom and to seek to it requires a
28:41 -  certain violence a certain intensity of spirit a certain willingness for sacrifice of pulling out the stops so that often when i'm speaking at churches my my invitation at the end is how far are you willing to go with God or you think you've gone far have you gone to the farthest
28:57 -  are you willing to pull out the spouse at every last reservation how far are you willing to go well really what i'm saying is how violent are you wanting to be it's one kind of a determination to be evangelistic and most of the normal activities of the church but in this final
29:12 -  and ultimate conflict against the principalities and the powers of the air something is required beyond that and he calls it an utterness toward God and that that phrase has stuck in my spirit again it's not a thing that will be explained by running to a dictionary this is utterness
29:32 -  we don't even have the word we don't use the word in our conversation utterly something utter utterness is something to the very extremity there's nothing beyond that it's at the perimeter it borders on insanity this utterness
29:48 -  i love for example the scene in hamlet you know this play by shakespeare where ophelia his love commits suicide while he's away she's a tortured and disturbed girl and he comes back in time for her funeral and you remember the the the guy is digging her grave the gravedigger and finds the
30:08 -  skull of the old court jester and hamlet not knowing for whom the grave is yet dug speaks in his philosophical way oh i mean i forgot the name of this jester where are your jibes and your and your jokes now not you reduced to this then he finds out and then he's hardly
30:26 -  finished with this soliloquy this statement when he sees the funeral session and all of a sudden realizes that the one is going to be buried is the woman whom he loves died by her own suicide suicide and they came to mourn at the grave but he leaps into the grave
30:45 -  he says your mourning your sorrow is kiddy stuff my anguish of soul requires me to leap into the grave it's a it's an act of utterness that makes hamlet hamlet and it's the quality that God looks for in his people that will distinguish the kingdom of God and obtain it we are much too casual
31:09 -  one day for us is like another we don't know what sacrifice really means and therefore the kingdom does not come and washman knee was right the last day's battles what is before us will not be met no one except by those who have an utterness toward God and will pull out all the
31:28 -  stops so but the wickedness and the violence of transgressions of the of the transgressions of violence of the wicked will be all together destroyed and even the apostasy shall be cut off those that are descendants will suffer for that as well in verse 38 but the salvation of the
31:48 -  righteous is from the lord he is their refuge in the time of trouble which implies that they're not exempt from such a time and that in fact their trouble is the very consequence of their walk they would not be experiencing this trouble if they were lackadaisical everyday saints they
32:05 -  would not be bothered it's because they are saints of this kind who have pulled out the stops and have this utterness toward God that marks them before the powers of the air as ones to be opposed the trouble comes not because of their indifference but because of their dedication
32:21 -  God does not say that you're going to be absolved from it in fact he says the ones is quite the contrary that this kingdom will not come except with how does he say it the frank would notice in this in this in this life you will have persecution you will have it's the name name
32:41 -  of the game not a consequence of your sin but the consequence of your righteousness before God but he is their refuge in that time of trouble now that is mind-boggling how does an indivisible God become an actual place of refuge this is more than metaphor this is more than
33:02 -  poetry he's talking about something absolutely substantial and actual which will be the preserving of body and soul in time of trouble if we have come to a relationship with God relationship with God that we can come into him where he himself constitutes the refuge not
33:18 -  his provision not a building not a community not a place in the country but he himself is the refuge only for a psalmist who has come into this kind of relationship and so God is showing us that there's a place that we would not have thought available that the psalmist has found
33:39 -  that the righteous of all ages have found and that will be available to us also but the time of trouble is certainly before us the lord helps them and rescues them he rescues them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in him God is actual he's more than a pious
33:59 -  abstraction he himself is a fortress and a refuge and my rock these are the way the psalmist speak because they're not just being poetic this is the most definitive statement of what is the foundational reality of their life God has become this and that's what is before us as a last day's
34:21 -  provision he helps them and rescues them he's not a far off he's an intervening God that comes into your situation in his own time and will bring this resolution what a Goddess is who takes us by the hand and intervenes and comes in to help and to rescue
34:42 -  and if i know anything about him it will be at the last moment but i mean the last moment the very last moment just about when you're ready to expire and throw in the towel and this is hopeless and where is he just as you're sinking then he shows himself in the dawn after the great
35:04 -  darkness and even despair in him what you know what there's no one that uses that phrase more than Paul in him in him i move and live and have my name in christ in in in that's got to be more than some kind of poetic fancy or use of words in a figurative way but that there's a literal
35:25 -  actual way of being in God it's one thing to be near him to sense his presence and i'm always a little bit disturbed when i hear believers talking about if God will do this for me or give me a help then i will do as if there are two entities ourselves and God separate from and
35:45 -  distant from each other but to be in him is to dissolve one of the two entities namely ourselves to be in God is to say that you can't tell where you end and he has begun that for you to live is christ and that christ is indestructible he's a place of safety and refuge
36:07 -  because what can touch him he's very God and he has more than any other tasted death for every man and defeated death through death so what can the enemy bring that can anyway intimidate or threaten God i don't know of a safer place than the God who has himself passed through death
36:26 -  and his life forever more but the question the issue is how to be how to believe come in him are we content to be alongside him is there something about preserving our own independent identity that keeps us from this union that we actually prefer to be helped by God rather than
36:46 -  to be in God because if we still exist and have our own identity and do for God then we're the object of the attention of others we can receive compliments and we kind of enjoy doing for God but to be in God means that that personality no longer is he prefers to be dissolved and not have
37:08 -  a status and identity independent from another than God that the lord might be all in all and Jesus himself comes to that place i think in first corinthians 15 that in the end that he gives over the kingdoms to the father that that that the father is all in all and Jesus has even
37:30 -  given over his own distinction and identity that the father might be supreme and lord over all what a final statement from the lord even after his resurrection and ascension what a statement from the father that he gave to the son a name above every other name that can be named that
37:49 -  there's no name that can be named that is greater than the name of Jesus that the father was willing to be to defer to the son and give him an honor that he should reserve only for himself and that the final act of the son is to give over the kingdoms of this world which he has obtained
38:05 -  through the church and give it to the father that the father might be all in all what are we seeing from the Godhead itself a willingness to give up even their essential identity and that we are called to that but as you know from reading the book reality it's one thing for a sheep to be slaughtered
38:25 -  and it's another thing for a pig remember that how we learned right out here for all of the alticles that i've seen or given myself when i saw the way that sheep went to its death you didn't hear a peep it went quietly to its slaughter but the pig hanging up from its fine clips was squealing
38:44 -  you never heard more ungainly unearthly demonic shrieks and cries coming out of a piece of protoplasm that came out of that pig and the brother put the knife right in it and it still continued to howl and finally when that thing was blood drained and was finally dead i know it's
39:01 -  going to die harder we opened it up and when the guy had plunged in the knife was right in the heart the heart had been perforated by that thrust and the pig still was squealing so does protoplasm at even that level have such a determination to preserve its own existence and identity so show
39:20 -  me the saints who are going to make an alticle and give God their all without squealing and shrieking and howling and digging in their feet i don't believe it we're not in him because we still want to maintain our separate distinct identities we want to be used by the lord we
39:38 -  want to be blessed by the lord employed by the lord but we don't want the lord to be all in all we want to cut a little swath also it's something like what adam said of the conflict that came to him in these days when he realized God's preeminent intention for Israel that Israel is going to be
39:53 -  the first and foremost of nations and receive such a glory and honor and a new name and he said but well what about me what about the church what about the eldest son who didn't want to see this lavish display for the younger because he was did not know that the father had little things
40:11 -  there's something in us that wants a place and that's why we don't see the resurrected christ as often as we want we see men of accomplishment and we're impressed by them and a measure blessed by them but it's another thing to hear the lord see the lord and know that what we're hearing and
40:34 -  receiving is not the man but a life in and through the man that is not his own because whatever was in that man has been given all the under death and the lord will test that and prove whose life it is that is being lived Paul is a glory Paul is an apostolic masterpiece
40:57 -  not because of anything in him that's jewish or distinctive or intellectual or courageous it's because he surrendered every one of those attributes unto death and counted it as down he despised it that he might win christ and what we have in Paul is nothing less no other than the
41:14 -  continuation of the lord and therefore there's no man in the in the new testament who uses the phrase more frequently than Paul in him in him in him because Paul was in him Paul is Jesus Paul is the resurrected continuation of that life and that's why he's the most formidable of all
41:34 -  apostles and that what he wrote has become foundational to under testament faith and then where he says i received this by inspiration but another person says but i give you this as an opinion but 2000 years later his opinion has been received as being everything as much as what he
41:50 -  had received from as revelation because Paul's opinions were God's his thoughts were not his thoughts but God's thoughts imagine to come to a place like that do you desire a place like that are you willing for a place like that what happened when the world laid its hands on the holy one of
42:07 -  Israel talk about not being able to bear the words of a prophet they couldn't bear his existence and what they ventilated on him was the fury of violence anger bitterness and wrath that he was marred more than any man he had no beauty nor commonness that we should desire him is not the
42:30 -  statement of Jesus in his natural life it's the statement of Jesus ever has been batted to a pulp by the forces of darkness who hated his guts because the life of God was the life of Jesus what then will be our future no wonder we want to play this game discreetly and not give ourselves
42:49 -  that totality or we will be as much an object of the fury and the hater of the powers of darkness as was Jesus isn't a remarkable thing that we should be led through an examination of an old testament song into the ultimate consideration of new testament truth you think that's accidental
43:10 -  i think it's all together appropriate and perfect so i want to conclude with a prayer and read to you what i wrote sometime early this morning while you were turning over on the other side as i was myself reviewing and wrestling with this particular song i wrote these are classic
43:29 -  somic p s a l m i c observation and prescriptions set in as an overview for all of life a prescription of ultimate reality and i wrote how real is it for you cats how much would you desire all this as a predicate of your present life and being how much would i choose to make this
43:53 -  foundational to my own life and continuance in God this is more than a song this is a slice of the reality of God this is ultimate prescription a predicate is something upon which everything else is founded and from which everything issues
44:10 -  just a song song 37 i wonder what something it's going to be 39 102 rich so lord we could not have gotten this from man who from a man who just had a flair for fiction or poetry and knew how to put nice words together this man has learned something at a school of
44:35 -  another kind this knowledge of God is not cheap and it won't be cheap for us my God to enter in and to exhibit also who desire to be the sweet singers of Israel of our own generation and so we thank you my God for this excursion today what a review what a grappling with
44:56 -  fundamental reality as you see it that is so in opposition to the worlds it's another way and lord we have to say that we love this way we delight in this way we want to exhibit this way we ask for grace my God to walk in it take us by the hand even as the son has said and lead us my
45:16 -  God at the paths of righteousness for your name's sake and i ask my God that your indulgence your love to us you you have not withheld a thing you have poured out you have spoken to us like sons and daughters you you've not treated us with kid gloves you've not made this a school that this is
45:33 -  an event my God this is a dealing you've poured your heart out you have to open up our understanding and we only ask that you give us the grace to respond to you in kind and we will not be among those who withhold but that we will come my God to an utterness toward God you'll have us lord that
45:53 -  we can would say in complete truth for us to witness christ we have no separate identity there's nothing that we want to see honored or acknowledged or esteemed by men that if we do anything that you're doing yes even your faith we live by the faith of the son of God and not
46:09 -  even our own faith our own faith is inadequate even to grasp this so lord may you be all in all give us the spirit of Jesus who having suffered all things turns the whole thing over to the father give us the spirit of the father who turns all things over to the son of complete
46:27 -  abandoning of any interest in oneself and everything defers to the other oh may you have a church that is like you my God that will reveal your glory in the earth and we thank you that you've given us a book with words to encourage and to inspire us to this possibility that it's
46:47 -  not abstract it's not hypothetical there's a there's an actual possibility and made possible because you had a son who walked in the fullness of it unto death and has made this tested and approved and ascended life available to every saint who will thank you oh lord grant us the
47:04 -  faith to desire that life above our own and and to give up our filthy rags and our own petty ambitions whatsoever they are that you might be all in all we bless you lord oh that you had this for us today and took reggie to the midgety and that will not be cheated of what will have come
47:21 -  from reggie will still have the benefit in the in the appointed time but this was the appointed time for this word and we receive it my God with gratitude may it constitute an event in our life that will say will mark our bibles this day on august 27th in the reading of the 37th psalm
47:38 -  something happened i transacted with God i i threw in the towel i gave all the
