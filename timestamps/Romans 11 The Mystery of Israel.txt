Romans 11 The Mystery of Israel

00:00 -  Tonight is going to be some treatment of Romans chapter 11. Great, great, great text. And scholars rightly say, of all of Paul's epistles, Romans is the most systematic, most comprehensive, most complete. In other places like Ephesians, Hebrews, he can go off into airy and ethereal heights that are remarkable.
00:30 -  But in Romans, there's a nuts and bolts, intense concentration of Paul in a systematic way, which is not his ordinary course. So I find in my infrequent collisions with those who subscribe to a replacement theory, invariably, they do not refer to Romans. They do not refer to Romans 9-11. They omit chapter 11. They have to. There's no way to include chapter 11 and still dismiss Israel.
01:05 -  So I just want to leap in this to do a real service to the text. We would have to spend a whole camp. But to get the sense and the gist of it, in verse 25, So the first thing to observe is that Paul's statement is about a mystery.
01:54 -  And we need a special appreciation for mysteries, and the sense in which Paul uses the word, and so out of keeping with the modern temper. The modern temper wants detail, understanding, clarity, principles, programs. Paul is speaking of something so deep that it cannot be conveyed as a principle series of statements.
02:22 -  It's a mystery that needs to be more apprehended than anything else. And that's all mysteries must be apprehended. That's why so few understand Israel and the church as mystery. Even those that are sympathetic and disposed can turn this into a program series of principles, statements, and lose the genius of the mystery.
02:48 -  That this is so deep in the heart of God that the only word that could be rightly ascribed to describe it is mystery. And this is the only statement where Paul says, I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery. And then describes a penalty, lest you become wise in your own conceit.
03:08 -  This mystery is of such import, of such a kind, so central to the whole of Paul's apostolic view of the faith. That to miss this mystery is to bring a certain consequence where you necessarily rise in your own conceit. Your own self-adulation, your own inflation, your own leaven, you get puffed up.
03:32 -  You begin to say, God is finished with Israel, we are the Israel of God. You begin to say, the kingdom is not just coming, the kingdom is here and we are that kingdom. Or, we will take over all of the aspects of present society and civilization and Christianize everything.
03:52 -  And by that means, we will establish the kingdom and present it to the Lord when he comes. There's any number of varieties of presumptive statements by people who are suffering the consequence that Paul described. Why is it, he doesn't make this statement with regard to any other mystery but this,
04:11 -  that the omission of this mystery brings this consequence? And more than I can say in the few minutes that is ours tonight, it's because God in his wisdom realized that something about the nature of Israel and the call of the church in regard to it
04:32 -  and the monumental things that hang upon Israel's restoration with regard to his kingdom and coming will necessarily temper any church that can appropriate this mystery and subscribe and submit to it. It has a tempering factor built in by its nature in itself.
04:54 -  Which is to say, if that tempering factor is removed, necessarily we're going to rise in self-inflation as the church and any church that lacks the character of God and meekness has lost its identity as church. So everything hangs on this remarkable mystery.
05:15 -  And this is not an appendix, this is not an asterisk we turn to the back of the book where Paul is giving us an afternote. The scholars say, Romans 9-11 is the centerpiece of Paul's total apostolic mindset. And what precedes the chapters 1-8 are the preliminaries, all precious and important in itself, but to bring us to the commencement in 9.
05:40 -  And what follows 11, 12-16 is the outworking and practical consequence of the receiving of this mystery. We need to see it that way. This is not Paul's afterthought, this is Paul's forethought, this is Paul's central thought. And if that was true for Paul, how true ought it to be for us?
05:58 -  What has been the consequence for the church historically in the omission of this central apostolic understanding? The Lord knows and some of us know and are suffering that omission and the character of the present church, its likeness, its man-centeredness, its CEO, the composition, the quality, the character, the texture, the program,
06:26 -  so much that agitates the sensitive soul that is in anguish for soul, and for some who are unable to come and to attend and be in regular attendance to church in that condition. And the last analysis, I believe that that condition is related to this omission.
06:43 -  This inclusion would have affected everything in another way, as in God's intended way. It's so deep, the magnitude is so rich, so extensive, it not only affects your view of Israel, it affects your view of everything. It communicates the genius of what apostolic is.
07:04 -  It gives the sense of mystery. How can God be known and understood without the sense of the mysteries that issue from him? So, so much is at stake.
07:15 -  I was sharing with a brother before dinner, coming like a snail, I can't explain my mood tonight, who's connected with a well-known international evangelical ministry, which I know does not have this consideration. And yet its primary purpose is the promulgation of the Gospel.
07:38 -  I said, what do they do with Romans 1, 17, is it? Where Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
07:54 -  That is a monumental statement. And here's what we need to know before we go further. Paul is not speaking out of his ethnic identity.
08:04 -  This is not a Jew making a case for his kinsmen, because he has a natural empathy for his own. And that's true for me as well. What comes for me tonight is not out of this identification with Jews as a Jew,
08:19 -  but with the calling that I have in God for the Church. And the same was true for Paul. So, he's not ashamed of the Gospel, why should he say that?
08:29 -  Is there anything about the Gospel that could be shameful? Yes, not only something, everything. Have you realized how absurd a message the Gospel in fact is?
08:41 -  You'll never realize it more than when you confront a Jew with it, particularly a Jew who is well-established and is the man of the year and is culturally and ethically impressive and has university credentials
08:57 -  and in every way is so much more estimable than we, who are plugging our way through and gasping and sucking for air and struggling with our marriages and congregations.
09:09 -  These people seem to have it all together. They are eminently successful, intellectual, cerebral, cultured. Some of them are poor, that's what I represent, my wife says,
09:23 -  of all the Jews I had to get you. Otherwise remarkably successful, so out of proportion to the population. Their attainment of Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes, so out of proportion.
09:39 -  What are they in the population, 1%? But the increase of their global international awards is so off the wall in terms of accomplishment.
09:54 -  You're going to tell that people that their God, Leosite, his deity, came down from heaven and took upon himself the form of a man, who was born as a helpless infant to a virgin, come on,
10:09 -  and lived a life of obscurity and hiddenness for the major part of his life, had only a three and a half year public ministry, which was nationally rejected and ended up executed as a criminal outside the city
10:23 -  between criminals and buried in a borrowed grave. And that's your God and your Messiah. Furthermore, the blood that he shed has an efficacy to cleanse sin 2,000 years later.
10:39 -  Well, you're telling that to a man who has no sin consciousness. In a word, I'm saying this, God has seen to it that his message does not commend itself to human sensibility and consideration.
10:56 -  By its very nature, it's a scandal and it's an offense. And if it has become an easy thing in your mouth and a glib formula, you're not speaking it in the kind of compelling power that penetrates.
11:10 -  You've reduced it to a formula, step one, step two. But the gospel itself, by its nature and God's intention, is an offense and a scandal. And nowhere is that more evident than when you bring it to that people
11:25 -  who are the epitome of human accomplishment, rationality, cerebral intellectual distinction. There's a Hebrew Christian theologian now passed on, Jacob Yosh, J-O-C-Z, who taught at some university seminary in Toronto.
11:49 -  He said, nothing more reveals the radical content of the gospel than proclaiming it to the Jew. And I can tell you out of my own experience. When that door slams in your face and the man is outraged and the mask of civility is removed
12:06 -  and the teeth are bared, you recognize that you're touching a sensitive nerve and that what you're about is so patently offensive. How dare you?
12:21 -  My first contact in Kansas City as a missionary to the Jews trained in New York, sent to Kansas City to represent this mission founded by the rabbi who was converted on the east side of New York hearing the gospel in Yiddish.
12:36 -  So I was trained for a year, sent, I arrive, then what? Well, what do you do now? What program? So I took the dirty wash to the laundromat and didn't know how to operate the machine
12:50 -  and I asked a lady for help and we got into a conversation. She was Jewish. That's the way it begins. And what are you doing here? You've newly arrived in Kansas City? Yes.
12:59 -  Try to explain that you're in Kansas City as a missionary and speak that dread word. To use that word to identify yourself as a missionary is to be dead before you begin. You need to know what the history of Christendom has been toward the Jew.
13:19 -  The expulsion from Spain, the Spanish Inquisition, being burned alive at the stake, torture. What Jews were forced to confess under torture in the Middle Ages, that they were responsible for polluting the wells, poisoning the wells.
13:35 -  How else is the Black Plague to be understood, which took about a third of European life wholesale by the hundreds of thousands in every city and Jews themselves were unscathed?
13:48 -  Well, clearly they must have been the culprits. And so to extract the confession that they were, they would take this one or that and put them under excruciating tortures and obtain it.
14:02 -  And then they would release a vengeful campaign against Jews by which they would die by the hundreds or the thousands by fire, by sword, by every means. Imprisonment, the Crusades.
14:18 -  How did they finance the Crusades? By looting and pillaging Jewish communities throughout Europe. The place where that was my favorite locale in Germany, Esslingen.
14:30 -  I loved that town. I couldn't understand why. And I loved the cobblestone streets, the air, the sense of age, antiquity. It was not bombed in either war, so it retained its medieval character.
14:46 -  And I found out after I left Germany that it was in Esslingen, where the present church now stands, had been the location of the synagogue. And when the Crusaders came through in the 1100s,
14:58 -  the Jews locked themselves up into the synagogue for safety because the threat was convert, be baptized, or die. Well, they chose to die. And they died at their own hand.
15:11 -  You think they're going to welcome the intrusion of these unregenerate characters who will rape as quickly as they will loot and pillage? And your daughter and your wife is going to be submitted to that?
15:23 -  Better that they should die even at your own hand. Kadush Hashem, sanctify the name by a voluntary death rather than a forced conversion. Don't think that we Jews have forgotten this.
15:40 -  It's written right through the whole texture of our history and life. And if we have never studied it, it's in the air. It's in our mother's milk. I knew it before I knew it.
15:50 -  So when I got saved, I knew what my mother was going to say. She would shriek with horror. I had joined the enemy. She still remembered up to her 96th year that as a schoolgirl in London,
16:03 -  she was pushed into the swimming pool by her Gentile Christian teacher because what else can they be but Christians? They're not Muslims, they're Christians.
16:12 -  And was told, sink or swim, you fat Jew. My mother remembered that through her entire life. It affected and toned and colored her every relationship with the Gentile world.
16:25 -  She couldn't go to a supermarket and pass through the checkout counter with a freckle-faced, sandy-haired girl without tensing up and wondering what would she suffer, what slight insult
16:39 -  by those people who have always been the enemy. In a word, you dear saints, I could take the rest of the night and quote, book with me, and you would be shocked by the horror
16:52 -  of Christendom's treatment of Jews through the ages. So I'm saying all that to say this. Not only do we have a difficult message,
17:01 -  not only do we have an obdurate people who have no need of it without any sin consciousness, but we have also to work through the profound prejudice
17:10 -  that attaches itself to the name Jesus Christ and Christendom, the Church. And you're going to promote that. You know how I'm looked upon when I'm in contact with my kinsmen
17:23 -  at a university outreach where Jews are to be found out of proportion to their number in the population? And some will come out of curiosity to hear from a man
17:33 -  who's going to speak on the Gospel or Christianity whose name is Katz. They come armed for bear, and sometimes the invective and the anger is so thick that there's no point in even trying to say anything.
17:50 -  You have to be a pin cushion. You have to receive the anguished pain that has been cumulative through the generations now coming out in a pointed way
18:01 -  to a man who looks like a traitor. How else would a Jew become a Christian and promote that message by which Jews have suffered historically
18:10 -  except he's in it for something? How contentable can a man be? And what do you say to them, Art?
18:18 -  Nothing. What can I say? I have only to absorb the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. That you love us, Katz? Who told you that?
18:27 -  I don't even know it. How do you know it? It wasn't, but a few months later, I was in their synagogue,
18:37 -  770 Eastern Parkway, wearing a black suit, white shirt. I had everything but the beard. And I have now a black fedora.
18:46 -  I have a black overcoat. And I make a pretty presentable Orthodox Jew. Except, and who do I walk into?
18:56 -  This same guy, smack dab in the midst of a thousand men davening, praying, and he looks up, he blinks, what are you doing here?
19:08 -  So, dear saints, it's tough. In fact, it's ultimately tough, even in this text. Paul says in verse 28, as concerning the Gospel,
19:19 -  they are enemies for your sakes. You know what's wrong with Paul? He always tacked on an additional phrase,
19:29 -  where it would have been so much more convenient if he had placed a period there. Then we would have said, yes, they are the enemies of the Gospel.
19:36 -  Then he says, for your sakes. What does he mean by that? Is there some benefit for us in having a people as obdurate
19:48 -  and as resistant and as angry as Jews? And the answer is yes. Because that will test and reveal whether the Gospel
19:59 -  is in fact the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes and to the Jew first. And if we don't know that, if it has not been revealed
20:08 -  with them first, what are we saying to the Greeks after? There's a priority with God that is full of divine wisdom. God doesn't say, oh, you have a new theatrical production?
20:21 -  Well, try it out in the country. Bring it first to Connecticut and Vermont. And then when it's tested, you can bring it to Broadway.
20:29 -  No, the Lord says, begin in Jerusalem and to Judea and to the uttermost, to Samaria, the uttermost quarters of the earth.
20:38 -  You begin where it's toughest. You begin where I was crucified. Begin where the prophets were stoned.
20:44 -  No wonder the disciples locked themselves up in an upper room. Maybe that's why people prefer Jesus on a cross where he can invoke sympathy as the crucified victim
21:00 -  than a cross in which he has departed as resurrected and ascended, whose final words are, all authority is given unto me, both in heaven and earth.
21:10 -  Go ye therefore into all the world and to preach this Gospel to every creature beginning at Jerusalem. There's a remarkable divine wisdom in that requirement.
21:25 -  And I know it better than you all because I know how tough my Jewish people are. I know how tough I was.
21:33 -  You wouldn't dare approach me. I would have breathed flames. And yet, by process of God and the mercy of God
21:41 -  over a course of time comes the revelation in the first reading of the New Testament and a subsequent conversion.
21:49 -  They are the enemies of the Gospel for your sake. But if you don't know them as enemies and you've not experienced their opposition,
21:57 -  their inveterate hatred of the name of Jesus, how then have you received the benefit? And what then are you bringing to Greeks
22:10 -  in a message that has not first been tested and tempered by bringing it to the most difficult people on the face of the earth?
22:20 -  For your sake. And if we don't bring it, if we circumvent them and we don't bring it to them first,
22:26 -  you know what's in the last analysis? We don't bring it to them at all. That's the history indicates.
22:32 -  Jews like myself have not come as the result of the Church's activity. We have come solely and exclusively
22:40 -  by the miraculous acts of God that has apprehended us in the way through dream, through vision, through revelation,
22:49 -  through the prayer usually of some unsung and unknown Christian saint, but not by some program,
22:56 -  some activity of evangelism by the Church itself. So what do we signify? What statement are we making to the principalities
23:05 -  and powers of the air who know the mandate that God has called and given to the Jew first and knows that we have circumvented
23:14 -  that requirement historically? How do they look upon us who have denied the Lord's priority,
23:23 -  which is to deny the Lord, and then come into our services and sing in rapturous terms about the Lord?
23:31 -  They are totally unimpressed and unaffected. That's why they can say, Jesus we know and Paul we know, but who are you?
23:39 -  They know that we have circumvented the priority of God in His mandate and order as Lord, and therefore the ground is out from under us
23:49 -  in any kind of weight and impressiveness that we ought to constitute in the spiritual battle with the heavenlies,
23:58 -  because we have forfeited the word of God as priority given by the Lord. Do you understand that?
24:06 -  There are great issues here, and it's more than just another ministry to another entity, another ethnic people,
24:18 -  no more valid than to the Gypsies or to the Romanians or South Sea Islanders, the Jew also of course, yes,
24:26 -  but not in the priority, in the foremost intention of God before any other, to the Jew first.
24:34 -  That's not to negate other missions and ministries. In fact, we've just read what the incentive is for world mission,
24:45 -  for the fullness of the Gentiles to become in. So then the deliverer comes out of Zion. Here also, in the call of the Church
24:55 -  to other nations and peoples, the underlying and profoundest motive for that outreach is not only
25:02 -  that they should be saved, but that there's a number from every nation for which God waits
25:08 -  when the fullness of the Gentiles become in. Paul doesn't give us detail. There's no asterisk that turns us
25:15 -  to the bottom of the page where he then tells us what he means. But there is a number.
25:21 -  The fullness of the Gentiles is not the nations per se. You know why?
25:26 -  Because the nations per se will be Israel's task after their restoration. But presently the Church's task
25:34 -  is not the nations, but a number from the nations for his namesake,
25:39 -  a number that must be completed. So even the issue of world mission is profoundly centered in the mystery of God
25:48 -  for which he waits that he might turn and be the deliverer that comes out from Zion. You can't turn from it.
25:56 -  Whichever way you look, Paul has boxed us in and made the Jew and the Israel
26:01 -  foremost in every consideration for the fulfillment of all the things that pertain to God, his kingdom, and his glory.
26:08 -  In fact, Paul ends Romans 11 with the most rapturous pain of praise
26:16 -  that eclipses even the Psalmists. Oh, the depth of the riches, the last three verses
26:22 -  that conclude chapter 11. Paul breaks forth. He cannot contain himself.
26:29 -  This is not a man who is given to glib statements or shabby and easy sentiment.
26:34 -  This is not a man that's just fulminating at the soul level. This is a man who has seen something.
26:42 -  He's glimpsed something by virtue of his apostolic office and his union with Christ
26:48 -  of the mystery and its portent, its multi-layered significance that has taken his breath away.
26:56 -  Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God. Who has been his counselor?
27:04 -  Who has given to him? And it shall be given again. For of him and through him and to him
27:09 -  are all things to whom be glory forever. You can just see the man
27:15 -  tottering, reeling like a drunk and collapsing with the conclusion of that statement foaming at the mouth.
27:22 -  The question is, what has he seen that provokes a statement so ecstatic as that?
27:30 -  And why have we not seen it? And until we do, can we come to the place of worship and exaltation
27:39 -  that's worthy of Christ of the kind that he expresses in those concluding verses?
27:45 -  If we've missed the mystery, we've missed the greatest motive and incentive for the recognition
27:51 -  of God and his majesty, his wisdom that is breathtaking and can only be expressed with, oh, oh,
28:00 -  the depth of the riches. When have we said, oh, last? I can make a whole sermon
28:05 -  under the word, oh, like being hit in the solar plexus. The air goes out from it.
28:11 -  Oh, it's not a stylistic device of Paul. He's not being literary. He's gasping, oh, the depth of the riches.
28:21 -  Well, what has he seen? Well, he's seen Israel's restoration, which is mighty, without which
28:28 -  the Davidic king does not come to be seated at Zion. He's waiting for the restored nation
28:33 -  that says, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. So, of course, that's every reason
28:38 -  for gasping, but he's seen something even more, and that's what actually sweeps everything away.
28:46 -  Not only Israel's restoration, but the church's transfiguration and the demand made upon it
28:54 -  in its mandate toward Israel. Israel compels the church in the last analysis to become
29:00 -  the prophetic and apostolic entity for which Paul labors with the Gentiles. Why was he the apostle to the Gentiles?
29:07 -  Exactly for that reason, because the issue of Israel's restoration was not to come from Jews.
29:14 -  It was to come from the activity, the conduct, the prayer, the intercession, the witness, the sacrifice
29:21 -  of a Gentile church. Therefore, he's the apostle to the Gentiles for his kinsmen's sake.
29:30 -  So, a true appreciation of Romans 11 has got to begin with chapter 9, because I just described the ecstatic conclusion,
29:42 -  but we need to see the groan and the cry that commences those three great chapters.
29:52 -  I say the truth in Christ, I lie not. My conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness
29:59 -  and continual sorrow in my heart. We spoke about a place for sorrow and tragedy as not unbecoming to faith.
30:10 -  Continual sorrow, for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen,
30:18 -  according to the flesh. What a cry. There's nothing to which it bears comparison
30:27 -  than the cry of Moses, block me out. If you'll not yet save this people, block me out from your book.
30:34 -  God is ready to make another nation out from Moses exclusively, and Moses says, no.
30:39 -  If you'll not continue with this people, then block me out of your book. And Paul is crying out,
30:46 -  I would wish myself accursed for my kinsmen, my brethren's sake. But listen, you dear saints,
30:51 -  if you say that that is Paul speaking only out of his Jewish ethnic identity with his kinsmen,
30:58 -  you will have missed the whole thing completely. This is not a cry of a Jew. This is the cry of an apostle.
31:07 -  This is an apostolic heart cry. This is an apostolic understanding of what their present condition is
31:16 -  and what God is wanting to complete the age for which He's willing, even for the forfeiture of His own conversion.
31:29 -  If we dismiss this as Paul just speaking and crying out of his own ethnic identity with Jews,
31:36 -  which the Church has done till now, we will have missed it. I'm repeating myself.
31:41 -  This is the depth of his apostolic heart, which is to say the heart of God. This is God's own heart
31:48 -  that sorrows continually for this people which He has chosen. Paul has proximity to that heart.
31:55 -  That's what an apostle is. That's why we cannot bear the false kind, however clever they may be
32:02 -  in mending churches and doing other things and appropriating Paul and sounding like if they do not bring the sense of God as God
32:13 -  and the sense of God's heart as only an apostle can. That's his distinction.
32:21 -  So, what's the significance of this for us? It's this. That we are not absolved
32:28 -  from an attitude of sorrow and concern of an intense kind that must precede any fulfillment on our part
32:37 -  of the mandate to the Jew first. We have got to begin where Paul begins with a deep heart cry and identification
32:45 -  that is not lost to us because we're not Jews, but is available to us to the degree that we are apostolic.
32:54 -  Got the idea? This is an invitation, a necessary one,
33:01 -  if we are to fulfill this remarkable mandate that is so exhaustive and so demanding that Paul himself has to cry,
33:10 -  who is sufficient for these things? This is a difficult, obdurate people, and the history that has taken place
33:17 -  since the time of Paul compounds our difficulty all the more. We had to work through the Holocaust,
33:25 -  through the Crusades, through the Spanish Inquisition, through the burnings at the stake,
33:31 -  through the pogroms in Eastern Europe. In the Ukraine, as late as the 1920s, there was an anti-Semitic outburst
33:39 -  that left tens of thousands of Ukrainian Jews dead in the streets where they were unable to bury their own,
33:46 -  because as they sought to take away the corpse of a family member, they would be killed in the process.
33:52 -  The bodies just lay out there and were eaten by dogs and pigs. In the 1920s,
33:58 -  by the tens of thousands. So, this is deep in Jewish consciousness, but mention the name of Jesus,
34:07 -  or the word Christianity, or the word missionary, and you automatically invoke
34:13 -  such a response of anger that historically is justified. And yet, you have got to speak through that
34:23 -  and communicate somehow that you are not identified with those who have victimized Jews,
34:29 -  that the kind of Christian you are is something else and other than that regenerative thing
34:35 -  that was performed by Catholics at the stake in burning men alive and torturing them in false confessions
34:41 -  and the expulsion from Spain. In Spain, 400,000 had to leave Spain, which had been their home for centuries.
34:50 -  The greatest giants of medicine, philosophy, poetry, art, not art, biblical giants,
34:59 -  had had long tenure in Spain, were required at a certain date to depart. 400,000.
35:08 -  Can you imagine the uprooting? And there is yet going to be uprooting that will eclipse that.
35:14 -  What does that do to the psyche of a people? The trauma. They could not take their property with them,
35:20 -  and they had properties that had to be let go for virtually nothing. They could not take hard currency
35:28 -  in silver or gold. They could only take what was on their backs and maybe a little something of food.
35:34 -  How long will that last? What conditions would they face? Who would take them in?
35:40 -  Yes, for a couple of months, but if they were not out by a certain date in Portugal, every Jew in Portugal
35:46 -  became a slave of the king. Literally, they were sold. It's a horror, saints.
35:56 -  The least we can do is have some cognizance of what that history has been, so that when we approach a Jew,
36:02 -  we know everything is stacked against us. Why does God do that? Why does God allow that?
36:09 -  The restoration of Israel, of a deliverer that must come and take away their transgressions,
36:15 -  is so critical. Why has He allowed conditions to be so compacted
36:21 -  and so unbelievably difficult that they themselves are the enemies of the Gospel
36:27 -  for our sake? It's like ultimate challenge that can only be met
36:33 -  on apostolic ground. You can't succeed in this evangelically. You can't succeed in this
36:39 -  in well-meaning sentimental affection for Jews. As you need the cry
36:45 -  of the apostolic cry of Paul at the outset, you need the apostolic power and authority of Paul
36:51 -  in its fulfillment. So God compels us onto apostolic resurrection
36:59 -  ground. And yet the book of Romans was not some deliberate piece of theology.
37:05 -  It was Paul's practical answer to an essentially Gentile church,
37:11 -  is God finished with the Jews? That's a question that was logical to ask.
37:17 -  They had just crucified in recent history their Messiah. The apostolic church was now being
37:23 -  persecuted by rabbinical Judaism. Wasn't that the evidence that they were
37:29 -  being passed over and had forfeited place in God?
37:35 -  And so the very first verse of chapter 11, Paul takes up the great question, has God
37:41 -  cast away his people? The Roman church believed that by every reckoning he should
37:47 -  have. But there's a difference between human reckoning and divine reckoning. Because human reckoning
37:53 -  is predicated on accomplishment and divine reckoning is predicated on mercy.
37:59 -  How many of us are judgmental toward one another based on our estimation of the
38:05 -  value of a believer in terms of his works or anything that is
38:11 -  impressive and outward, rather than just the genuine, heartfelt identification, compassion
38:17 -  which would be God's. We are more, what's the word, critical,
38:23 -  censorious, determining and estimating the value by what someone
38:29 -  does or what appears to be. God is not that way. He does not dismiss
38:35 -  Israel because of its tragic, apparent and historic failure. In fact, he reminds
38:41 -  Israel that you have blasphemed my name in every nation whereunto I have driven
38:47 -  you. But that's not a ground for your exclusion or for my forfeiting my
38:53 -  covenantal promise to you and my call to you to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world.
38:59 -  For the gifts and callings of God are irrevocable. Where are we told that? In Romans, chapter
39:05 -  11. We need to be told that God is not a man
39:11 -  that he should lie or withdraw his promise or cancel his covenants
39:17 -  even if Israel is unfaithful in its own keeping. And in fact, what comes to Israel in its final
39:23 -  restoration is a new and eternal covenant. Why eternal? Because it will never again
39:29 -  be broken. With a history of covenant unfaithfulness like Israel, how can we
39:35 -  be assured of that? Because God himself in the new covenant will write the law in their
39:41 -  inward parts and in their hearts. He'll see to it that it's not broken by the majesty of his own
39:47 -  grace toward them, totally undeserved. Can you see that because we
39:53 -  have been such a culprit people blaspheming his name, dishonoring him, unfaithful in
39:59 -  covenant, though we have been privileged by deliverance through the Red Sea, by the giving of the law at Sinai, by the giving
40:05 -  of the prophets, by the giving of David, by the giving of the psalmist, yet we make golden calves
40:11 -  and are still capable of that kind of idolatrous sin, though it doesn't take a visible form
40:17 -  as a golden calf. And yet for all that he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy. So Israel,
40:23 -  because of its condition, gives opportunity for God to
40:29 -  reveal himself in an uttermost way, which is to say his mercy.
40:35 -  So what shall you say when he says in the verses with which we began, for this is my
40:41 -  covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins? We ought to be jealous
40:47 -  about God's ability to fulfill his own covenant according to the
40:53 -  things that are written, because the issue of his faithfulness, despite every
40:59 -  inestimable difficulty, is the issue of God. If they are
41:05 -  for us the enemies of the Gospel,
41:11 -  and have been his enemies, so to speak, historically, for him to overrule their unwillingness
41:17 -  even to be a priestly people, whose desire only is to be like other
41:23 -  nations. He has to overrule even their lack of understanding and their lack of desire
41:29 -  to fulfill the things for which they're called. And yet he will succeed, because if he does not,
41:35 -  how then is he God? The issue of Jesus and the issue of God is the issue
41:41 -  of Israel's restoration, despite all of the unbelievable difficulties
41:47 -  that attend that resolution. And to make it yet all the
41:53 -  more difficult, what is his instrument? What is the agency which he chooses
41:59 -  to employ to these great ends? The Church. Isn't that enough
42:05 -  for anyone to despair? To throw in the towel and say, forget it!
42:11 -  Lord, look at the pathetic condition of the Church! They're going to rise to heroic heights of sacrifice?
42:17 -  They're going to bear the indignation and anger of Jews and bring this word to
42:23 -  their consideration? They're going to fulfill the mandate to the Jew first? They're going to extend
42:29 -  mercy that they may receive mercy at a time when to do so is to put your head on the block? No way
42:35 -  unless the Church itself, in the taking of the mandate
42:41 -  seriously, opens the floodgates of grace in order to fulfill it.
42:47 -  And in the process of receiving mercy that they might extend mercy
42:53 -  are themselves transformed in the process and fitted for ruling and reigning with Christ
42:59 -  from the heavenly places. The Jew is our finishing school.
43:05 -  The requirement of disobedience is such a demand that the performance of it, which can only be done
43:11 -  corporately and not by individual virtuoso saints, the Church is compelled to come of age.
43:17 -  It's compelled to come onto apostolic ground. It's compelled to be the sons and daughters of the resurrection
43:23 -  for nothing less nor other will suffice. The Jew compels us. Can you see it? Oh, the
43:29 -  depth of the wisdom, both of the, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge
43:35 -  of God. How is he going to achieve not only Israel's restoration,
43:41 -  but the Church's what's the word, transfiguration from
43:47 -  its present slovenly, melancholy and unhappy condition.
43:55 -  The issue of the Jew compels the Church to a higher ground so that
44:01 -  Israel, even in its unbelief, especially in its unbelief, especially in its apostasy, especially
44:07 -  in its opposition, is a challenge of such a kind that in the meeting of it, the Church must
44:13 -  necessarily become transfigured. In the flight from it and the circumvention
44:19 -  of it, the Church lapses into a condition less than and other than the apostolic
44:25 -  glory of God's intention. For unto him be glory in the Church.
44:31 -  For, of course, this mystery is of him, through him and to him, to whom be glory
44:37 -  forever. The issue is not Israel's restoration. The issue is not even the Church's
44:43 -  transfiguration. The issue, apostolically speaking, for Paul and ought to be for us,
44:49 -  the glory of God forever. Something exceeds and
44:55 -  transcends even Paul's jealousy for the Church, for which he is the key apostle,
45:01 -  the chief apostle, something more than his identification and love for his own people, which is never
45:07 -  lacking or slack, however much they desire his own death and persecute him.
45:13 -  But the great apostolic motive is to realize that God has chosen
45:19 -  in this mystery the means for his eternal glorification. For of him and
45:25 -  through him and to him be glory forever. And I know you,
45:31 -  Australians, and others like you, who are not glory
45:37 -  minded. Neither are you forever minded. You are fixed in time,
45:43 -  in the present moment, in the things that are immediate. You have not an apostolic vista
45:49 -  of the things that lie beyond present moment, history, time, and circumstance and need. You have not
45:55 -  this breadth of understanding, the weight of things, the mystery that has had its
46:01 -  inception since time immemorial and finds its conclusion and climax and consummation at the end of the age
46:07 -  through the Church that God might be glorified forever because there will not
46:13 -  be another occasion. The end of this age and Israel's restoration, when the deliverer comes
46:19 -  out of Zion to take transgression from Jacob, there is no further labor, there is no further
46:25 -  anything to be fulfilled in history. It's the end of history, but it's the beginning of millennial glory.
46:31 -  So there will not be another historic working in which we can participate. This is it.
46:37 -  But it's of such magnitude that it's the issue of his glory forever.
46:43 -  And once you become glory conscious and minded, forever
46:49 -  minded, the issue of eternity begins to come into consideration which is long overdue for us.
46:55 -  It's not something that we can consider after we die. God wants eternal things
47:01 -  factored into our present life and understanding consideration because it affects everything.
47:07 -  To be eternally minded like Paul is to see the things that are invisible and eternal
47:13 -  and the eternal weight of glory that makes his present suffering both momentary and light.
47:19 -  Paul's view of eternity and his attention of it actually affected his present suffering.
47:25 -  He just did not feel it as acutely as those who are fixed in time, place, and body.
47:31 -  He was already in another dimension and it was that that makes him the apostle that he is.
47:37 -  What then will an apostolic church be if he is the foundation? Must it not exhibit
47:45 -  the very same realities that distinguish his life as an apostle?
47:51 -  That begins with a cry and ends with an exclamation. Can you see how far below that condition
47:57 -  we presently are? How then shall we be raised with by taking the mandate
48:03 -  of God not only seriously but as a foremost and first priority to the Jew first?
48:11 -  That's why you were saved. Has God cast away his people?
48:17 -  God forbid. Then he goes on to say, hey, save me. I'm an Israelite.
48:23 -  He's not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Then again the question comes up in verse 11 and he repeats himself. I say then, have they
48:31 -  stumbled that they should fall? Are you getting the point, Roman church? God forbid. As I think I've mentioned
48:37 -  somewhere earlier in these days, when Paul says God forbid, it's not a little reflex action. He's choosing
48:43 -  the deepest Greek expression of an exclamation like don't even begin to consider
48:49 -  that God is finished with them. God forbid that you should even entertain the thought
48:55 -  because if you do you will have dismissed the mystery. The fulfillment of which
49:01 -  God obtains his glory forever. So then God forbid, but rather through their fall,
49:09 -  salvation has come to the Gentiles. If only it put a period there. But no, again,
49:15 -  so as or for to provoke them to jealousy. He will not allow you to
49:23 -  consider your salvation independent of the purpose for which you are saved with regard to this people in this
49:29 -  nation. To enjoy your salvation and that kind of independence is to condemn
49:35 -  yourself to a narrow believism and a shallow evangelicalism that leaves you in
49:41 -  a shabby condition that is so painfully evident everywhere in the world and the Church as it is
49:47 -  lamentably today. The absence of this consideration has depleted the Church.
49:53 -  It must be reckoned in fact, we're saved for a purpose beyond ourselves because
49:59 -  if we have not a purpose beyond ourselves and our salvation, how are we saved? How are we
50:05 -  saved from egocentric concern that used to be expressed
50:11 -  conally in the world and now is expressed religiously or spiritually in the Church? How was the meeting?
50:17 -  How did you like the speaker? Did you enjoy this? Did you enjoy that? Everything is predicated on us.
50:23 -  Our likes, our dislikes, did you wish that still that center that false center remains
50:29 -  even among converted people who are spirit filled until the one thing
50:35 -  is taken into deepest consciousness and consideration that alone has the power to break
50:41 -  this egocentrism that will not yield to anything other than this mandate to move
50:47 -  them to jealousy. And what a request, what a requirement that is. What will it take?
50:53 -  Our impressive song service? Impressive preaching? They do better without
50:59 -  the Holy Spirit than we do with, so to speak, if you've attended services.
51:05 -  They have Hebrew liturgy. They have eloquent rabbis. They have the
51:11 -  language itself. They have the Psalms. They have remarkable assets that eclipse
51:17 -  even our charismatic equivalent. So it's not going to be church services.
51:23 -  And Paul doesn't say what it's going to be. We have to find out what it is
51:29 -  that will move them to jealousy. And it will not begin to catch a glimpse of God's intention until
51:35 -  he sees we have taken the mandate seriously and intend to fulfill it. And we begin to seek his face.
51:41 -  Lord, what do you mean? By what means shall we, this Gentile
51:47 -  Church, so lackluster in its present constitution will move Jews to
51:53 -  a jealousy to adopt and receive a message in the Gospel which they have been 2,000 years in
51:59 -  rejecting. Can't conceive of what can come
52:05 -  from us that will perform it. It's got to be something utterly transcendent,
52:11 -  utterly heavenly, utterly impressive. And we haven't even begun to touch it
52:17 -  or to recognize it or to obtain it because we have not begun to take the mandate of God
52:23 -  seriously. We are without excuse, even if there are no Jews in our present community,
52:29 -  it's still an obligation of prayer and concern and witness. And it won't be long before God
52:37 -  will see to the dispersal of Jews throughout all nations. We'll be without
52:43 -  excuse, or how else can Jesus conduct his first judgment as the seated king
52:49 -  and separate the sheep from the goats and relegate some to the lake of fire and others
52:55 -  to the kingdom prepared for the righteous on one question only, what did you do
53:01 -  for the least of these, my brethren? The issue of the Jew and the last analysis
53:07 -  is the issue of the eternal destiny of sheep and goats. You say, is that odd, is that
53:13 -  fair? That for one thing God is staking so much of an eternal
53:19 -  accountability, but that one thing is everything. That one thing sums up everything.
53:25 -  You'll not be able to be to the Jew unless you are in that place in God, in relationship,
53:31 -  in the place of spirit, in the place of maturity, in the place of sonship. The issue of the Jew
53:37 -  is not an innovation to which you have to rise for the moment. The issue of the Jew will reveal the reality
53:43 -  to which you have been brought over a course of time through the operation of the sanctifying
53:49 -  work and power of God in the church because you've taken his mandate seriously.
53:55 -  Got the idea? Why do you look like you don't have the idea? Why do you look like
54:01 -  I'm talking out of my hat and that I myself am making this up and
54:07 -  that you can afford to be, what's the word, critical and cautious and, well, I don't know.
54:15 -  That's the attitude that has prevailed till now to the deficit
54:21 -  both of the Jew and the church. They have been the victims of our failure to
54:27 -  take the apostolic word seriously and we have been the victims of our failure who has affected
54:33 -  the character of the church and the omission of the mystery of which Paul says, I would not have you
54:39 -  to be ignorant. You're going to go to the communion table tonight
54:45 -  with a greater appreciation than ever before. If that is only grape juice,
54:51 -  if that is only wine, if that is only unleavened bread, it will affect
54:57 -  nothing. But if we recognize that Paul says, who
55:03 -  is sufficient for these things, what shall we say? Why did I want to play hooky tonight and be absent?
55:11 -  Why was I dragging my feet? Why was I feeling oppressed and lacking
55:17 -  in enthusiasm and inspiration as if powers were
55:23 -  pressing down to keep this word from coming forth?
55:29 -  Because it's not only intended for you who are present, it's intended for the church at large. The church will never come
55:35 -  of age in Australia. It will fall short of the glory of God forever if it
55:41 -  forfeits this call. And I'm not commending it to you because I'm Jewish. I'm commending it to you because
55:47 -  I have a function in the church for your sake. God shows his abiding
55:53 -  covenantal relationship with Israel as a nation that he rivets
55:59 -  and attaches to creation itself. It will no sooner dissolve than the creation
56:05 -  that he has established. The stars, the moon, the light, that he has something with the nation.
56:11 -  I shared this the other day with a brother here who was confused about, well, what about that the two become one flesh,
56:17 -  the Jew and the Gentile and the one new man? So then what's all this about Israel?
56:23 -  Well, I said, dear man, you need to distinguish between two mysteries. One is the mystery
56:29 -  of the church made up of Jew and Gentile that constitutes together the
56:35 -  mission and the instrument of God toward the nation, but the nation itself
56:41 -  per se must fulfill God's covenant call
56:47 -  and promise to them per se as a nation. And that's not my destiny.
56:53 -  I'm not attached to the nation. I'm attached to the church so that our reward is the glorified
56:59 -  body. If we have not the glorified body, how shall we ascend and descend on the Son of Man
57:05 -  and fulfill our governmental role in replacing the powers of the air who will be cast
57:11 -  out from that heavenly place where they have become rebellious and usurpers? That's why
57:17 -  when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, when God has a number
57:23 -  that will replace those entities, then the church is completed numerically and then he can turn
57:29 -  and become Israel's deliverer. But when the fullness of the Gentiles is more than a numerical
57:35 -  quotient, it's also a qualitative quotient. There's a dimension that God is waiting for
57:41 -  not just in number but in quality and kind. And I don't know how to describe this. I can only share
57:47 -  a prophetic intuition that the fullness that he's wanting is a Hebraic,
57:53 -  Davidic character for the church where the last semblance of his Gentilic
57:59 -  national, ethnic identification has been met and dealt with and
58:05 -  put away in the sanctifying work of God and the great nature and character of God is visible
58:11 -  and made manifest in his entire people. And in fact, I'm just speaking off the top of my head. I wonder if that's
58:17 -  the thing that will move them to jealousy. That when they see Gentiles exhibiting
58:23 -  a Hebraic reality of a Davidic kind that cannot be learned by
58:29 -  turning back to Jewish roots or wearing a yarmulke or a chalice or some outward experiment
58:35 -  but is written in you corporately that your very character and nature is so
58:41 -  Hebraic, so transformed that they have to recognize that, wow, these
58:47 -  guys have been grafted into our tree, though they were wild branches and fruitless, while we were broken off.
58:53 -  And look at the fruit. Look what exudes from them, not only in their acts
58:59 -  but what they are in their character and in their nature as it is revealed in their life
59:05 -  together. This will take their breath away. This is beyond religion. This is beyond ethics. This is beyond humanism.
59:11 -  This is nothing less nor other than heavenly reality on the Earth in Gentiles
59:17 -  where Jews would least expect to see it. You show forth the face of God
59:23 -  to us, which is exactly what God says in Ezekiel chapter 20 when he says to the Jews,
59:29 -  I will meet with you in the wilderness of nations face to face. And there I will plead with you. There
59:35 -  I will persuade you. There I will converse with you. And there I will bring you into
59:43 -  the bond of my covenant and under the rod of my authority. Because something will happen to you in the wilderness when you are
59:49 -  stripped from your assumptions and your categories and your intellectual baggage
59:55 -  and you're stripped to the core and you're meeting naked reality of truth and eternity head on
01:00:01 -  and when you're bloodied and battered and bruised and nobody wants you and you're despised and hated, and this
01:00:07 -  strange people take you in. They're Gentiles, but they're not Gentiles. They're not physically
01:00:13 -  Jewish, but there's a quality that radiates through this people and it's being expressed
01:00:19 -  in love and compassion and mercy while we're being hated. How do we figure that?
01:00:25 -  These people are exhibiting it effortlessly spontaneously, not a program. I guess we have to because
01:00:31 -  God says. It's the natural outworking of being righteous. That's why
01:00:37 -  Jesus said, you righteous who have given to the least of these my brethren, receive
01:00:43 -  the reward prepared for you and to the kingdom prepared for you, you righteous.
01:00:51 -  That word is much more than just one's ethical position. It's the totality of
01:00:57 -  who God is in you. Who is righteous. And so interfused, so
01:01:03 -  part and parcel of every cell that constitutes your being, that you only live for
01:01:09 -  God, you're for him and through him and to him, to whom be glory forever. It doesn't matter what it costs
01:01:15 -  you. It doesn't matter if your life is cut short or you lose your business or your children suffer. It's for the glory of God forever.
01:01:21 -  You're intoxicated. You're taken up and suffused with the issue of God as God.
01:01:27 -  This is beyond religion. It'll move them to jealousy to believe. But what is Paul
01:01:33 -  falling over about? What is he forming at the mouth of the depth of the riches?
01:01:39 -  Yes, he sees this. But he sees something beyond this and more than this. God's occupied
01:01:45 -  with two realities, two entities. Israel's restoration and the church's transfiguration.
01:01:51 -  Why? Israel has a destiny in the earth as the nexus of God's theocratic rule over
01:01:57 -  the nations that must come out of its Zion. But then there's got to be an accompanying
01:02:03 -  entity in reality in the heavenly places now occupied by alien usurping, fallen,
01:02:09 -  rebellious angels who are turning the attention away from God and toward themselves
01:02:15 -  as the Gods of this world. And who are powerful enough to turn entire nations and jerk and manipulate them
01:02:21 -  to worship them and the state which we saw in Nazi Germany and will see again
01:02:27 -  in the last days. They will be dispossessed. They will be cast out. There's a governmental order here
01:02:33 -  that's got to be completed. Who will replace them? And who will rule not in a usurping way
01:02:39 -  but in a way that is God blessed and God serving? Who will have the wisdom
01:02:45 -  to rule in the kingdom that is to come? That is not just the issue of administration
01:02:51 -  but the issue of character, the issue of meekness, the issue of humility, of sweetness of spirit.
01:02:57 -  Because the government of God is not the issue of the way it is in human government
01:03:03 -  of pocket stuffing and self-aggrandizement. The issue of the government of God is how to live
01:03:09 -  righteously. Insanity and truth, sweetness of spirit, kindness, mercy. Who of us
01:03:15 -  will have been graduated that we can occupy such a governmental role and have influence
01:03:21 -  over some cities? Paul says over some will be given cities for five and some over ten.
01:03:27 -  What determines that? Your earthly tenure, your obedience in this life,
01:03:33 -  your attainment spiritually and the character of God, the attainment of wisdom through the dealings of God.
01:03:39 -  We need to know, dear saints, heaven is not sitting on a cloud with a harp.
01:03:45 -  Heaven is a kingdom that needs to be administered throughout creation by those
01:03:51 -  who are prepared in wisdom and knowledge so to do and share the character and spirit
01:03:57 -  and nature of God himself. We're being prepared for something
01:04:05 -  and the heck of it is if we can but see the mystery, Israel is all finishing school. This tough,
01:04:11 -  obdurate, unwilling people, enemies for our sake because their opposition
01:04:17 -  compels us to a place in God and the spirit and resurrection, reality
01:04:23 -  and power and insight and revelation to deal with them because you don't say to them, are you saved, brother?
01:04:29 -  Step one, step two. Each one is another confrontation, another requirement. I could tell you
01:04:35 -  stories where I have insulted the Jews, where what came out of me you would have said, that's
01:04:41 -  no way to approach them, that you'll offend, but that very offense eventuates later on
01:04:47 -  in the salvation. Look at Jesus's own answer to Nicodemus, who came to him by night. Why do you say, well
01:04:53 -  here's what you need to do, step one, repent, step two, call him. He says you must be born again
01:04:59 -  of the spirit of water. Poor man was so bewildered he left just confused and Jesus let him go like that
01:05:05 -  and in that condition. But if he had presented a formula for salvation that the man could have understood
01:05:11 -  in his human and Jewish mentality and signed on the dotted line, what a plum,
01:05:17 -  what a feather in the cap, what an addition to the growing numbers that follow Jesus. No, he
01:05:23 -  allowed him to be perplexed. He gave him not an earthly answer but a heavenly and this is how and the only way
01:05:29 -  we can meet and face Jews and speak to them that word. How did I get saved?
01:05:35 -  Guy picks me up off the side of the road where I've been standing for three hours in the rain in Switzerland
01:05:41 -  with a brand new car and he doesn't give me the sign, hurry up I'm doing you
01:05:47 -  a favor, gets out of the car, greets me at the side of the road and so I'm doing him the favor. I thought well my mother
01:05:53 -  has told me about men like this. I may be wet and soggy but I'm still attractive. And so he
01:06:01 -  sits me in the front seat, takes my filthy wet rucksack, tosses in the back seat
01:06:07 -  without even thinking of how it affects his upholstery. This is some unusual man.
01:06:13 -  A car is a mode of transport and nothing more and we start to drive off. He turns
01:06:19 -  and he looks at me. He says in German, why are you traveling like this?
01:06:25 -  And so well as I could, choked spluttering, I said I'm a modern man
01:06:31 -  whose life is broken at its foundations. I'm seeking for the deepest answers to life. And I'm
01:06:37 -  Jewish. The moment I said that, I said you fool. Did you have to let that cat
01:06:43 -  out of the bag? Now he'll turn and stiffen and drive on and you've
01:06:49 -  blown it, blown it. Instead the man turned, he was radiant, like a neon tube, he was glowing. That I'm Jewish.
01:06:55 -  It never meant that much to me. What's he getting excited about? He insisted we stop for
01:07:03 -  refreshments at his expense. You'll have to read this in the book, Ben Israel. In one of those golden moments in an entire
01:07:09 -  lifetime where you're picked up by a stranger. And he wasn't anything special to look at. And
01:07:17 -  we're talking and he's drawing out my heart and I find myself telling him things I've not shared with my
01:07:23 -  ex-German wife, with my Jewish mother, with my closest intellectual friends. He's a total stranger. He's drawing my
01:07:29 -  heart out. And I'm spitting out the deepest frustrations and vexations of my life as a modern man
01:07:35 -  without any answer in sight because I've already been a Marxist. I've already embraced ideologies. I know
01:07:41 -  there's no hope. But what alternative? What else is there? And so I finally finished. I leaned back,
01:07:47 -  wondering why I'm sharing like that with a stranger. Gentile. And I thought, now what is he going to say?
01:07:53 -  I had my arms over my chest. Tough. Cynical. He said, Art, do you know what
01:08:01 -  it is that the world needs? I thought, wow, this guy knows how to ask the questions.
01:08:07 -  I'm dying for what the world needs. He said, what the world needs,
01:08:13 -  Art, is for men to wash one another's feet. Forty-one years later,
01:08:21 -  I've not yet recovered from the impact of that one statement. I had never
01:08:27 -  read about foot washing, but when he spoke it, something pierced my deeps because I was a rebel
01:08:33 -  in the school system. I was an antagonist to the administration. My last public statement at a faculty
01:08:39 -  meeting was, we need a revolution. And here's a man saying, what the world needs is to
01:08:45 -  wash one another's feet. Immediately I had a vision of the angry Art Katz's of the world are going to save the world
01:08:51 -  by bringing a bloodbath, washing the feet of the school principal, of the administrators, of those with whom
01:08:57 -  we're in opposition. Children washing the feet of their parents in the generational gap in tension that characterizes our
01:09:03 -  age. Palestinians and Jews washing each other's feet. And something like a cry came out,
01:09:09 -  Eureka! This is it! What the world needs is a spirit of humility,
01:09:15 -  and I didn't know there was such a thing as a spirit until this man said it.
01:09:21 -  I fell out of my seat. Physically I remained, my human spirit was on the floor, weeping,
01:09:27 -  whimpering, and in that condition, this man is telling me in German the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
01:09:33 -  And I'm wanting to complain and say, hey, I'm Jewish, that's not for me. You have your book, you know, but I couldn't speak.
01:09:39 -  I lost my voice when he finished sharing that Gospel. I knew
01:09:45 -  that I knew I was hearing the words of eternal life. I left that man
01:09:51 -  like a drunken sailor, I was just swaying back and forth under the impact and power
01:09:57 -  of that confrontation at a critical moment when my life was hanging by a very thin strand.
01:10:03 -  One wrong word. I was 34 years old, I had lived a long life of
01:10:09 -  adventure, involvement, relationship, disillusioned, cynical. One wrong word. One more cliché.
01:10:15 -  I didn't need Marxist clichés, I didn't need Christian clichés. If he said, are you saved, brother? I'd be dead
01:10:21 -  today, folks. If he said, do you know Jesus? I'd be dead today. He spoke the one thing
01:10:27 -  given by the Holy Spirit in a moment of crisis that would make it or break it by
01:10:33 -  the one God who knew me from my mother's womb. What the world needs is for men
01:10:39 -  to wash one another's feet. I was saved by the true word sent
01:10:45 -  from the throne of heaven by a Swiss man whom I've never been able to find again.
01:10:51 -  Had his name and address in my wallet, I got pickpocketed in Cairo my first day in Egypt, lost it.
01:10:57 -  And I've been back to Switzerland numerous times to that very neighborhood and asking people every year, have you
01:11:03 -  ever heard of Edwin? He was a bookkeeper in an automobile agency, sings in the church choir.
01:11:09 -  He knows about Dure, the architect and artist. He knows about Carl Jung. He's a man with a breadth
01:11:15 -  of understanding. Nobody has ever heard or seen or known of such a man.
01:11:21 -  I have to ask 41 years later, was he a man? Was he an angel?
01:11:27 -  And in fact, if Jews don't ask that question about us, we're not yet in the right place.
01:11:33 -  They've got to ask, was it man, was it an angel? Because how we relate to them, what we say, is so from
01:11:39 -  heaven, we're free from fear and anxiety, we can't be insulted. Nothing that they
01:11:45 -  say is going to jar us out of kilter and make us to react.
01:11:51 -  We're in another place. And that's got to be a demonstration. I will not attain to it
01:11:57 -  except we attain to it in the church, by the church and through the church. And the remarkable opportunity
01:12:03 -  given God to exhort, to rebuke, to correct, to shape, to form his character
01:12:09 -  in a body. That kind of Christianity is a suffering. Read my book,
01:12:15 -  True Fellowship. Community is a suffering before it's a glory. It's a humiliation.
01:12:21 -  It's failed relationship. It's disappointment. It's being accused. I've suffered more
01:12:27 -  from Christians in my own community than I have ever suffered from my own Jewish kinsmen in my
01:12:33 -  confrontations with them at universities and in other places. Church is a suffering before it's a glory.
01:12:39 -  I will not be willing for it until we take the mandate of the Lord seriously.
01:12:45 -  And receive the grace to go on from grace to grace, faith to faith, glory to glory.
01:12:51 -  Because this mandate is of him. It's not ours. But it's also through him.
01:12:57 -  He has to give the enablement. This would be impossible without a resurrection. So long as we're content
01:13:03 -  merely to honor and to acknowledge the truth of resurrection as credo, but do not
01:13:09 -  ourselves live and move and have our being in it, we're falling short of the glory. And we've been getting away with that till now.
01:13:15 -  Who has got to be a resurrection saint in present Christianity? To fulfill the program,
01:13:21 -  to say amen, to sing the choruses, to put the doll in a collection plate, to come to meetings. Who cannot do that
01:13:27 -  out of his own well-meaning intention and humanity? But try and be to the Jew what you ought.
01:13:33 -  And that's where your humanity ends. You can only meet them on resurrection
01:13:39 -  ground. And you'll not just find it in the moment in which you're brought into confrontation. It has got to be
01:13:45 -  all your moments. That Swiss man did not just rise to the occasion. He was always in the
01:13:51 -  occasion. He was in season. He was in the Lord. And the Lord brought the right man
01:13:57 -  to the right moment to the need to be met by one word. That if it had come in any other way, it would have
01:14:03 -  cut that very slim thing in which I was being suspended over a precipice and I would have fallen
01:14:09 -  into destruction and damnation forever. I was saved by a sent word, by a
01:14:15 -  sent man in a sent moment who was a prepared vessel that I have to ask 41 years later, was
01:14:21 -  it a man? We're called to be angelic saints. So when we leave this tenure, this
01:14:27 -  earth, the transition is hardly anything. We've been so acclimated to the heavenly dimensions
01:14:33 -  and heavenly realities, it's just an adjustment of location. The reality is already known by us. We've grown
01:14:39 -  into it. How then shall we occupy the heavenly places? Ruling and reigning with Christ,
01:14:47 -  which is more than administration. So I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this
01:14:55 -  mystery. Lest you should be wise in your own conceit. That's the inevitable consequence
01:15:01 -  and that blindness in part has happened to Israel, the nation, the people, until
01:15:07 -  the fullness of the Gentiles become in. Isn't it remarkable that God in His wisdom
01:15:13 -  makes reciprocal the redemption of Jews and the fulfillment of
01:15:19 -  Gentiles. He makes the one the condition for the other. So Jewish salvation does not
01:15:25 -  come through Jewish deserving or Jewish accomplishment. It comes by the fulfillment of things pertaining
01:15:31 -  to the Gentiles by an essentially Gentile church. God has fixed this inextricable
01:15:37 -  connection that the one cannot be obtained without the other. We've not seen that connection.
01:15:43 -  And it needs to be restored. It will be the incentive for bringing
01:15:49 -  the fullness of the Gentiles in so that all Israel shall be saved. That does not mean
01:15:55 -  Jews and Gentiles who now comprise the new Israel. It means those Jews who constitute
01:16:01 -  the Israel of God. The restored nation. They may only be a surviving remnant
01:16:07 -  but they will constitute the redeemed Israel of God that returns to Zion with
01:16:13 -  everlasting joy in His heads. And releases the Lord to be their King at the throne
01:16:19 -  of David as the son of David. That's the all Israel that shall be saved.
01:16:27 -  So as it is written, shouldn't we be concerned that what God has written be fulfilled?
01:16:33 -  Where's our jealousy for His name if we allow something to be written that will not
01:16:39 -  find its fulfillment because we are slack to be the instrument by which what is written will be
01:16:45 -  fulfilled. We ought to be jealous for His name, His honor, His covenants and what is written.
01:16:53 -  Jesus always said, it is written of me. Written. He had to fulfill what was written. We have to
01:16:59 -  fulfill what is written. And the same way that He fulfilled it which I'll be speaking to you probably as of tomorrow
01:17:05 -  morning. How He fulfilled it is the same means by which we must.
01:17:11 -  For this is my covenant with them when I shall take away their sins. I won't even wait for their repentance. I don't make that a condition.
01:17:17 -  I myself, in my mercy, will take away their sins and their transgressions.
01:17:23 -  And then later on they will abhor themselves for all of the
01:17:29 -  grievous things that we have done against the Lord. But the repentance is not made a condition for our salvation.
01:17:35 -  I will take away their sins. It's purely mercy.
01:17:43 -  For the gifts and callings of God are without repentance. For you in times past have not believed God yet now have attained mercy through their
01:17:49 -  unbelief. They're falling away. They're being broken off from their tree has enlabeled you to be grafted in.
01:17:55 -  And how many of you appreciate that? How many of you recognize that? How many of you see that as something that is more than
01:18:01 -  a metaphor, but a very significant reality?
01:18:07 -  Unless you see yourself as grafted into their tree, and are grateful for that privilege,
01:18:13 -  you will yet be a dead wild branch incapable of bearing fruit. And furthermore,
01:18:19 -  thus saith Katz, even though you're technically grafted in, if you don't realize and
01:18:25 -  appreciate and are grateful for that engrafting, you'll still be a dead branch. The sap will only
01:18:31 -  flow to be fruit forming if you both acknowledge and appreciate and express gratitude
01:18:37 -  for the privilege of being grafted in to someone else's tree, Israel.
01:18:43 -  Can you see why Paul says, oh the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,
01:18:49 -  he knows what gentile pride is, and how God in his wisdom compels
01:18:55 -  the gentile to be broken at the nexus of his pride because he cannot be fruit bearing
01:19:01 -  unless he is gratefully grafted in to Israel's tree
01:19:07 -  and receives the sap that flows exclusively through her roots.
01:19:13 -  Have you recognized that? Have you been grateful for that? Because of this gentile pride
01:19:19 -  that says, I don't care for that tree, I want to be an independent thing all by myself.
01:19:25 -  I'm not all that happy to be likened and equated and centered in something
01:19:31 -  Jewish. That tree is not aesthetic to look upon. It's gnarled and twisted
01:19:37 -  and ugly and battered and beat and we want to be independent
01:19:43 -  of that ugliness. God says, oh yeah? Then be fruitless. Be wild. If you want to be fruit
01:19:49 -  bearing only by virtue of being grafted in, I've made a space for you by breaking them off.
01:19:55 -  And if you have entered by faith, I can also graft them
01:20:01 -  back in again. It's a mystery, dear saints, and we have
01:20:07 -  to appreciate this mystery. Not only appreciate it, make it central to our whole apostolic mindset,
01:20:13 -  our whole framework of understanding of the dimensions and magnitude of the faith
01:20:19 -  and of our call for which we now come to a heightened appreciation, not only of the communion
01:20:25 -  table by which we are strengthened and renewed again by the power of the spirit and life
01:20:31 -  through wine and bread, but appreciate each other. We can't attain to this character, to
01:20:37 -  this overcoming capacity to rule and reign, except through the benevolence that
01:20:43 -  comes to us from other saints. Who's going to correct us? Who's going to exhort us? Who's going to rebuke us? Who's going to speak
01:20:49 -  the truth in love that you might grow up into the fullness and stature of Jesus Christ if it's not other members of the body?
01:20:55 -  This is more than sitting in a congregation for services. We have to go again from house to house daily,
01:21:01 -  breaking bread. We need to welcome the sanctifying work of God that cannot be performed in a thousand Sundays.
01:21:07 -  It needs the intensity of frequent relationship that community is if this is going to be
01:21:13 -  fulfilled. Got the idea? God has in His wisdom structured something
01:21:19 -  that we need to recognize and yield to, surrender and receive, and not begrudgingly,
01:21:25 -  but with gratitude and with rejoicing. Thank you, Lord. You've saved us from being eternal
01:21:31 -  dum-dums. You've saved us from just going through the motions of correct faith. You've saved us
01:21:37 -  from reducing the Gospel to a formula are you saved, brother, step one, step two. You've given us a requirement,
01:21:43 -  a mandate, which if we can meet it with the Jew, what Greek will intimidate us? What
01:21:49 -  nation will be for us formidable once we have tested the reality of your
01:21:55 -  foolish message and its power to that people? All the depth of the riches,
01:22:01 -  both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. For this is of Him, saints,
01:22:07 -  and His fulfillment is also through Him. It will not be enough, I'm repeating myself, merely to acknowledge the truth
01:22:13 -  of resurrection. In fact, what you're seeing tonight and hearing tonight is a resurrection
01:22:19 -  phenomenon. It wasn't enough of me to pick up with a blotter when I left the dining hall to come here tonight. People even
01:22:25 -  came up to me and said, Art, what's wrong? And I couldn't tell them. I'm down. I'm depleted.
01:22:31 -  I have no inspiration. I have no zeal. I don't even want to be here.
01:22:37 -  But what are we getting? If we're getting anything out of that depleted condition, it's
01:22:43 -  because there's a resurrection from that death. Or else we have all men are most to be pitied. Why
01:22:49 -  was that necessary, Art, that you had to be so depleted in order to bring the communication of this mystery? Because
01:22:55 -  not only are we prophetic men required to exposit the mystery, we're required to exhibit the
01:23:01 -  means by which you are to fulfill it. The same way this word came to you out of my depletedness
01:23:07 -  with vigor and enthusiasm that is not human and not soulish,
01:23:13 -  but His very life is the same means by which you will fulfill it. We have got to
01:23:19 -  demonstrate as well as exposit that means, which is not pleasant.
01:23:25 -  But it works. Or else we have, of all men, most to be pitied. How else
01:23:31 -  shall I go on Friday for London to Kenya, to Uganda, to Cameroon,
01:23:37 -  to Burkina Faso, one to three thousand ministers, not completing this trip till May 25, seven
01:23:43 -  weeks in seven nations with seventeen flights, except on the basis of the resurrection life.
01:23:49 -  If there's no resurrection, I am of all men, most to be pitied. But I'm before you as a testimony
01:23:55 -  that this resurrection is more than correct doctrine. It's God's reality, obtained through His suffering
01:24:01 -  and death, because He did not leave us orphans. And He'll
01:24:07 -  supply when He sees that we are saying yes to the call.
01:24:13 -  Lord, thank You for the mercy that has come to us who are drinking blood out of skulls
01:24:19 -  in pagan places, who are without God and hope in the world, who have been brought nigh
01:24:25 -  by the blood of Israel's Messiah to the covenants and hopes and promises of that nation.
01:24:31 -  And even to be part of the commonwealth of Israel
01:24:37 -  and be fitted into a destiny linked with them by which their restoration is obtained
01:24:43 -  and our glorification equally. Who is sufficient for these things? Lord, this is
01:24:49 -  awesome. Communicate the mystery, Lord. Bring it into our deeps. Let it govern and
01:24:55 -  affect every category of our life and being. The subject of Israel is not a separate item
01:25:01 -  on the shelf. It's integral to the whole of apostolic prophetic faith and being.
01:25:07 -  It brings us to it. And you're glorified only by it and nothing else.
01:25:13 -  So we thank you for this, that it's of you, but it's also through you that it might
01:25:19 -  be to you as glory forever. What a privilege for us to be
01:25:25 -  instruments by which your glory is obtained forever.
01:25:31 -  Who can be born in a church that recognizes and receives that call and mandate?
01:25:37 -  Who can be listless and drifting and without a call to significance
01:25:43 -  for his every day and his every moment if this is the end of it?
01:25:49 -  So Lord, seal this message, my God. Not only what was said
01:25:55 -  but what was unsaid, the in-between the lines, the spirit of the speaking that
01:26:01 -  suffuses this whole remarkable cosmic sense of things that cannot even be
01:26:07 -  defined by words but has got to be assimilated. It's got to be apprehended. It's got to be intuitive,
01:26:13 -  taken in to mystery. There's only so much that can be said to explicate mystery.
01:26:19 -  In the last analysis, it needs to be apprehended or we need to be apprehended by it.
01:26:25 -  Or we'll become wise in our own conceit, God forbid. Blessed as people would, perform that glory, I
01:26:31 -  pray. If you have called for this word tonight and I had to bear a certain kind of dying
01:26:37 -  in order to obtain the life to communicate it, then let it not fall to the ground. Let it come
01:26:43 -  into the foundations of the church that is the church of this nation and beyond.
01:26:49 -  And we will thank you eternally with great gratitude for the privilege of the high calling of God
01:26:55 -  in Christ Jesus in whose name we pray. Amen.
