Arts Testimony

00:00 -  Obviously, you know that recently I met the German Aron in Israel, so we set a date that was delayed for a year more or less, his arrival here. And when the date was finally fixed, he wrote me a note through the email and asked me if it would be a problem if I brought a partner with him. Yes, it's fine, brother, with great pleasure.
00:44 -  Then he brought this partner, and we started talking about how the Lord guided us, me in particular, in the question of genealogy. In the question of two weeks in Pennsylvania, by miracle after miracle, I learned things that my mom and her sisters tried to find out for 80 years. Then I mentioned to them something about who my grandfather was, one on the side of my mom.
01:37 -  Then this couple started asking me, and your grandfather, by chance, did not go to Canada one day to work there on a farm? Yes, yes. And your grandfather died there, working on that farm, helping the indigenous people? Yes, that's right. And his first name is Santiago? James? That's right. Then the sister says, my grandmother married him.
02:25 -  So we are cousins, politicians, first, how do you say it? My first grade. Politicians. Because her father and my mother were brothers. Imagine what the Lord is like. What confirmation that we are walking in the Spirit and that all this was organized by a God of love, a tender God. Amen. So it's a pleasure to have these brothers, Daniel and Sara Gotalese, and they are working with brother Arturo in his work there in Minnesota.
03:28 -  Well brother, it's not all that important. Who's first or second? What, are you interjecting your human thoughts? When God himself has established a priority and an order to the Jew first. Don't save them for last. Last somehow never comes. They are the enemies for your sake. Someone has asked Jose in the little intermission, ask Art, how do you witness to a Jew?
04:36 -  Step one? Principle number one? Wouldn't you like that? How to do it? One, two, three. You're becoming so Americanized. There is no one, two, three. There is no formula. It's an ultimate requirement. Just like preaching. As if life and death is at stake. And who is sufficient for these things? That there's a God who has to be made unto us wisdom. Give us his very words. We might start with them with an insult.
05:42 -  As I have done on numerous occasions with my Jewish kinsmen. What, you call yourself a lover of truth? And spend countless hours in university libraries. Searching out esoteric information. And have never once in quiet. As to the validity of the credentials of this Jesus. Who all the world worships as their messiah. What intellectual integrity is that? As I said to a woman on an airplane. And we sat on one on the flight coming here. If you are not jealous for the truth. Which is always inconvenient. How then are you Jewish?
06:58 -  Now, I'm not saying that you have to say that. I'm not giving you a principle. I'm giving you an illustration. Of how variable the Lord will be. When he has the possession of your mouth. And you're not counting on John 3.16 as a secure formula. When you don't know what to say. When it's only for you an expediency and a convenience. John 3.16 is not only the word of God. It's inept cliche. The Lord did not give it. How dare you then to employ it. To save yourself from embarrassment.
08:10 -  When you have not the faith to trust God. For that unique word. Calculated for that Jewish soul. Whom he knows from their mother's womb. And has brought to a moment of truth. To hear something that will pierce them through. Out of your mouth. The Jew compels us to be the church. Their unbelief in apostasy is our challenge.
09:07 -  And that church that can confront the authorities of its nation on Mars Hill. Will also be able to confront the Jew. Are you praising God for this wisdom? Of how the Lord has joined us with this people. In an inextricable reciprocity. We would not have chosen them. They would not have chosen us. God in his wisdom has compelled us to be for one another. What we must. Or neither one of us will come to the eternal place of God's glory.
10:15 -  That's why God has dispersed us Jews into all nations. I have found them in Tokyo. I have a Jewish Hasidic Orthodox friend who speaks Mandarin Chinese. The church is not exempt anywhere. If they are not here, he will bring them. When brother? In a soon hour. In the fulfillment of his word. In the time of Jacob's trouble. Of which Jesus spoke in Matthew 24. That there is such a time of tribulation that will exceed anything that had previously come before. Or will ever come again.
11:23 -  And if that time were not cut short. No Jewish flesh would survive. You can count on this. The day will come. When they will be coming up out of Argentina. Brazil and Peru. All the nations in which we have been dispersed. And come through the little neck of land mass that is called Central America. Destitute, hopeless and forsaken. Driven and persecuted unto death. Because the powers of the nations do not want their survival. Unless their king come and rule over all nations. When this comes it will come suddenly. They will not be able to take their fortunes with them. What is only on their back.
12:38 -  I have had a dream of Argentina. I've never been there. But I know it was Argentina. Because in the dream a man says, well how do you like Argentina? But what is the one scene that has burned into my memory? By looking into a building like this. What we call in the states an armory. And it was filled with canvas cots where people sleep. And evidently there were people that had slept in it that very night. But had to be moved on from that place to another.
13:34 -  In flight. It's coming to them. They will be coming down from North America. That's why we ourselves are in Minnesota. You cannot believe our winters. There's no way I can describe them for you. And we've been there 24 years. Because there came a moment of time when the Lord brought me to a property in that remote wilderness as an urban New Yorker.
14:38 -  A graduate from the University of California. And he took me to a remote place that was nothing to establish a refuge for Jews in flight in the last days. Matthew 25 speaks of the Lord's first rendering of judgment. After he is seated as king with the restoration of Israel's remnants that will constitute the restored nations.
15:42 -  And on what question does he make his judgment of the Gentile nations? What did you do with the least of these my brethren? When did we see you naked?
16:18 -  As you did not do it for the least of these my brethren. You did not do it unto me. You thought you were spiritual. But you were not able to discern my affinity and union with my own people who had been brought to become the least in all nations.
16:58 -  Dispised and rejected of men. Marred more than any man. In that day they will not have any beauty that we should desire them. And maybe we didn't want to recognize that they were the Lord's brethren. Because to take them in, to clothe them and to feed them, to shelter them and give them refuge, to extend mercy that they might obtain mercy, might well require our lives.
17:55 -  For if the anti-Christ power is loosed to torment and to pursue them through all nations, of which the Nazi time was only a preview, what will be the fate of someone who is caught helping them? It may well be your life. And why should you? And what did they ever do for you? They're probably getting what they deserve.
18:47 -  They're international bankers. It's going to take an uncommon love by a people who will not be in their best and most polite condition. Angry and disturbed by the suddenness of what has come upon them. Everything stripped and taken from them.
19:32 -  They might blame the Church, as they do now for the last Holocaust. And they will blame the Church again. And come to you in that condition. Embittered and hostile. The enemies for your sake. And not even grateful.
20:04 -  For your costly sacrifice in hospitality. What will be your response then? In the crisis of that confrontation.
20:23 -  What will it reveal about you? You can read these scriptures at your own leisure. Ezekiel chapter 20 from verse 33.
20:40 -  Don't look at it now. God says, I will meet with you, speaking to Israel. The Jews globally.
20:53 -  Jacob, the people of Jacob. I will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations. Face to face.
21:08 -  And there you will come into the bond of my covenant. And under the rod of my authority. You will be stripped in your wilderness experience.
21:28 -  And be able to consider categories that you never would have considered had you remained in your luxury and prosperity. That is how I got saved. 35 years ago.
21:54 -  In the nations. In flight. Moving from place to place.
22:02 -  A man who had come to the end of himself. The end of his categories. The end of his humanistic assumptions.
22:15 -  The end of his ideologies. Cast out in the world. Uprooted from the place that was familiar.
22:26 -  With everything that I owned on my back. Being moved and carried, I knew not where. Being moved and carried, I knew not where.
22:44 -  I kept a journal of that experience. It's my first book. It's in English, French, Hebrew, German, Swedish.
22:56 -  But it's not in Spanish. Pray for that. It is a remarkable insight.
23:05 -  Into the mind of the modern Jewish man. Confronted with Christ. In the extremity of his life and need.
23:18 -  By a God whom he was not seeking. Because someone picked him up off the side of the road. Because someone picked him up off the side of the road.
23:34 -  Someone took him in. Someone spoke to him, not a cliché, but the word of the living God. Someone spoke to him, not a formula, not a cliché, but the word of the living God.
23:55 -  Someone put in his hands a book that he had never read, never opened. I was a Jewish intellectual. The New Testament.
24:07 -  And from the very first reading. Above the deck of a tramp steamer. A cheap ship.
24:20 -  The least expensive way that a man could travel from Italy to Greece. I'll be making the same trip in a few months. As a believer.
24:36 -  That I made then as an atheist. And I opened up this book. And the only reason I wanted to read it.
24:46 -  And the only reason I wanted to read it. Having been contemptuous of the Bible, let alone the New Testament. Was the quality and character of the people whom I was meeting off the side of the road.
25:05 -  The only reason I wanted to read it. Was the quality and character of the people whom I was meeting off the side of the road. I was a proud man being stripped.
25:20 -  I was a proud man being stripped. As my entire nation will be. As my entire nation will be.
25:31 -  And must be. For there will not be an easy way for them to come to the Lord. Are you saying, brother?
25:45 -  It would be like the proverbial water of the duck's back. The proverbial water of the duck's back. An idiom, an American expression.
25:57 -  But in the crisis of destitution. Stripped of our arrogance and of our ideologies. Our ear is strangely open.
26:15 -  To hear some new thing. Even with the despised name. Of Jesus.
26:24 -  I was standing in the rain for three hours in Switzerland. The cars went by as if I didn't exist. Where was human brotherhood?
26:46 -  In which my faith had been invested all my life long. They went right on by without seeing me. Wise to avoid me.
27:01 -  In the angry and bitter condition I was in. But a man stopped. With a brand new car.
27:16 -  And I thought, uh oh. What's in it for him? And he didn't just greet me, come on in now. He got out of the car.
27:29 -  And took my filthy wet rucksack. My backpack. And threw it in the back of his car.
27:43 -  I thought, isn't he concerned about his upholstery? What manner of man is this? And he had me to sit down.
27:58 -  And we drove off. And I felt as if I were the exalted guest. How can a man be made to feel like that?
28:14 -  Who has been reduced to absolutely nothing. And he turned to me and he said in German. Why are you traveling like this?
28:28 -  And somehow I had a grace to answer. Never been good in languages. I said, I'm a modern man.
28:39 -  I might have said, I am THE modern man. That's what we Jews are. We are the epitome of modernity.
28:53 -  We have established it. You watch our movies. Read our books.
29:03 -  Go to our psychiatrists. The modern man at the end of himself. Whose world had failed.
29:16 -  And his false Gods. I said, I'm a modern man. Whose life is broken at its foundations.
29:29 -  And I'm seeking for the deepest answers to life. And I said, and by the way, I'm a Jew. I wanted to catch the words and bring them back into my life.
29:46 -  Did you have to tell him that? Now watch him get turned off. I turned to look.
29:56 -  And the man was beaming like a radiant light. A Jew, he said. As if this was somehow something special.
30:08 -  For me, it had only been an enigma at a problem all my life. Oh, he insisted we stop for refreshments. What a golden conversation.
30:25 -  What a moment of truth. What did he say? Nothing.
30:34 -  But did he ever listen? Did he ever draw my heart out? I couldn't believe what I was sharing with him.
30:43 -  The deepest secrets of my life. The anguish of my soul. The frustration of a man whose Gods have failed.
30:56 -  The world without hope. Collapsing under its own moral weight. Nation against nation and race against race.
31:08 -  Genocidal bloodbath. Genocidal bloodbath. There's no answer.
31:20 -  So I looked at this man. What is he going to say to me? I'm a former Marxist.
31:29 -  I'm a university graduate. There's nothing new under the sun. He was very ordinary looking.
31:40 -  He said to me in a quiet voice. He said, Art, do you know what it is that the world needs? I thought, this man knows how to ask the questions.
31:59 -  I'll take a good question. Over ten cheap answers. I'll take a good question.
32:08 -  Over ten cheap answers any day. Maybe the fault of the churches. We've given answers before the questions have been raised.
32:30 -  Anybody can give an answer as a formula. But who can raise the question? Not only by their words but by their life.
32:47 -  Yeah, I want to know what the world needs. I've been looking all my adult life long. That's why I was a high school dropout, a merchant seaman.
33:02 -  Attending Marxist institutes. Yeah, I want to know what the world needs. Had my arms folded over my chest.
33:16 -  And he said to me with a quiet voice. Art, he said, what the world needs is for men to wash one another's feet.
33:33 -  And down I went. Pierced through. I had a vision on the spot.
33:44 -  Of all of the angry, self-sufficient art cats of the world. Their ideologies, their programs. Humbling themselves.
33:59 -  To wash the feet of the lowest. And a silent cry went up out of my heart. You don't need programs.
34:14 -  We need the spirit of humility. It was the first time in 34 years that the word spirit had ever issued from my lips.
34:32 -  It's a category I did not know. I was an empirical Jew that had to feel, touch and measure. What is spirit?
34:47 -  Spirit of humility. That could change the world overnight? Without a drop of blood being shed?
34:56 -  If this man had said, would you need brothers to be saved? If this man had said, look brother, what you need is to be saved. Do you know Jesus?
35:05 -  Do you know where I would be now? Dead! That's all I needed to hear.
35:14 -  Was one more cliché. That was what I needed to hear. One more cliché.
35:23 -  One more word that was only a formula. A religious reflex action. But God had a man
35:32 -  out of whose mouth the word could be spoken. Calculated in the wisdom of God. Calculated in the wisdom of God.
35:41 -  Who pierced my heart. Who pierced my heart. Who pierced my heart.
35:50 -  Who pierced my heart. And then he began to speak to me about the gospel of Jesus Christ in German.
35:59 -  And then he began to speak to me about the gospel of Jesus Christ in German. I wanted to say, that's not for me.
36:08 -  And what am I going to tell him? I'm Jewish, we have our own book. I'm Jewish, we have our own book.
36:18 -  But I had no voice. My voice had gone out from me. I was stupefied by what he had said.
36:27 -  I had to hear what he was saying. And I left that man like a drunken man. And I left that man like a drunken man.
36:36 -  I lurked and staggered under the weight of what he said. How many times I have looked for that man? How many times I have looked for that man?
36:45 -  How many times I have looked for that man? How many times have I been in Switzerland? In that very neighborhood, outside Zurich.
36:54 -  As a minister, saying to Christians, As a minister, saying to Christians, Do you know an Edwin?
37:03 -  I had his name and address in my wallet. I had his name and address in my wallet. But I got pickpocketed in Egypt.
37:12 -  That's what happens every time we go there. That's what happens every time we go there. So I lost it.
37:21 -  But he works for an automobile agency. He's a bookkeeper and an accountant. He sings in the choir.
37:30 -  He knows about art and philosophy. Do you know such a man? Nobody ever knows Edwin.
37:39 -  I have to think now. I have to think now. 33 years later.
37:48 -  Was it there such a man? Was it there such a man? He looked so ordinary.
37:57 -  But his words were so peaceful. His hearing of me was such an act of love. Was that a man?
38:06 -  Or is that an angel? Here's what I want to say, saints. Until the Jews of Guatemala City
38:15 -  Until the Jews of Guatemala City Can say about you Is that a woman or an angel?
38:24 -  Is that a man or an angel? You are the angels When you bring them the word of God
38:34 -  That is given in the moment By the Spirit of God By those who live by that Spirit
38:43 -  And have no other source of life in here They are waiting for that word. They are waiting for that word.
38:52 -  How shall they call upon them of whom they have not heard? Haven't they heard, brother? Not any more than I heard in North America.
39:01 -  Not any more than I heard in North America. So what did I hear? Some Jesus that looks like a ballet dancer on a cross?
39:10 -  Totally un-Jewish? A Christian culture? I never heard.
39:19 -  How shall they hear except one preach? How shall one preach except he be sent? How shall one preach except he be sent?
39:28 -  How shall one preach except he be sent? For hearing comes by the words of God For hearing comes by the words of God
39:37 -  Faith comes by hearing the Word of God Faith comes by hearing the Word of God It is created by the Word
39:46 -  It is created by the Word By those who, until that moment Could not believe
39:56 -  The Word that is preached By one whom is sent Sent from whom?
40:06 -  From an apostolic body More than the numerical accumulation of saints The community of faith
40:21 -  Living in the authenticity of that faith Living in the authenticity of that faith Can be sent forth out and from them
40:30 -  Can be sent forth out and from them By the same way that we have come to you in these days By the same way that we have come to you in these days
40:39 -  Out of such a community By the laying on of hands By those who have remained
40:48 -  And us who were sent That you could hear something more Than a clever virtuoso
40:57 -  That you could hear something more Than a clever virtuoso Or someone very intelligent
41:06 -  But that the Word of God would be for you an event But that the Word of God would be for you an event Through a man sent
41:16 -  The whole meaning of the word apostolic This is what the Jews are waiting Even in their ignorance
41:34 -  I had not yet recovered from this confrontation I had not yet recovered from this confrontation With this man
41:43 -  When I came to the city of Zurich itself When I came to the city of Zurich itself And walking in the woods surrounding the city
41:52 -  And walking in the woods surrounding the city I met an American girl I met an American girl
42:01 -  With whom I should have had nothing to do With whom I should have had nothing to do She had just graduated high school
42:12 -  She had just graduated high school She was on vacation in Europe The kind that we Jews call wasps
42:21 -  The kind that we Jews call wasps White Anglo-Saxon
42:30 -  Protestant The very antithesis The very antithesis
42:39 -  Antiseptic, bloodless Antiseptic, bloodless Blond
42:48 -  But she was remarkably engaged But she was remarkably engaged She wanted to walk with me
42:57 -  Utterly without guile Transparent Transparent
43:06 -  I said, why are you being kind? Why are you doing this? She said, it's the love of God
43:15 -  She said, it's the love of God I had been a Marxist But where had I seen kindness?
43:24 -  But where had I seen kindness? I was probing this girl Her motives, her reasons
43:33 -  She answered every question the same way It's the love of God I couldn't bear to hear the phrase anymore
43:42 -  God forbid I thought, I'm going to let this girl have it My hobby was to engage Christians in debate
43:51 -  My hobby was to engage Christians in debate My pastime My pastime
44:00 -  So what's this little girl to me? I said, look kid You're a nice girl and all that
44:09 -  I can't stand this God talk Answer one question for me Answer one question for me
44:18 -  That no Christian has ever successfully been able to answer That no Christian has ever successfully been able to answer You say it's the love of God?
44:27 -  How do you know that God even exists? How do you know that God even exists? Got her now
44:36 -  She'll think of some clever things she learned in Sunday school She'll think of some clever things she learned in Sunday school And I'll demolish her
44:45 -  And I'll demolish her But she looked up with that Anglo-Saxon face But she looked up with that Anglo-Saxon face
44:54 -  Full of the light of God And she said with complete sincerity And she said with complete sincerity
45:03 -  All innocence I know that God is He lives in me
45:12 -  Boom And down I went Like an ox that had been struck
45:22 -  Boxers sinking to the canvas What hit me? What did she say?
45:31 -  It wasn't even intellectual Little theological What gave it its power?
45:40 -  It was true It was true And she had the face to prove it
45:49 -  And she had the face to prove it You have a destiny, children You have a destiny, children
45:58 -  A collision course with history God is going to uproot His chosen people God is going to uproot His chosen people
46:07 -  In every place where they have established their security In every place where they have established their security God rejects the affluence
46:17 -  Nations Because I will shake them In the midst of all nations
46:26 -  And not so much as one kernel shall fall to the ground And not so much as one kernel shall fall to the ground You would do well to believe that all nations
46:35 -  You would do well to believe that all nations Includes Guatemala Well, for one thing I would not be here
46:45 -  The fact that I'm here indicates to me You have a destiny They're going to come to the wilderness of your nation
46:57 -  They're going to come to the wilderness of your nation Not the principal and lofty and illustrious places Not the principal and lofty and illustrious places
47:06 -  The back roads The back roads The dirt streets
47:15 -  The poor neighborhoods At night, secretly And God will meet with them there
47:26 -  Through you Face to face No matter how you are provoked
47:35 -  No matter how impolite they are No matter how impolite they are No matter how ungrateful
47:44 -  They see only one thing The consistent love of God The consistent love of God
47:53 -  That cannot be offended against That cannot be offended against This is the mystery that Paul saw in Romans 11
48:02 -  This is the mystery that Paul saw in Romans 11 Oh, the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God Who has been his counselor?
48:12 -  Who has been his counselor? What is Paul celebrating? Much more than Israel's restoration
48:21 -  Much more than Israel's restoration The church's transfiguration The church's transfiguration
48:30 -  By the crisis of faith that comes to it By the crisis of faith that comes to it By the Jewish in his last extremity
48:40 -  By the Jewish in his last extremity By people who do not love their life to the death By people who do not love their life to the death
48:54 -  Who do not regard it as dear unto themselves Who do not regard it as dear unto themselves Who do not regard it as dear unto themselves
49:03 -  But live for the purpose of God Who establish the bounds of their habitation And appointed their times
49:17 -  That they might seek after God And find Him For the revelation of His purpose
49:26 -  That you might fulfill it Beyond any ability in yourself But by the power of His life
49:36 -  Released in resurrection And is now your life That's much more than being a well-intentioned Christian
49:47 -  That's much more than being a well-intentioned Christian That's much more than being a well-intentioned Christian That's becoming the thing in itself
49:56 -  To whom Jews will cling To whom Jews will cling And believe
50:05 -  And believe Because you are the message You are the thing in itself
50:14 -  You are the demonstration of the truth of the resurrection For you are its sons and daughters For you are its sons and daughters
50:23 -  I've led a number of Jews to the Lord There's one sitting on the front row here Right over the telephone
50:32 -  Who said, well, what is salvation? And I explained to her, she said, well, I'm not ready for that I said, when you are, call me
50:41 -  And she did, a short time later Right over the telephone The word of the Lord
50:50 -  There's another Jewish woman They took me to see her She was a professor at a university in Wisconsin
50:59 -  And she had lived in excruciating pain for seven years And she had lived in excruciating pain for seven years No doctor could heal her
51:08 -  No doctor could heal her That's what happens to a Jew when they practice yoga That's what happens to a Jew when they practice yoga
51:17 -  Others can, we cannot We should be a holy people unto him We're not to trifle with the worlds
51:26 -  We're not to trifle with the worlds Our sins are doubled Our sins are doubled
51:35 -  So they brought me to see her So they brought me to see her And I said to her, unrehearsed
51:44 -  What must be the magnitude of your pride What must be the magnitude of your pride That God has allowed this infirmity
51:53 -  That God has allowed this infirmity To come upon you She told me later when you said that
52:02 -  She said you like slapped me in the face I thought I was irrespectable to you I thought I was irrespectable to you
52:11 -  I never saw myself as a proud person I never saw myself as a proud person But you were showing me as God sees me
52:21 -  But you were showing me as God sees me And as I in fact am And as I in fact am
52:30 -  Because we believers walk by faith and not by sight Because we believers walk by faith and not by sight We're not impressed with externalities
52:39 -  We're not impressed with externalities And well behaved and moral and ethical Jews And well behaved and moral and ethical Jews
52:48 -  Who have it all together And don't yell at their wives the way we do And don't yell at their wives the way we do
52:57 -  They need to be saved They are the man of the year We have a choice to make
53:06 -  We have a choice to make We're either going to be impressed by what our eye sees externally Or we are going to be impressed by what our eye sees externally
53:15 -  Or we are going to be impressed by what our eye sees externally Or by what the word of God says is the condition of every Jew and every man
53:29 -  However awkwardly impressive How amazing can this be? There's no man good, no, not one
53:38 -  And if God should mock iniquity And if God should mock iniquity Who can stand?
53:47 -  The church is called to its prophetic task The church is called to its prophetic task Is to communicate things as God sees them
53:56 -  Is to communicate things as God sees them Not as men would choose them to be Not as men would choose them to be
54:05 -  We have to bring men to how God sees We have to bring men to how God sees We have to bring men to the way God sees them
54:14 -  We have to bring men to the way God sees them It's before that God that they will stand in the day of his judgment Because it is before that God that they will appear on the day of judgment
54:23 -  It's before that God that they will stand in the day of judgment Well, I can't give you my whole testimony now But I've given you two principal events of it
54:53 -  But I've given you two principal events of it One that came through a sophisticated man One that came through a sophisticated man
55:02 -  One that came through a sophisticated man Who spoke to me a piercing statement Of what the world needs
55:11 -  Of what the world needs And then a simple girl Demonstrating to me in my own face
55:20 -  The light of God Which I had never seen Being all my life in the darkness
55:29 -  With all my university degrees And when I recovered from her statement And when I recovered from her statement
55:38 -  I was jealous She moved me to jealousy By what was in her
55:47 -  But I had never glimpsed before Fulfilling what Paul said in Romans Fulfilling what Paul said in Romans
55:56 -  Have they stumbled they should fall? No, but through their false salvation Has come to the Gentiles
56:05 -  So as to bring them to So as to bring them to Make them jealous of the Jews
56:17 -  Well I spent some weeks in Egypt I spent some weeks in Egypt
56:26 -  With the Jewish community there at that time I saw Orthodox Judaism I saw Orthodox Judaism
56:35 -  And its inadequacy All religion is inadequate As we took a train
56:44 -  Into southern Egypt Crowded with peasant people Crowded with peasant people
56:53 -  So we had not a place to sit Coming back we were the first ones in the compartment We came to the next station
57:02 -  We came to the next station And the poor people were pressing to come in And the poor people were pressing to come in
57:11 -  This Jewish brother said Keep the door closed Keep your seat
57:20 -  There's not enough for all I thought to myself Reasonable
57:29 -  It's not generous But what God is asking Not just to move over and make room
57:41 -  But to give up your seat To give up your life That's more than religion
57:50 -  It's the sacrificial nature Of what God is in himself To those who are his
57:59 -  To those who are his So where does God finish his work with me? Of course in Jerusalem
58:08 -  Of course in Jerusalem Where my trip journey ended And I was at the Hebrew University
58:17 -  Being supplied with books By a Jewish friend Books that explained why I didn't have to become a Christian
58:26 -  Books that explained why I didn't have to become a Christian That didn't help I couldn't split out the hook
58:35 -  The Lord was reeling me in I was flipping and flopping Well the last thing I was going to visit
58:44 -  An orthodox Jewish community I would see real Judaism I would see real Judaism
58:53 -  And I was willing I wanted to split out the hook Can I help it if he put me on the wrong bus?
59:05 -  And find myself lost in Jerusalem Going in circles And I got out of the bus
59:14 -  Walked into the first store that I could find I asked the woman for instructions She graciously gave them to me
59:23 -  Because I was about to leave I realized I'm in a bookstore I took a closer look
59:32 -  Bibles, Christian commentaries New testaments I turned again to this Jewish woman
59:41 -  What is this place I am in? She said, what is this place? She said, we are Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus
59:50 -  She said, we are Jewish believers in the Messiah Jesus This is our bookstore joining our chapel This is our bookstore joining our chapel
59:59 -  Something clicked in my heart And I heard a voice I could tell you exactly what he said
01:00:08 -  Calling me by name Art You are not to leave
01:00:17 -  I was being commanded By the holy one of Israel himself As a man who had never submitted to any of us
01:00:26 -  I stayed four days and nights I stayed four days and nights Jews with their hands above their heads
01:00:35 -  Jews with their hands above their heads And with tears coming down their faces And as their sleeves were pulled back
01:00:44 -  The tattooed numbers from the concentration camp Worshipping Jesus Worshipping Jesus
01:00:53 -  In unfamed faith and love This is not a performance And opening to me the scriptures
01:01:02 -  What, the plan of salvation? I couldn't understand it I went to sleep the last night perplexed
01:01:11 -  I went to sleep the last night perplexed Unable to understand By the power of my intellect
01:01:20 -  And in my sleep The spirit of God put understanding in my heart The spirit of God put understanding in my heart
01:01:29 -  I woke up on May 26, 1964 Believing Believing
01:01:38 -  And able to call on the name of the Lord And able to call on the name of the Lord And the salvation that has remained to this day
01:01:47 -  And I came back to California A saved man The God whom I was not seeking
01:02:05 -  The God whom I was not seeking The God whom I was not seeking The God whom I was not seeking
01:02:14 -  Had sought for me Had sought for me And I couldn't understand why
01:02:23 -  And I couldn't understand why I lost all my friends the first night back I was invited to a welcoming party
01:02:32 -  And you know when intellectuals and Jews get together The words were flying everywhere And I was strangely silent
01:02:41 -  The Jewish woman turned to me finally She said, why are you so silent? Usually in the thick of these discussions
01:02:50 -  I said, I know, but I find this discussion completely irrelevant to life I was seeing through new eyes
01:02:59 -  Hearing through new ears They were involved with trifles Oh she said, well what do you think is relevant?
01:03:08 -  I thought, uh oh, here it comes I'm not ready for this Lord I'm too young in the faith
01:03:17 -  I don't know how to express it I don't know how to express it I don't know how to express it
01:03:26 -  I'll make a mess of it It's every thought that you will have When the appointed moment comes
01:03:35 -  The God who has appointed The balance of your habitations And your time
01:03:44 -  Will require you to open your mouth And I did And I did
01:03:53 -  And he filled it I lost every friend one night By my testimony
01:04:02 -  Only one Jewish brother did not forsake me And him, the Lord saved On his living room floor
01:04:11 -  That he carried a picture of Jesus And his father He carried a picture of Jesus
01:04:20 -  When he died, when his life ended Finally they invited me to give my testimony Finally they invited me to give my testimony
01:04:29 -  And what's that? Look, share what happened to you So I shared in the community where I'd been a priest
01:04:38 -  And one could hear a pin drop And it was a holy silence People came up to me afterwards
01:04:48 -  And then an ordinary woman Nothing distinctive What we call a roly poly
01:04:57 -  Kind of chubby She said, you don't know me, Brother Katz Brother Katz
01:05:06 -  Brother Katz But you had my daughter in your history class But my daughter
01:05:15 -  She attended her history class at the university And she knew that you were an atheist and a radical And she knew that you were an atheist and a radical
01:05:24 -  And came home from school every afternoon Weeping over you And she, my daughter, came home every day
01:05:33 -  Weeping over you And she said, since that day We haven't stopped praying for you
01:05:42 -  And the Lord gave me an elbow in my ribs He said, she's the one She's the one
01:05:51 -  Whose prayers have entered you into the kingdom of God Her prayers have entered you into the kingdom of God I am eternally indebted
01:06:00 -  I am eternally indebted To a gentle woman Who had never laid eyes on me
01:06:09 -  Who had never laid eyes on me But prayed And the effectual prayers of righteous men and women avail much
01:06:18 -  And the effectual prayers of righteous men and women avail much To pursue a man To pursue a man through the nation
