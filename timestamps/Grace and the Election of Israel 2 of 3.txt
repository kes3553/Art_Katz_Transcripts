Grace and the Election of Israel 2 of 3

00:00 -  Okay, we're continuing to look at the Church and an understanding, a definition of the Church, the mystery of God, that the Church itself fails today to recognize and understand not itself. It's something like we've often said that we need to have another factor for our own
00:40 -  identification. We don't understand maleness independent of female or female independent of male. The Church cannot understand itself independent of Israel and Israel ultimately cannot understand itself except the relationship with the Church. There is a reciprocity in the duality of
00:59 -  these things so the Church is lacking this recognition and doesn't really understand itself or its purpose because it has been separated from the other. It has chosen that separation and men like Constantine early in the Church's history have facilitated that removing Jewish
01:21 -  consciousness, removing acknowledgement of Jewish feast days, removing the acknowledgement of the Shabbat and many other kinds of things and the institutionalizing of Christianity has been a conscious movement away from its Hebraic origins and roots to the disfigurement of the Church
01:44 -  itself until it has become so exclusively a Gentile phenomenon and an institution rather than an organism that it is incapable of moving Jews to jealousy. What God would have intended as moving Jews to jealousy mainly the revelation of the Hebraic faith through Gentiles has been lost to
02:08 -  men as the Church has moved farther away from its root. In this one sense the Church of this particular dispensation marks a provisional period, a time of predominantly Gentile election designed to move the Jew to jealousy. The Church as a spiritual organism includes the elect of all
02:37 -  ages. Listen to how far back Mecci goes. The Church is not just what had its advent at the time after Christ's death but it's the elect of all ages, the corporate seed of the woman and the seed of Christ and the Spirit are all redeemed by the same once and for all sacrifice and cannot be
03:01 -  limited to this dispensation but are part of a more comprehensive and eternal purpose to gather into one all things in Christ which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all. The Church is an organism made up of all the seed of the Spirit as God is not the God of the dead
03:23 -  but of the living. The purpose of God to gather all things in Christ is a purpose that spans the dispensations through what Reggie is getting at here is a dispensational mentality that sees the advent of the Church from the day of Pentecost and therefore separate from a different from its
03:43 -  Hebraic origins. Reggie is saying no, that the organism spans the generation. He's the God of the living. The saints of all ages are incorporated into the phenomenon that we call the Church. Unto him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end.
04:04 -  I've used that scripture again and again throughout all ages to think of the future of that reality but I have not thought of the scripture throughout all ages as including the past of all ages. Reggie sees this unbroken continuum of the remarkable phenomenon that we label Church having its origin
04:24 -  through all ages the faithful of all ages. The eternal purpose in Christ constitutes the end and goal of all of the provisional dispensations and covenants. However, the eternal phenomenon of Christ and the Church embracing all ages past and future was a mystery unknown until its
04:45 -  revelation to the first century apostles and prophets and there's a wonderful footnote that the reality is there but the revelation of the understanding of the reality has been a more recent phenomenon since the advent of Christ. Here's the footnote we must be careful not to
05:02 -  conclude that because something is recently revealed that it is necessarily newly existent. There's a tremendous We must be careful not to conclude that because something is recently revealed that it is
05:20 -  necessarily newly existent. The revelation of it could be recent but the reality is ancient. How could the mystery of the Church have been known prior to the revelation of the mystery of Christ and of the gospel? Indeed such could not be revealed until after the Son of Man
05:38 -  be risen. Therefore just as both Christ and the gospel existed before the time of full revelation so the Church as a spiritual entity had real organic existence even before it could be revealed in its full character as the body of Christ. In a word it was kind of a pre-existent Church
05:57 -  a pre-existent body. In Ephesians Paul talks about being joined to the body. The body did not have its formation with Gentiles being brought into the faith but they were brought into an already existing body an organism that has a continuum going all throughout the salvation
06:15 -  history of God. The German term that we don't have in English because the German see this cosmic faith in its origin going back into creation and into the eschatological future. That's what Reggie is fingering here. Until then the children of the Spirit can only be known by such designations as
06:39 -  quote the assembly of the righteous the circumsides of heart the Godly seed of rendering. Indeed the very language of such a distinction as the body of Christ could not have been used until the revelation of the mystery of Christ in the gospel neither of which had their origins in the first
06:54 -  century. Very important point and simply because the recognition has come more recently should not be the grounds by which we will dismiss the origin and the history and the unbroken continuum of what we have come to call the Church. See what I mean? The language is a Johnny come lately language
07:15 -  that waited on the advent of Jesus himself the body of Christ but the organism and the body of self before it had that label and designation already existed. What an understanding for the Church that it's not a Johnny come lately phenomenon. Its terminology might be but its reality
07:36 -  has its origins all the way back into the historic past and what a distinction it's one with Israel in that identity and now its function is to bring back into that identity those natural Jews who have been broken off from it and wait for the Church's testimony and witness
07:56 -  to move them to jealousy to be part again of what was theirs from the first. It's a whole different conception of what we are as the Church. I looked up the Hebrew word before the word Church came from ecclesiast from ecclesia the Greek would have been called out. The Hebrew word for congregation
08:21 -  or community of believers is the Kahila and even the word Kahal the root of it means come together or assembly or congregation even the word preacher is Koholet is one who speaks of the things of God to the congregation so there's a Hebrew word which when they
08:47 -  when the new when the Septuagint came and the New Testament out of the Greek translated this Kahila or the word ecclesia which became the word church and so that the Church the word that we use has lost its original connotation and flavor and therefore we see it as something
09:08 -  independent from and unrelated to its Yiddish origins and that's the way the Jews see it and that's where Satan would like for them to see it. The Church is some kind of gentile unrelated phenomenon and not in any way the continuation of the Kahila of God of the
09:25 -  congregation and the assembly of the faithful of all generations. How much better for the Church to understand itself as that and to use the word in its unspoken connotations as being something institutional something apart something separate from something unrelated to
09:44 -  the is the faithful of Israel of all generations. It was commonly understood from prophecy that all nations would benefit and be blessed as a result of Israel's national regeneration in that day when a nation would be born at once.
10:02 -  It was not known however that the covenant of regeneration would be extended to elect gentiles before the time of Israel's national deliverance. Instead of the nations being blessed with the overflow of Israel's millennial glory as well
10:17 -  known from prophecy the revelation of the mystery hidden other ages means that the gentiles are unexpectedly included in the covenant that regeneration ratified in the size of coming death and this not a result of Israel's restoration but during the time of national judgment and
10:34 -  blindness. There was there was an expectation that nations would be blessed the gentiles would be blessed but when at the time of Israel's final eschatological restoration and glory but what Reggie is saying is what was not understood as the mystery that before that time
10:53 -  there would already be a segment or remnant of gentiles coming into the blessedness of Israel even before Israel's own restoration and regeneration. During this temporary blindness and judgment the face of God is hidden from the elect nation
11:14 -  and a remnant for not predominantly gentile is blessed in their place as foretold by Moses in Deuteronomy 31-33 and through by Jesus in Matthew 21. This is the great anomaly of history and is calculated to drive the apostate nation to jealousy. So again it's another expression
11:33 -  salvation has come before Israel's eschatological return but what's the purpose of that preliminary bringing of gentiles in to the faith of the God of Israel that it is God's very provision and device for the eschatological restoration of Israel. It is God's salvific
11:56 -  agent where the fullness of the gentiles be come in so all Israel shall be saved as it is written. The deliverer shall come out of Zion and take transgression from Jacob according to the covenant that I have made from the plot. When does that take place? When the fullness of the gentiles
12:16 -  be come in. Israel's restoration is inextricably linked with something that must come through the church so that the church becomes this remnant of gentiles that have been brought into the Israel of God will by its conduct and demonstration and mercy restore Israel or release the deliverer
12:41 -  to restore. He waits for something and those who've heard me speak in Psalm 102 and I mentioned it earlier when his servants shall have compassion on her dust and mercy on her stones the deliverer will come and restore Zion. It's never what Zion does it's never what Israel does
13:05 -  because Israel will be totally incapacitated. How come? Because Israel is the epitome of self-sufficiency. Israel is the statement of the world. Israel is man in his own ability to establish himself and perform and make his own righteousness establish his own nation
13:24 -  obtain his own salvation that's why they have to be utterly reduced under dry bones incapable of anything so that there's any restoration any return it's not something that could come out of Israel's own conduct or life it has no life it's death it must be something then that comes to it
13:44 -  from outside of itself through what instrumentality through the church that sees itself in such identification with that Israel and is not ashamed of her sin for it knows that while it was yet sinners God saved it and therefore they could relate to Israel while yet in her sin in the
14:06 -  certain way that God related to it while it was in its sin and instead of being contentious of Israel now under judgment as all the world is taking delight in Israel's reduction that the service when my servants shall have compassion on her stones and pity on her dust there's deliver
14:28 -  will come forth and deliver Zion the Lord is content has limited himself he has restricted himself and the only thing that can release him to be the deliver that comes out of Zion is what happens through the church and the fullness of the Gentiles because what does that mean
14:48 -  yes the full number of a people for his name from all nations but is it only a numeric thing no is it only a quantitative thing or is he waiting for a qualitative thing yes something of the change of the character of the church from its stubborn egocentrism and into this broken
15:10 -  shattered humble church that is only too grateful for its salvation even if it has come from eating the crumbs off of Israel's table and sees itself in relationship with a nation now that is more despised more than any man at the end of the age because it's got to work the Lord's road to
15:29 -  Calvary it will be marked more than any man there'll be no beauty that any should desire it who's going to take them in who's going to extend mercy who's going to see that this despised people are his brother and who are hungry thirsty naked and in prison and come to them and take them in
15:47 -  at the risk of their own lives to suckle this people who are hated as the enemies of mankind who have caused the oil crisis who started a war in the middle east that has affected the economy of all nations because of the intractability because they're unwilling to compromise because
16:03 -  they couldn't agree to terms of peace because because because because and and that this is really a conspiracy to take over the world that has always been the Zionist intention of Jews who's going to resist that kind of inflammatory bitter vitriolic hatred that is demonically
16:22 -  inspired and will be rife and poured out over the earth like a bilge are you those who have this faint humanistic and sentimental love to Israel think it's so cute will be the first ones to fall only the love of God that cannot be offended cannot dissipate it's as resolute as he himself is
16:43 -  and cannot be offended will continue and continue in a way that will motivate the church to take them in at the risk and cost of its own life and if that doesn't move Jews to jealousy I don't know what else will what you're willing to risk your children your family your safety you're willing
17:03 -  to go to a concentration camp because of me you're willing to to be tortured and be imprisoned and die what did I ever do for you you don't understand brother I counted a privilege if the Lord will require that we anticipated your coming we love you because you're the chosen one the Lord and
17:25 -  we can't wait for the day that you shall return to Zion with mourning and signing fleeing away and everlasting joy upon your heads when we come to the privilege to be God's instrument in preserving you physically and releasing you spiritually if that doesn't move them to jealousy
17:43 -  I can't think of any demonstration that will and that's why God was sifted through all nations because all nations must have the opportunity either to receive or to reject this displaced exilic people as being the brethren of the Lord and deserving our compassion and our mercy
18:02 -  or because we're so caught in ourselves and concerned for our own safety and want to avoid fear and exposure that will avoid them the true church will have its identity and its revelation in response to Jews in the in the last days extremely if we think that this qualitative
18:22 -  fullness is learning Israeli choruses and dancing the aura and wearing a star of David and other kinds of external schnicklock we're missing it what God is wanting is a much deeper phenomenon and not so much Jewish or Israeli as it is hebraic because what is hebraic is what God
18:42 -  is essentially in his own person he's the root of the tree and when that character issues from the wife and that's some adaptation or cultural embrace of something God will have a thing that he's after the irony is that if we're satisfied with the cultural facsimile thereof and a little
19:05 -  Yiddish kite we actually preclude the possibility of the actuality of that which is hebraic I'm not glad that's going to take did you get that our satisfaction with a cultural facsimile of Jewishness of Israeli identification of choruses however lovely they may be in themselves
19:27 -  can actually keep us from the the realization of the spiritual reality that can be described as hebraic that will be the fullness of the gentiles we've come in it'll be so full you'll not be recognized as gentiles anymore in fact you're not to the Israel of God in fact more
19:46 -  hebraic than Jews who ironically are more boyish than you are even when they avoid milk with meat like my mother that their mentalities are Greek and man-centered and the system of values and so that is no way to break but they are generically and ethnically Jewish when they see authentic
20:09 -  hebraicness coming out of my God that demonstration is irresistible if that were not so i'd not be here today i would have been a dead man 35 years ago i was saved by that demonstration coming out of a wasp really white anglo-saxon middle-class girl from the from kansas it should have been
20:31 -  the object of my deepest contempt contempt as a superior new york jew but this simple little piece of humanity with a smell no freckle face and sandy hair exhibited the light of God out of her face and it was a light that i knew was not to be found in universities i had been there i was moved
20:52 -  to jealousy by what this little girl had artlessly and unselfishly after my spending a lifetime of intense self-consciousness seeking to find what had i was never able to paint she had by virtue of her union with my desire i was moved to jealousy there's no demonstration more powerful
21:12 -  to choose than the demonstration of their God from gentile faces and so the word gentile itself is not really an apt thing and that's the fullness that God is waiting for how do we obtain it through the cross you've got to bring to death even the yiddish kite even the cultural identification
21:32 -  even the sentimental we want the love of God that cannot be offended against then our sentiment which is a shabby substitute for that love which really delights us and warms the cockles of our hearts and gives us a kind of identification we want to enjoy has got to go we've got to bring
21:49 -  that to death i'll tell you what the death will not immediately be followed by the resurrection of his love there'll be a time of no man's land where you need to have sentiment no love and you'll be berating yourself shouldn't i have a feeling toward the jew shouldn't i what happened
22:09 -  to my identification i i seem to be lacking in any kind of what i'm dead yes until his life shall be released then you'll have his life it's our unwillingness to suffer that no man's land that keeps us hooked to the shallower and insubstantial sentimentality which will not
22:29 -  serve us in good stead in that day sentiment will go up like a puffer it's really tested when we're really required to extend mercy at the risk of our life will not have it only his love so we need to be at war against sentiment against every human kind of thing
22:45 -  that contends against the authenticity of God's grace he'll not compete with us the recent message that i brought to germany and other nations seven nations in seven weeks and john was with me for the last part of that and russia the ukraine and finland the central message
23:01 -  that the lord gave was if you're not willfully consciously and gratefully and grafted into their you cannot receive its benefit if you're going to give a hebraic fruit and that expression only out of the life that flows from the roof and not by any acculturation or external appropriation
23:26 -  only out of the natural and organic jointedness to their tree do you receive the sap of his life which is essentially hebraic but it takes more than just being technically grafted in you could be grafted in technically to your husband and be a dead branch it's only when
23:44 -  there's a willful embrace of that engrafting and a submission and a gratitude that the life that i derive at the life of my union with him will receive the benefit of what God implants and gives through the head same thing is true in the mystery of Israel and the figure that Paul uses
24:04 -  in describing the church as being grafted into their tree well why then are we fruitless why are we trying dead limbs if we're drafted in because we're not conscious of that engrafting we're not grateful for that engrafting and we have not willingly embraced that engrafting
24:23 -  and therefore we have forfeited the sap in the life that issues from that root and from that tree and leaves us ruthless it leaves us fruitless a wild olive tree by its very nature cannot ever bear fruit and we remain wild while we're yet drafted if we have not ascertained affirmed with
24:44 -  gratitude our privilege of having once been a fruitless tree now been grafted into their tree what a submission what a humbling but that that that acknowledgement requires but until it comes the life does not flow to bring forth the fruit through the all the depth of the riches both of
25:05 -  the wisdom and the knowledge of God the lord gave me that that message in germany and brandenburg where fellowship was falling apart i didn't even know the day the day before we had arrived they had a meeting they were exploding they've been going over like shrapnel like flying to pieces
25:23 -  and that was the message but with the application not only about the the affirmation of being grafted into Israel's tree but the affirmation of the members of the body being grafted and joined into its eldership and into its leadership and all the more because that tree is not always
25:42 -  externally attractive and that eldership might show forth its its defects and if you have not affirmed your joiningness you're going to lose out from the life and they came for such a place of repentance they hugged this elder who who in himself leaves much to be desired even as Israel
26:03 -  leaves much to be desired and that would be every reason why we would be ashamed to be identified with that tree but when we willfully embrace it and count the privilege we enjoy the benefit of its life and that's a principle not only for the church in its corporateness but us relationally
26:24 -  in our marriages and in the body i said to a sister in the fellowship who goes to another fellowship on sundays you may enjoy it but i want to tell you if you're going to receive the ultimate benefit that God intends for you and your family you'll only receive it in this body
26:41 -  you'll not receive it from out of it and however unattractive this body might be to you and written through with defect and the other looks the more alluring the more attractive you'll not derive life except in the body in which that is probably to be joined you need to affirm that and be grateful
27:01 -  for that and and the life will fall to you it's a great principle now now reggie takes up the question what is all this to do about Israel i just said to a God in the bathroom this message needs to go to the church and all the world yes like that's true but of course if you bring it
27:21 -  they're going to think you're just tooting your own horn edgar you're jewish and you're standing up for your own people and therefore you're in a it's a distorted message so reggie is raising a question what is the significance of if Israel's ethnicity what is the significance of Israel as a
27:42 -  jewish nation how important is that and why does God insist upon that is it because he has a bias against gentile nations where he has a disposition for favor one over another what is the issue in the necessary uniqueness and recognition of Israel for Israel's sake as being jews as being
28:03 -  that nation i recently had to address that in one of the meetings in canada at the home of one of the wealthy elders of that congregation who's from south africa and is a british Israelitist a great britain is the Israel of God and i opened up and i assure you it was not because i knew that
28:25 -  for lord and i made it on the uniqueness and the distinction of Israel as being a recognizable jewish nation and that this identity must not be obscured or set aside not because of any issue of ethnic pride but because of the issue of God's glory because the recognition of his redemptive
28:51 -  work cannot be seen except in the nation that he has appointed and is recognized by all the world as being that nation and these Jews this is an important question that's going to come up because you'll be accused of an undue attachment or affinity for jews in Israel per se as if it's
29:12 -  some kind of ethnic thing that you have a favoritism toward no the issue is not that the issue is there's something in the redemptive genius of God that will be lost unless that nation's ethnicity is recognized and maintained and one way in which it's lost is by the mistaken notion
29:34 -  well now in christ is neither jew nor gentile that may be true in a certain sense within the body of christ as the church but in the ultimate purposes of God for Israel per se as nation that is not in any way obliterated and changed God says in jeremiah that this people will remain
29:57 -  as a nation before me so long as the sun continues to give us light and the moon and the stars i i i've rooted their their persistent nationality in creation itself not because i'm i'm i'm playing favorites it's because my glory is related to the fulfillment of my salvation redemption
30:19 -  that has to be seen with them and in them in a world that recognizes them as the people Israel and as jews here's here's how ready expresses this look for the significance can possibly attach to ethnic distinctions maybe nothing presidential or partial won't we be accused of that
30:42 -  jew lovers superficiality here stems from superficiality at a much more fundamental level if the primary goal of the gospel is only to make salvation universally available why take such a circuitous route why does it have to be through Israel and Israel's restoration and Israel's
31:04 -  prophetic fulfillment and in the land and why why doesn't God just go directly to the nations and make that salvation available this fails to understand why Israel was chosen in the first place and why is the preservation of Israel's national distinction an intrinsic feature of
31:22 -  the covenant of promise and ultimately strategic to the future of divine purpose and glory here as Israel's God that waits for a fulfillment and final redemption for that nation Israel
31:46 -  it's the issue of his purpose and glory and he says in a footnote the manifestly the divine preservation of Israelisms as a distinct race is necessary in order to demonstrate that the purpose of God is indeed according to election because if you lose the distinction of Israel
32:07 -  how do you recognize who was elected and how do you see that election being fulfilled if it has become amorphous and unidentifiable it's been lost like a vapor it only makes sense and is fulfilled with the same people whom God made that covenant because it's the same people
32:23 -  whom he elected it's got to be fulfilled with them there's got to be an insistence upon Israel as and jews as jews and the nations of their salvation the distinction between jew and gentile although spiritually abolished in christ is necessarily maintained in the creation in
32:42 -  order to underscore and highlight this reigning principle namely that grace in order to be grace must be according to election this is this is nailing the nail on the head
33:05 -  thus distinguishing its true character and nature as perfectly free and sovereign in its working what does election mean and grace as identifying the God who elects and the God who's gracious in honoring covenant except it is identifiable with the nation within his first
33:25 -  name to abolish that nation it is this ethnic distinction is to remove from God the glory of what is revealed in his grace to that particular nation and that's why we as the church must be insisted and not allow ourselves to be sucked in to this misuse of scripture but aren't we all
33:48 -  one in christ there's neither now no more jews why are you majoring in Israel why you keep talking about Israel Israel is it some fetish with you is it because you're jewish yourself will you have a sentimental business no it's because the glory of God is totally caught up in the fulfillment of his
34:08 -  choice and his election his grace through covenant with that first nation with whom he has commented as it is not fulfilled with them what hope can any nation have of covenantal promise if it is not first demonstrated in the initial nation of covenant Israel it must have its
34:30 -  demonstration in a way that could be recognized by all nations or all nations are without hope where their only hope is that the God who has been gracious to Israel visibly is the God who'll equally then be gracious to him or he's not one who plays favorites or is partial Israel is only
34:48 -  the demonstration of the grace that he intends for all nations but it must be recognized in them and in their fulfillment as Israel and as the jewish people got the picture this is going to be a path and if you don't understand it will be very vulnerable many look for an end time and
35:07 -  gathering of jews to fulfill romans 11 25 to 29 but treated as something peripheral indefinite and incidental to the eschatological harvest of nations the restoration of Israel is little considered as a necessary feature of the promise intrinsic to the logic and nature of the covenant
35:27 -  of course the issue of God is at stake the issue of his glory is at stake the issue of his name as a covenant making covenant keeping God who elects a nation and will fulfill it even against the unwillingness of the nation itself to have it fulfilled
35:46 -  still he will succeed because he is God and he will have mercy upon whom have mercy and who needs it more than a failed people that's the issue not our our judio file our temperamental or sentimental affinity for jews they're not all that charming that's my life
36:08 -  but because it's the issue of God his glory his honor his name as the God who elects as the God who keeps covenant and fulfills it even against the unwillingness of the covenant partner to have it fulfilled and if he could do that with such a partner as that for what nation
36:29 -  with his covenant mercies not be Israel must be the exemplar and the statement of God in his mercy and grace to the nations and he must necessarily have one nation as the demonstration and in his chosen as he's chosen through that would not have been our choice it's his choice
36:52 -  because he chooses the thing that is least not because it's the most but because it's the least because he takes no pleasure in that which men exalt and he likes the thing that is foolish and weak and we jews are qualified perfectly you know what distinguishes an apostle and many have heard
37:12 -  me say this many times and will distinguish an apostolic church this jealousy exceeds that of its concern for Israel and its concern for itself as the church is jealousy in its animating central purpose primary to its own identification being is the glory of God forever and in order to see
37:34 -  that fulfillment this mystery spoken of in almost 9 to 11 must be fulfilled with ethnic identifiable Israel or he will have lost the prospect of his glory and for that reason we give ourselves and sacrifice not only to jews will not appreciate our extending ourselves but to other segments of
37:55 -  the church that will look upon us as being divisive as harping on on some ethnic people because God is equitable to all men he has no favorites and you're you're off tangent and etc etc so the existence of Israel provokes world confrontation isn't it something this very
38:15 -  insistence on this ethnicity and this fulfillment is going to provoke a reaction against us because the powers of the darkness hate that recognition in fact you know how they're seeking to remove it by abolishing the people of whom it speaks what is the time of jacob's trouble what are the nazi
38:33 -  concentration camps what are the last days annihilation of jews that two-thirds of whom will be devoured in this time that is your future and only a third of them is alive it's the attempt of the powers of darkness through the nations that are moved by that darkness to eliminate and
38:51 -  annihilate this particular people because the fulfillment of God's theocratic intention for all nations resides with them what he has appointed in the land and in the people is contingent and critical to the fulfillment of his whole glorious redundant scheme and therefore that reason every
39:13 -  power in hell will be bent against it against the destruction and what then will be our experience in a world so calculated against jews when we stand for them and in identification with them this may well be the precipitating factor of the last day's persecution of the church itself
39:34 -  under the anti-christ dispensation and will we be willing and i'll tell you this we will not be willing if it's only an identification with jews as jews however nice that might be in itself the only thing that will sustain us in the relentless opposition of persecution that will
39:52 -  come is our identification with jews not because they're jews but because their identity is critical to the fulfillment of God's glorious redemptive purpose we stand with them for that it's not because they're cute they're not going to be cute and every day they're less cute
40:14 -  so the existence of Israel provokes world confrontation with the sovereignty of grace through unconditional election manifesting apart from the will of man this explains why for a thousand years all nations are compelled to witness again history's most lavish demonstration
40:30 -  of distinguishing grace on this elect people what why do we have to go through a thousand year interim before there's a new heaven and a new earth that was described sunday morning in revelations chapter 21 why don't we go into that immediately with the lord's return why is
40:45 -  there an interim where the law must go forth out of zion the nations restored enjoying millennial conditions of longevity of life of blessedness where the reaper cannot keep up with the so it's because for a thousand years God is going to rub the face of the nations into the reality of
41:03 -  who he is as God that they'll get the message by the continuing existence of this nation redeemed out of death by the grace of God because though they failed to keep covenant he did not fail he will restore them because of the covenant that i have made with them they need a thousand years
41:23 -  to let it sink in and what ends the thousand years a rebel or a revolt among the nations when when the evil one is allowed out of his chains and pit to foment a rebellion against God in Israel and on the mountains of Israel and against his people one last time shows the depth
41:42 -  of the antagonism of the nations and the principalities and rulers of the nations against the election of God for that nation and even after a thousand years of millennial rule through them they still want to extinguish that nation what they will come upon us in our
