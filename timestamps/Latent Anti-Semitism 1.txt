Latent Anti-Semitism 1

00:00 -  Precious God. So we bless you. And we sense that we are at a threshold, Lord. We've not been this way here too far. There's something that you're wanting to impart, to express, to bring your church to a new sense of awareness, of consciousness in what is preparation for
00:30 -  our ultimate call, to be the saviors of Israel in the last days, so to speak. And it requires, my God, an extraordinary empathy toward this people who will not be in their best frame. Something that would be calculated to rub us raw and to make us to recoil from them,
00:53 -  they themselves will bear in their distress. So we know, my God, that the issue is not them, it's us. What we will be in that hour, how we will receive them, how we will respond, what they will see in us will be not only the issue of their survival, but the issue
01:11 -  of their salvation, that among them there will be a remnant that will return to Zion with everlasting joy upon their heads and mourning and sighing, fleeing away. That they will say that their whole final exile and being out the outcasts of Judah and the castaway of Israel was worthwhile. Like
01:36 -  the blind beggar, it was worthwhile they had regained their sight to follow you. So, my God, work with us, work in us, and bring forth in this precious congregation what you will. We thank you, Lord, for the privilege of this time. Again, we confess we don't know how to proceed. You overrule
02:00 -  anything, Lord, that I thought to employ and have your precious way as the Lord over all. Our ears are tuned to hear, Lord, what you're saying. Speak for your servants are hearing, and we thank and give you praise again for our privilege. And I'll call in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, I'm going to read
02:27 -  some Lord willing something from the messages given at Canada that began by a statement that after 38 years in the faith, I'm persuaded that anti-Jewishness is intrinsic to all Gentiles, that there's a latent anti-Semitism resident in all Gentiles. It's just the name of the game. It's
02:51 -  the very nature of the truth and what it means to be a Gentile and to have in our midst a people of a kind that are, that chafe us and are different and excite every kind of reaction toward them, being different from them and other. It's the name of the game. It's intrinsic. It's built into
03:20 -  reality itself. And the only thing that can alter that is the grace of God, the spirit of God, the converting power of God, the sanctifying work of God. Where that work is yet incomplete or partial or has been resisted, even in believers, even in spiritual believers, something of this
03:42 -  latent disposition against the Jew remains. And many of us would be shocked to be accused of either being anti-Semitic or even having the potential because we're not conscious of any rage or inflammatory thing. We would never say anything that is indecent, but there are other ways in
04:01 -  which this disposition is expressed. And until it's met in full, we cannot be to them what we ought, nor can we be a bride to the bridegroom. The two issues are one. And may the Lord show us that. And that, in fact, that it's even the Jew in God's provision for us to obtain our status
04:23 -  as a bride to the bridegroom. I want to flat out say that I'm coming to the conclusion, and I'll probably be sharing it in these days, that the Jew is God's provision for our ultimate sanctification. That there's no way that we could have attained to a bridal nature adorned for the
04:42 -  bridegroom, independent of the work, the sanctifying work that comes to us in that relationship with this most, what's the word? Most something people, most fill it in. Inflammatory, most provocative, most abusive, most offensive, most arrogant, abrasive. They are that condition for our sake.
05:14 -  They are the enemies of the gospel process for your sake. Have you ever pondered that? Who needs an enemy like that? They are an ultimate enemy, as you can only know when you seek to confront them with the gospel. If you have avoided that mandate, which is a first mandate to the Jew first, and then
05:37 -  to the Greek, you don't know the radical character of the gospel itself until you see men forming at the mouth with indignation and rage, and your audacity to presume to say to them that they need quote to be saved. Saved from what? They're not even conscious of their sin. They see themselves
05:58 -  as exemplary, and by every human measure they are. Didn't they win the B'nai B'rith Man of the Year Award? And haven't they contributed philanthropies not only to Israel, but to Gentile causes? Didn't the head of a big publishing firm in San Francisco, when I went up to his tower office in
06:17 -  the hotel which he owns, want to bribe me and say what do you want? You want a contribution to your ministry? Is that what you're angling for? I said no. I only want to tell you that your philanthropy is not going to earn you an eternal place in God. There's everything about them
06:40 -  calculated for us, and they don't even know that. It's like the wife who has to suffer living with a prophetic man who happens also to be Jewish, not realizing that that suffering is intrinsic to the differences between us and has to be born, even though being a Gentile she doesn't
07:01 -  understand the prophetic wisdom of it. You understand what I'm saying? Okay, that's the mystery of Israel and the Church. Let me read how difficult the relationship with the Jew is. You can read Michael Brown's book on their blood is on our hands. That's a classic
07:24 -  survey of all of the miscarriage of justice, of murder, mayhem, bloodshed, forced conversions, of which the Church today has little consciousness. Even if Jews do not know the particulars of that history, they know the substance of it, and they still carry it generation by generation.
07:46 -  The cross, the name Christ, the very appearance of a church. I often say a Jew will avoid allowing the shadow of the spire of a church even to fall upon him. You know that there's some Orthodox Jews who will spit when passing a church, because what is represented by that cross is not the
08:07 -  statement of atonement, but the statement of mayhem, persecution, and murder. That's what the Crusaders had on their chest, and the so-called Christians of the pogroms of the Ukraine and Russia, the seasons of persecution, have always been identified with that which is called
08:25 -  Christian. In a word, we have every card stacked against us. When we are called to break through into a new quality of relationship with this people, for our sake and for their sake, well, everything is stacked against us. Historically and in their understanding,
08:46 -  as will be expressed in this quote, of those who want no dealings with Christians at all, and Rabbi Eliezer Berkovitz, whose name I know, an outstanding theologian, Jewish theologian, very respected, Orthodox, says, what was started at the Council of Nicaea,
09:11 -  that was under Constantine, in which the rudiments of the faith were clarified and elaborated, was duly completed in the concentration camps and crematoria. At this stage, you said, it would be as immoral as it would be emotionally impossible for a sensitive, historically conscious Jew
09:34 -  to have anything to do with Christians at all. All we want of you Christians is that you keep your hands off of us and our children. If that doesn't let the air out of your balloon, I don't know what will. And the writer says, these words are hard to hear and hard to bear,
09:56 -  but hear and bear them we must, for I think for some time to come. So history has done a number that will be enormously difficult to overcome. Here's another statement by Rabbi Abraham Herschel, whose two volumes on the prophets
10:17 -  are classic and whom I had the privilege to meet years ago when I was being trained in New York City as a missionary to the Jews. Probably one of the most, if I should say, sympathetic to Christ of any of the significant Jewish voices he's now passed on, he said,
10:42 -  I had rather enter Auschwitz than be an object of conversion. I've heard Jewish mothers say to me, I'd rather see my son go to hell as a drug addict than he should subscribe to your faith. There's no way to plumb the depth of the animosity
11:05 -  against the faith that is dear to us and repulsive to them. It's going to take an extraordinary stroke from God and not just a one-time thing, a remarkable dealing of God with us to fit us somehow despite all of the historic and present difficulties to establish even a minimal
11:26 -  line of communication. Maybe we will be helped by the fact that as antisemitism becomes increasingly prevalent throughout the world, Jews will be so desperate for any kind of ally that they're willing even to consider us in our friendship. We'll have to show ourselves friendly and not
11:48 -  in any way inadvertently be clumsy and express something that will immediately trigger a reaction against us. It's a real measure of the grace of God with us and in us and for that reason we're afraid to enter their synagogues, we're afraid to establish contact, we don't know how to speak to
12:08 -  them, we're walking on eggshells and more than a Jew being turned off by anything that issues from Christians, are you saved brother? They will be more turned off by what is obsequious and condescending toward them, excuse my language, that which is stilted and making nice, oh I've
12:37 -  always loved Jews and Jews are my, I have a Jew who's my best friend and that is really icky and turns them off more than just a blunt antisemitic statement. They would have more ability and patience to hear a man who's true in his prejudice than to hear someone condescending
12:58 -  and making nice. Well Art, then how do we strike the balance? How do we deport ourselves? Well there's no rule, there's no way how to, it's the truth of what you are in Christ that's at stake, for he is made unto us wisdom, sanctification, redemption and power and you've never been tested
13:18 -  on the truth of that in the ultimate test that the Jew represents and that's why we're slack. So I'm encouraging the church to make its contact with the Jews of its own locality who are positioned there for our sake. The Lord has seen to their wide distribution in the judgment that has come
13:39 -  to them, that has cast them into all nations and will increasingly cast them, but they're there where we are, that we will be tested to see if we are taking the Lord seriously in the mandate that has come to the church to the Jew first and also to the Greek and because we have voided that mandate
13:59 -  and have avoided that people knowing that they constitute such an ultimate challenge to us, we have not been to the Greeks what we ought. Well had we gone to the Jew first of necessity, we would have had to learn what Paul knew, that this gospel is the power of God unto salvation
14:16 -  to the Jew first. The message itself does not commend it intellectually, it is not respectable, it is not rational, it is absurd actually, it's a piece of foolishness and it's a calculated piece of foolishness that God has laid aside his deity, come down to earth
14:37 -  as an infant, totally independent, doing doo-doo in his diapers like us, to take upon the humiliation of a human form and to live 30 years in obscurity and have a shot in the pan, three and a half year public ministry that will end with his excruciating death as a criminal outside of the city
15:02 -  in the garbage dump between criminals and that's our Messiah, our King, rightly was he mocked in three languages with the sign over his head, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, ha ha ha and taunted and mocked even in his suffering unto death. This is so despicable, this is so outlandish
15:22 -  this is so uncommendable, how do you dare have the presumption and the arrogance to come to a Jew with that message whose moral life is more exemplary than your own and whose English and education and erudition is more impressive than your own, you're going to
15:41 -  come to him with your high school dropout English and your inadequate spirituality and bring a message of that kind? It's suicide, it's intimidation, it's mortification and for that reason we have resisted it but you know what we have signal to the powers of the air overhead
16:03 -  these people say Lord, Lord and their choruses are full of adoring phrases with regard to Jesus the Lord but when the rubber hits the road and the Lord gives a mandate to the Jew first we have not obeyed it, that's why the powers of the air say Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you?
16:22 -  We're not obliged in any way to take you seriously so long as we see that the language of the faith is only a phrase your logical thing because when it comes to the issue of actual obedience to the Lord you have failed and you continue to fail and you're not even at all in any way distressed
16:42 -  over that failure so how shall we take you seriously? See there's a great drama you guys this is cosmic and the Jew is at the heart of it and the Lord in his wisdom has established the whole thing have the faith of the son of God for he believes and knows that he will yet prevail
17:02 -  even with the church of the kind that we are can you believe in fact he must prevail with the kind of church that we are for that itself is the wisdom of God that is contrary to the wisdom of the powers of the air but out of the mouths of babes and sucklings has he perfected praise it
17:21 -  must come out of the makeshift not the nothing composition that the church is that is not prestigious as the Jewish community is that is not as learned that is not as powerful that is not as wealthy that that the triumph of Christ must come as it was displayed at the cross in foolishness
17:43 -  and in weakness there's a drama you guys though I don't have a word for it a saga it's an immense overwhelming thing and it ends the age when that foolish thing in which God has trusted and given his spirit and his word and his ministers his prophets and his apostles his
18:04 -  evangelists pastors and teachers that they will be brought to the place of an obedience and a fulfillment by which Israel shall be redeemed and the church transfigured and to be raised up in a glorified body to be with its Lord as bride to the bridegroom and
18:25 -  everlasting righteousness in the new heaven and new earth well to contrast the two Jews that I've just read where a man would rather go to Auschwitz than to be converted and imagine I was brought up to meet that man I don't I don't know that I even
18:41 -  said boo precious weighty prestigious man scholar you you read the prophets and see if you can follow him in Greek and Latin and French and German and all of the quotes and that he cites the breadth of his understanding is astonishing as well as his insight into prophetic phenomenon itself
19:06 -  so I was a piece of foolishness against the Jew who represents what Jews themselves celebrate the wisdom of this world here's a statement by Dietrich Bonhoeffer everybody know who he is was everybody know who he is was who died a week before the end of World War II hung by the Nazis
19:30 -  for his collaboration with a plot to assassinate Hitler who could have remained in New York or in London or other places of safety but came back to Germany because he felt that unless he was with his own nation and church in that nation in the time of ultimate Nazi peril how can he be to that
19:51 -  nation after the war what he might but he never made it but what he wrote and what he what he learned in those days is one of the great contributions to the church if you've not read the book life together it's a classic that must be in every believer's library and more on the
20:11 -  library right on their nightstand and continually being read and internalized and walked out of here's what he wrote when he was in a prison cell in 1943 before his death my thoughts and feelings seem to be getting more and more like the Hebrew scriptures and no wonder I have been
20:34 -  reading it much more than the new for the last few months it is only when one knows the ineffability of the name of God ineffable means cannot be spoken that one can utter the name of Jesus Christ no remarkable statement for a German Christian so much in keeping with my own
20:55 -  painful early time as a newly saved Jewish man in my Pentecostal assembly in California hearing the name of Jesus on everyone's lips Jesus Jesus Jesus the Lord I had not come out of an out of an orthodox background that refuses even to spell the word
21:13 -  God God but omits the O and puts a hyphen as a statement of respect for God that's why the orthodox use the word Hashem the name because you don't speak the name you just refer to the name only the high priest once in the year on Yom Kippur could speak the name known only to him by
21:33 -  mystery and revelation when he made atonement for the sins of Israel otherwise who knows how to say Yod Hei Vov Hei the four consonants called the Tetra Gametan it could be pronounced as Yahweh Jehovah what is the authentic pronunciation I don't know and they don't know and in a certain
21:54 -  sense they don't think it's even rightful to know or to probe beyond what God himself would reveal but we Christians Jesus Jesus Lord Lord God God So what is he saying here he finds himself in his prison cell I don't think that that
22:13 -  should be ignored there's something about prison cells waiting execution that prepares a soul for a depth of understanding of God of eternity and of ultimate issues of truth and reality that nothing else will provide there's not been a Christian who has ever been put into a cell who
22:33 -  has not received the benefit you have only to read Richard Von Braun's testimony that he cherishes his 13 years in solitary confinement he would not exchange it for anything for the revelation that came to him in that place where he's cut off even from daylight and for communion
22:53 -  and fellowship with human beings that he received at that time such a sense of the Lord as the Lord for which there could be no price and he not at all season does not see himself as a victim but as a privileged man for that experience and everything that issued from him after that has
23:11 -  continued to bless the church so here's another soon-to-be martyr speaking out of his prison cell in 1943 my thoughts and feelings seem to be getting more and more like the Hebrew scriptures I have been reading it much more than the new for the last few months and he was a New Testament
23:31 -  scholar it is only when one knows the ineffability of the name of God when you know that it cannot be uttered it's too holy to take to your lips that one can utter the name of Jesus Christ don't utter don't don't don't merchandise in that name as if it's a reflex action and you can speak it at will
23:53 -  at will unless you have first experienced the sense of the ineffability of the name of God the one tempers the other the Old Testament exposure tempers your understanding of the new but to avoid the Old Testament is to leave yourself crippled in the appreciation of the new
24:15 -  so there's a remarkable there's something about a cracking gun it is only when one loves life and the earth so much that without them everything would be
24:35 -  gone that one can believe in the resurrection of the new world that's a remarkable statement and here's a man imprisoned facing impending death when one loves life and the earth have you noticed in the Old Testament and in the Psalms remarkable and frequent references
24:54 -  to God as creator I always wondered why is that always being put before us in the Psalms we're always being reminded of God as creator of the heavens and the earth and all that in them is is part of the great sense of the majesty and the splendor of God that is breathed out
25:12 -  of the of the Old Testament scriptures that does not have as much place in the new because the new serves other purposes the new presumes that you are as familiar with the old and therefore it's not a competition or a rivalry but there's a certain breadth of the grandeur of God that is
25:32 -  given to us in the Psalms and and in the prophets and other places even in the law itself of Moses that is not to be found in the new but God forbid that you should have neglected that and come to the new as if the original is passe and you can get everything that you need out of the
25:51 -  new exclusively it's one unbroken continuum and it needs to be understood and that's what he's seen in the prison cell it's the sense of God as creator the whole majesty of the earth and and the significance of life the sacrament of life the wholeness of life
26:11 -  that I can believe in resurrection and a new world did he not believe it before being a new testament scholar and a pastor and of course he believed it but the depth of that belief has been enhanced by his prison experience in which he finds that there's a solace and a comfort
26:30 -  and an impartation of a certain kind that is coming to him now increasingly out of the old testament so here it is side by side in the same book Dietrich Bonhoeffer saying that and the Jewish commentators saying quite the opposite and somehow we are suspended betwixt and between
26:50 -  well let me try to summarize what the Lord gave me to begin in Canada the third message that concluded that was so controversial I'll say for the end but let me let me give it to you as it began remembering that the Lord had given me the experience of visiting a synagogue in Spokane
27:10 -  and what it what an experience that was I want I don't know that I can call it an experience that was I want I don't know that I can call it holy but it was a sense of Jewish life Jewish community Jewish respect Jewish feast days
27:35 -  something that we lack in our own experience and and I coveted that we would have photographs on on our hallway walls that show the unbroken continuum of our faith and our relationships of people who have
27:55 -  stayed together and that their children us not only bar mitzvah there they're subsequently married if it goes on long enough they'll yet be buried there it is you need to go to Brooklyn and visit the Hasidim the Lubavitcher Hasidim the ultra-orthodox who have moved out from
28:16 -  their long island dwellings and other places of luxury and comfort to move into a black ghetto why because that's where their synagogue is and you can only walk to the synagogue on the Shabbat you cannot drive the drive would be to work and in fact if even the walk is too long
28:36 -  you have somehow violated the Shabbat I'm not saying that to endorse such views I'm saying that to show the mentality of this people who are willing to sacrifice a life of comfort a life of comfort and seclusion in the suburbs to come into a ghetto why because there are
28:53 -  available the brownstone houses and dilapidated tenement buildings that are cheap and and can be bought because for them the issue of proximity to each other and the place of worship is more important than suburban comfort that puts us to shame it's like my sharing about community and the
29:14 -  privilege of morning prayer times which for me are more dear than I can say that if I travel the thing that I miss most are the morning prayer times no two have ever been alike always choice always something from the Lord always precious and a brother would come after me after it's a
29:31 -  art I really delight I would love to enjoy what you're describing but I live so far out that there's no way that I could meet with believers with whom I'm joined on Sunday for a morning prayer time what do you recommend art move
29:51 -  give up your little nest what's your what's the more important value your your suburban lifestyle or proximity to the saints that you can be in the place of prayer daily these Jews put us to shame in that kind of zeal that that accounts for their sacrifice
30:11 -  something to pray about the Lord has given me a 30-year relationship and a history I've been in that community in and out in fact I had a previous invitation to spend three months with them that never materialized but it's still a live option so pray for that as there in Brooklyn also that the
30:31 -  Lord will call for that okay now I'm coming from this the Lord's stirring my heart about the synagogue the Jewish life what is represented there and its isolation from from the church and from Christians
30:53 -  and my first statement that I make to this conference in Canada is anti-Jewishness is intrinsic to all Gentiles by the very nature of things you need to recognize that in your deeps unless the sanctifying work of God and the cross has met it it's latent and there in fact by the
31:16 -  end what was latent surfaced and so I mean this is a kind of lecture which of which I was accused of lacking anointing and the deepest circumcision of the heart because I'm giving reasons why it is that it's in the nature of all things that Gentiles would harbor have as intrinsic an anti-Jewishness
31:45 -  because Jews themselves are exclusive and we are always offended by those who are separate from ourselves and want to maintain that separation it makes you question about yourself why what do they find offensive in us right away the your furrows up Jewish exclusiveness of course
32:07 -  came out of be separate and come out from the Canaanite culture civilization and religion and keep kosher keep a sanctity to be separate what God wanted to maintain and the integrity of Israel hardened into a kind of system officiated over by rabbis and elaborated in
32:34 -  the rabbinical way to become an isolation from the Gentile world rather than a witness so much so that Peter himself would never have responded to the invitation from that Roman Cornelius Cornelius except he first had a vision he had to have a what was it a
33:01 -  it was more than a dream it was a trance a trance in which he saw a sheet coming down with unclean animals and God saying Peter take and eat but Lord you know that I've never eaten anything unclean the problem for those who wanted to Haitian the execution of Jesus
33:23 -  was the requirement to come into the court of Gentiles where Pontius Pilate presided and not be themselves desecrate themselves before the holiday of the Passover you mean they were fastidious to keep themselves inviolate from from coming into the presence of a Gentile
33:43 -  in order to affect Jesus's death but did not think that the death itself was a violation so much for Pharisaical not just Pharisaical Judaism but Pharisaical religion so Jewish exclusiveness Gentile envy imagined or real the social cultural and economic
34:07 -  superiority of Jews that is visible works as a factor to inculcate a kind of antipathy toward Jews who of us can sit in the classroom with some Jewish students who get straight A's without a bead of sweat and we're breaking our heads to pass what is it what do they have if you can bless
34:27 -  them in their success you're a superb saint otherwise you'll resent their success and whether you're conscious of that or not there's something that has taken place in the course of time that works to give us a disposition against them we need to recognize these things and that's why the
34:48 -  Lord had me to state them they represent or depict the imagined wrathful God of the Old Testament as a God of judgment to be feared and Israel as the rod of God unto annihilation of the Canaanites I don't know if you've ever thought that this has been an offense to
35:10 -  even German theologians and who's the one German philosopher I think he died as a suicide who was anti-Jewish somebody help me who who
35:32 -  hated the Old Testament did dislike Paul and he thought that even Christianity was too Judaic because it entreated believers to the walk of humility rather than an assertion of our manhood in a heroic way his model was Greek not Hebraic and was offended even by a Christianity
35:55 -  seemed to suggest a Hebrew influence but these men in reading the Old Testament reading how God used Israel out of slavery and out of its 40 years in the wilderness to excise out these Canaanite civilizations and leave not a man woman or child and to actually extinguish these corrupt
36:16 -  civilizations strikes a note of fear that these Jews are still with us and have the same enmity now for us as they had once carried against the gentiles of Canaan they may seem to be acting civilly that's only because they're weak and because they're in the minority but given the
36:37 -  opportunity they would say to us off with their heads now that may be more real than imagined but at any rate it's a fear and a negative note that keeps gentiles looking at Jews with a degree of suspicion apprehension and fear just from the Old Testament
36:58 -  text even though the present-day Jew had has no correspondence to that at all it's a factor that needs to be recognized and if the Jewish superiority over the gentile the word goyim which means g-o-y-i-m literally the Hebrew for nations any nation other than Israel
37:24 -  are the nations of the goyim but when it's spoken by a Jew there's a little tincture if not little of contempt and disdain there's a sense of Jewish superiority that we have exhibited that rubs a gentile the wrong way their rejection of Christ two thousand years later still rejecting
37:49 -  Christ and Christianity raises the question of whether or not they are right in that rejection and maybe we are wrong their continued resistance to the truth of our faith raises questions as to the absoluteness of that faith can we have that confidence how is it that
38:06 -  they have been able to live that long and survive yet being in unbelief and in Christ rejection and prospering doesn't that raise a question that well maybe we got it wrong and I want to tell you that from my experience at a Lutheran seminary this is now being openly expressed that the Jews
38:25 -  may have it right and we need to consider whether in fact Christ really is the Messiah because as they say if he came where's the world peace that Messiah should have brought we know that those questions can be answered but they are troubling questions and for the
38:40 -  those that are weak in their faith or only nominal Christians it can rattle their cage and make them resistant and hostile to a Jews who seem to live quite successfully without our Christ it raises the question of the truth of our of the absoluteness of our faith
39:03 -  and for those that are weak in the faith the nominal faith as I'm saying it could be a point of antagonism This was Luther's concern and incited Luther to his ultimate powerful anti-semitism that the Jews
39:21 -  and the Talmud contained references to Jesus of a kind that were not only uncomplimentary but blasphemous they have since been removed but at that time no Jew ever thought that a Gentile no Jew ever thought that a Gentile would be looking into the Talmud but what happened in
39:39 -  the age of enlightenment about the time of Luther was that many men were now studying Hebrew and were able themselves to read directly into the Jewish sources and see these anti-Christ references that have since been expunged for example if how could Jesus be born with an
40:02 -  immaculate conception to a virgin that's patent foolishness nothing in life or nature or reality can in any way sustain that so the only way that reasonable men can explain such a birth and conception is that it must be illegitimate and so the name Jesus was not used in the Talmud
40:24 -  but a name that the rabbis coined and another name for Miriam as the one who bore him making clear illusion that they understood that birth to be a piece of illegitimacy and that the Christians had been duped to believe that that was some kind of hokey no hands miracle of a
40:47 -  what's the word that was just used immaculate conception not knowing their own scripture that unto us a child is born unto us is given a son is given that's that's the conclusion to which rational men will come when they themselves do not see the evidence in the in the Gentiles around
41:06 -  them of of the reality as to the truth of that birth so Luther saw the Jewish community as a dangerous threat to the Reformation for even in their silence they were making a testimony that they did not subscribe to the truth of the virgin birth of Jesus and that the only alternative
41:25 -  to that would be then to believe that he was illegitimate can you see the tension that's why Jesus wept over Jerusalem he knew that when we missed the day of our visitation and and our peace that this would necessarily follow the destruction of our temple the destruction of Jerusalem and
41:48 -  the casting out into the nations of this Jewish people who would always be an awkward untoward presence in their Gentile midst and would always excite envy resentment bitterness suspicion and bring upon their heads periodically particularly in the Easter season when the cry of Christ killer
42:10 -  would come Jewish death you know in the Middle Ages Jews were compelled to attend debates between the local priest and the rabbi over the issue of the truth of Christ and if they dared fall asleep they were poked with long poles to keep awake that in the hearing of this debate it would
42:31 -  be straightened out for them you need to understand the what's the word invidious unhappy the position that they occupied which was part of the judgment of the rejection of Christ himself but nevertheless had to be born without explanation you know about the crusaders on the way to the
42:57 -  holy land exploiting and pillaging every Jewish community and group in order to provide proof terror and intimidation the finances by which their expedition could be made in the town that I loved in Germany more than any other Esslingen that it looks like it goes back to
43:16 -  the Middle Ages to this day it's never been touched by either world war cobblestone streets the old Rathaus the city hall the church in in Esslingen was originally Catholic and is now Protestant but it stands on the very place where the synagogue had stood that was burned to the
43:36 -  ground and in one of the episodes of the crusaders passing through where the Jews for safety locked themselves in their synagogue and seeing that the crusaders brought the whole community to its death in flames so the fires of the Holocaust had an earlier inception in the Middle Ages and Jews
43:58 -  remember that when you go to when you go to Esslingen now and there's the literature of the tourist agency of the bureaus there's not a word about the history of Jews that goes back into the 12th century I only found it by accident that as a student after coming out of the army
44:18 -  there's a reference to Esslingen and what had taken place during the time of the crusades and often the threat was convert or die what we're going to convert to this this mock thing this travesty this sacrilege this paganism
44:43 -  that celebrates a woman and her child which goes back to the pagan myths of earliest history never we prefer death how is that death affected by the husband and father killing his own children cutting the throat of his wife and then taking his own life that when the doors burst
45:09 -  open and the and the raging gentile court Christian community came in the whole Jewish community lay the whole Jewish community lay before them as dead this is the history you don't sweep that under the carpet it's alive in Jewish memory and so how is God going to bridge that in the last days
45:34 -  and bring some kind of communication between communities that have such a history of separation so you can understand the contempt for the goyim or they may be nice to me now but it's only when the going gets tougher for any reason we will again be their victim
46:01 -  you have to understand the way in which Jews will look upon quote Christians because the word gentile and Christian to them is synonymous and they can't distinguish between a nominal Christian because what shall a gentile be if
46:15 -  he's not a Muslim but a Christian and those that are born again I didn't see the distinction myself until my 34th and 35th years in that year's leave of absence from the teaching profession with a pack on my back outside of America and out into the nations being picked up by this strange
46:35 -  people almost daily who I could not stay with gentile neither could I say they were Jews they were another species of mankind that I could not identify then and realize now they were born again believers most Jews have not the privilege of contact or exposure to Christians of this kind
46:54 -  so that with one brush they tar everyone who is not Jewish and is gentile has been called Christian my mother could not understand why I could go to Germany and minister there she herself would not put a flick in that Volkswagen because what is German is Christian and what has come from
47:12 -  Germany has been our annihilation we need to be conscious of this lest we come in like bulls in the china shop are you say brother that's all I needed to hear at that time and I would be a dead man today if someone had come at me with any John 3 16 cliche even though the word of God is
47:34 -  true when you quote it as a convenience and it is not inspired by the spirit in a moment of confrontation with anyone Jew or gentle it becomes a cliche it's a dead word it antagonizes rather than quickens so you have to be eminently the man of the spirit or the woman of the spirit
47:53 -  to speak the right word and don't think that if you're quoting a scripture that that is necessarily the right word if the Lord himself in his wisdom is not calling for that particular word you may say something else of another kind that will surprise you and even offend you
48:10 -  as I have had occasion to speak to Jews like that man who wanted to have lunch with me who had the reputation of being a disputer and a debater and he was going to show that my whole faith was a fallacy a businessman and a big shot I forgot in what community in Tennessee who flew in
48:30 -  as the big executive and we had lunch together with a number of Christians and he was blabbing all the way blah blah blah blah and I didn't say a word finally said aren't you going to say anything I said well now that you ask I want you to know this is the most expensive lunch I have ever eaten
48:52 -  and I forgot what what followed it was an insult and I left him with that on another occasion with a Jewish lawyer that was had been brought by his Christian wife to hear me and listened with disgust and was standing in the hallway as I left the church with his face like a
49:13 -  mask of scorn he ended up in the same restaurant where I was taken and when I saw him at the table I took my plate knife and fork and I went over and I sat by him and then he went on to persuade me of what an exemplary man he is how he gives to charity and if God is God surely you'll have no
49:31 -  fault with him because he's full of good deeds and so on and I forgot how I said it I said dear brother so long as I have breath in my body I will persuade you that unless you forsake your self-righteousness and call upon the name of the Lord you shall surely perish what he said was
49:54 -  can't we take hands and shake hands and that you will maintain your conviction I'll keep mine I said never so long as you remain in your conviction you'll be you will eternally perish and I walked away I left that with that charge so these are just illustrations of how and what God will say
50:13 -  when God is saying and I praise God that the man whose word pierced my heart in German being picked up as a hitchhiker and taking me into a German inn for something to eat because he was remarkably touched that he picked up a Jew and I didn't even know why I divulged that when he picked me up
50:36 -  after I'd been standing for three hours in the rain and took my filthy wet book sack and threw it in the back seat of his car without any awareness that I was doing damage to his upholstery and we drove off and he looked at me and said why are you traveling like this I was not a kid
50:50 -  who's not the tour season oh I said I'm a modern man whose life has broken at its foundations I'm seeking for the deepest answers to life and I'm Jewish I don't know why I threw that in and I turned to look to see this guy turned off and that I had regrettably given him a piece of
51:10 -  information that was not necessary to excite his Gentile resistance and the guy was beaming the fact that I was Jewish was just for him something of enormous a moment it's like the shoemaker in that town in Transylvania Romania humble believer whose one prayer was Lord give
51:31 -  me one Jew before I die let me be your instrument in witnessing to one Jew who might be saved and in course of time came uh what's his name Richard Richard von Brand Jewish atheist marxist like me and this was this uh shoemaker in his simplicity talking to this erudite Jew
51:53 -  began to witness to him and gave him a new testament and and began to pierce him as a new testament came into my hand also a moment of time and Von Brand takes the new testament to a rabbi to get this the scoop on this and the rabbi himself reading it for the first time
52:11 -  and rubbing his beard says the shame Yiddish for how beautiful Sharon becomes in Yiddish same the shame the shame as he's reading for the first time these scriptures by which Von Brand ultimately was converted became the great Godly man that he was suffered for such a faith
52:34 -  being a missionary to the Jews in Romania and then having to face 13 years in solitary confinement and much torture and then blessing the church after his release about what it means to follow Christ began with a shoemaker began with a man who picked me up off the side of road and said
52:53 -  hey let's stop and have a bite who's not offended by the fact that I'm a Jew and over there over this table I'm pouring out to this man my deepest soul things that I've not shared with closest friends my mother then wife or anyone I'm sharing with a Gentile stranger of all of the vexation of
53:13 -  my heart of the of a world that is teeter tottering into atomic and moral holocaust and there's no answer no I've been a Marxist I've been this that it's not going to save us I'm wondering why I'm pouring out these things of despair and hopelessness and the man is not just hearing me
53:29 -  waiting to jump on me with John 3 16 his hearing of me as I've often said was an act of love I had never been so heard that's what was drawing my heart out was the way in which I was being heard not a man waiting his moment of opportunity to put a match in his belt his hearing was an act of love
53:49 -  and finally when it drew out my fullest heart there was nothing more to say I'd come to the end I looked at this guy nothing at all conspicuous to look at like the church itself thinking to myself what is he going to say to me Berkeley grad a graduate of Marxist institutes
54:07 -  a traveler reader nothing new under the sun and he looked up and he said to me in a quiet voice are you safe brother if he had said that I would have died he said what the world needs because I was speaking to him my anxiety for the world and its collapse and hopelessness already said
54:28 -  what the world needs is for men to wash one another's feet when I heard that I went down to encourage your hearts I sat there with my arms folded over my chest my face still showed cynical resistance but my inner man the human spirit was so pierced through by that one
54:55 -  statement it went on the floor and was whimpering I had never heard wash one another's feet but in the hearing of it because it was the word of the Lord that was sent there was not a cliche there was not a cliche something broke in me and I pictured the arrogant hot shots of the world
55:12 -  like art cats who are going to save the world with rivers of blood like Karl Marx and all of the things that I've issued out of our Jewish determination to bring causes that the world would be saved not by causes but by humility by men bowing to wash the feet of another and the
55:30 -  first thing I thought was teachers washing the feet of their administrators because my last statement at the faculty meeting at the high school in California was we need a revolution against the system the enemy the the administrators versus the teachers the children versus their
55:50 -  parents the white versus the black the the Palestinian versus the Israel the Israeli so everywhere you look there's division strife enmity and death when you said wash one another's feet never having read that I broke and thought Eureka
56:11 -  it's a spirit of humility that will save the world and from that point on the man began to speak to me the gospel in German and I wanted to resist and say hey that's not for me I'm Jewish that's your book we have ours not that I knew what ours was but the word of truth was coming forth
56:30 -  in to my inner man and I could not turn from it I left that building that day like a drunken sailor I was staggered I was overwhelmed by that confrontation that came by the spirit through a scent word or else I would be dead today that set in motion my salvation because a man stopped
56:51 -  who was Godly and not ruled by cliches or the necessity to put a match in his belt who could both hear if the hearing of God in love and speak the truth of love and I've tried to find that man I had his name and address I knew something about him he was a bookkeeper he was in the church choir
57:13 -  he knew about architecture he knew about art he knew about intellectual things he was impressive and my first day in Egypt I was picked up and had lost my wallet with his name and address lost it and every time I've been back to that area in Switzerland many times I keep asking the
57:31 -  believers I've now ceased from asking do you know a man by the name of Richard he works in the car agency he's the bookkeeper he sings in a choir he's this he's that no one has ever heard of a Richard maybe I've not found anybody who in fact knows him or there is no Richard per se as a man
57:49 -  and that I was picked up by an angel and we ought to at least be alive to that possibility that unless we are angels and that Jews cannot distinguish whether it's a man who has encountered us or an angel we have come to the place of God's intention and we're not speaking as men out of
58:09 -  conventional wisdom or out of a cliched collection of appropriate verses but the word of the Lord as it is mediated from heaven because only God knows the heart of that one to whom we have been brought so our task is to move from them to angels to become angelic
58:31 -  how many Christians are willing to be inconvenienced to suffer the process by which we are brought from one to the other we are only too content with our present condition and if we were not for those Jews we might well be satisfied with it but they make a
58:48 -  requirement of a kind that shapes us and why should we be that for them what did they ever do for us but threaten the world by their intransigence and their stubbornness unwilling to negotiate and give up a little land it's a rare Christian who can rise above that
59:06 -  not echo that and be willing for whatever the cost would be so another factor is the miracle of the state of Israel itself and that has been sustained for half a century giving every reason to expect it will yet remain
59:29 -  though I don't expect that myself raises questions that is God with them in their present condition maybe they don't need to be saved if God is favoring that nation and has caused it to be and yet maintains it
59:46 -  in the interfaith dialogue between Jews and Christians the condition that Jews require in order to participate is that the Christians recognize the validity of Judaism that they're not coming to use the occasion of interfaith dialogue to convert that Judaism is as valid as
01:00:06 -  Christianity and the Christian theologians that participate have accepted those terms as a remarkable concession in my opinion why have they moved from evangelism to the Jew to dialogue around the table because the holocaust raises the question of the issue of the church
01:00:28 -  and its audacity now to call Jews to conversion after it has been the principal architect of the holocaust it's a guilt out of the holocaust as somehow being a statement of Christian bankruptcy that has moved the church the main line church from being an instrument of evangelism to
01:00:50 -  moving to a idea of dialogue around the table on the grounds that Judaism is valid it's something that that Paul would never have conceded but the church has and it's a remarkable weakening not only its relationship with the Jew but its presence in the world
01:01:09 -  it has weakened its own knowledge of the gospel and the boldness with which it needs to be promulgated because it makes this concession you might think i'm talking out of two sides of my mouth that i'm talking on one hand i'm appealing
01:01:26 -  for an empathy and a pathos and identification with the Jews and at the other hand i'm saying no compromise on the issue of the gospel but the gospel remains a non-issue until it can be presented in a way that is bears the sense of christ to those who have been historically
01:01:46 -  turned off against it that's our that's our tension that's our staggering predicament and it will require us to become saints to pass through it we cannot in our present condition break through in this historical obstruction except that we come to a condition of an ultimate kind
01:02:06 -  to which we would not have come if they were not present to us as the issue of God's requirement if only they would disappear then we would be freed from the the issue of the cross and our suffering to become angelic i'm going to be reading tonight or tomorrow
01:02:24 -  something from basileia schlink on the bride of christ and she makes the whole issue of the identity of the bride of christ the issue of the cross the issue of suffering nothing else will shape the character of the church to be adorned for the bridegroom and that's something might
01:02:40 -  welcome to us most profoundly in our identification with this jewish people not only a suffering with them and from by them because of their defensive resistance but also the world's enmity against us if we side with the people whom the world despises
01:02:58 -  just but just like those who went to the concentration camps like korytan boom where their identity with jews we too will face that persecution so if their state has survived 50 years without christ maybe we need to think twice
01:03:19 -  do they have a place of validity that does not require our gospel and is our gospel really a the absolute requirement that we think it to be if they seem to exist and prosper so without it other factors like the moral and ethical superiority of family and community life appears
01:03:48 -  to exceed our own they seem to be prospering without christ more than we who have christ and the answer to that question is this the devil is not in any way troubling them about their sanctity he wants to allow them to presume that they are in a place of superiority and moral
01:04:09 -  acceptability even to God by virtue of their works and their own composure and ethical and moral behavior once they become believers then they'll have they'll enter the conflict between flesh and spirit that only a born-again believer knows but while you're outside that faith the
01:04:28 -  enemy will allow you to think yourself not only acceptable but exemplary and so they they exhibit like the moments a moral quality of life that moves us to envy and even raises the question are we so right in our presumption when their moral conduct and ethical concern exceeds our own
01:04:53 -  so all of these are factors that would affect gentile christians in their attitude and relationship toward jews unless we understand these things and can rise above them and that we with that we are not chafed by their air of superiority but rather have a sense of anguish and pathos because we know
01:05:18 -  it's an illusion and that in the day of the lord when they pass from this life there'll be a shock of horror that what they lived in and congratulated themselves by was a deception and it's too late now to remedy or to correct we know that for all lost persons and it ought to be an anguish that
01:05:40 -  underlies our relationship with them and enables us to bear their hostility and their superiority without ourselves being adversely affected is am i coming through does that make sense if we don't have that that sense of eternal loss as Paul had it in the cry that he sounds
01:05:59 -  at the commencement of the three great chapters of romans 9 through 11 that he would wish himself a curse for his brethren's sake how could the rest of romans 9 through 11 have been expressed it had to begin first by a note of the deepest anguish of soul for the lostness of his own
01:06:15 -  kinsmen according to the flesh mirroring and echoing the cry of Jesus himself on his way to the cross looking over druslim and weeping over the city how often would i have taken you under my wings as a hen her chicks but you would not and now you have missed the day of your visitation
01:06:32 -  and the day of your peace the question is have we come to that weeping have we come to that anguish do we have an empathetic heart for the sorrow and the tragedy of jewish history and jewish present condition even when it's untroubled let alone that which they will soon face
01:06:51 -  if we come to them clinically and correctly without a pathos of identification like unto Paul's they'll not heal us and even our best intentions will fail and our words will be brittle
01:07:07 -  and mechanical something more will be required and it's in that requirement that we are fitted to be brides for the brides for the bridegroom because the bridegroom himself is full of pathos full of empathy full of sympathy full of compassion full of mercy to those who are undeserving
01:07:26 -  mercy has nothing to do with the with the those for whom the mercy is given it's not a response to their virtue it's solely the expression of the one who extends it it's all the more mercy because it's undeserving easy for us to extend sympathy and mercy to those who have some quality
01:07:48 -  that endears itself to us but to those that are abrasive hostile offensive unpleasant that that would be the mercy of God and the how does roman's love and end that by your mercy they may obtain mercy if we have not a mercy to extend and it's only doctrinal and correct
01:08:10 -  as a category of our faith and is not an experiential and existential reality in us formed by God in the school of the cross what shall we have to extend the jew raises the issue of the truth of our life in christ the truth of our sanctity and that is
01:08:30 -  the mystery and the wisdom of God we can go on the fear of zionist conspiracy to take over the world what is that publication of the protocols of zion have you ever heard of it that i think was published first in russia in mid-1800s that jews have correctly identified as a fraud a thing to
01:08:57 -  further anti-jewish persecutions that describes a conspiracy of jews worldwide to take over that comes out of a warped thing of God's own intention that Israel and redeemed jury will be central to all nations that when God established the number of nations he did so
01:09:20 -  in accordance with the number of the sons of Israel there is an instinctive fear and suspicion on gentiles that jews will take over the world hey look how prominent they are they're bankers they're in media they're in communication they make the movies they write
01:09:34 -  the books they shape our mind and thought and they they have something together that's unspoken that we are of which we need to be suspicious a rumor was circulated that rabbis were telling the jewish community of new york do not be present in the trade towers on september 11th
01:09:54 -  for it's a conspiracy that of which we are engaged to bring those towers down to set in motion certain anti-islamic elements that will serve our purpose so be absent that day from work you know that there are hundreds upon hundreds of thousands who believe that
01:10:13 -  it raises the question of why is it that gentiles are so quick and so susceptible to believe a rumor of that kind because they want to because they have already been prepared for because they already have an instinct of suspicion because there's something about jews and their clannishness
01:10:30 -  and their identity together that that would make such a suspicion viable you you think that that's a fit message to begin a conference and that i would be taken aside in a room on the next day and be interrogated by the leaders and
01:10:49 -  be accused of lacking anointing and meeting a deeper circumcision of the heart because i spoke in this way they didn't like the subject and i went down to the same subject for three messages so that when it ended and on my way out of the building and into the parking lot
01:11:10 -  i was accosted by the worship leader with whom i was in a continual tension over those days he said if anyone came speaking like you about indians or mexicans or black people i would be completely turned off against any of them and now because you have made that your sole subject
01:11:28 -  i'm completely turned off against jews i'm a liberal man and i'm tolerant with everyone and i don't need to have any particular special empathy and what are jews are they something special in themselves brother if you are a brother his exact words
01:11:46 -  what antagonized that man so because of the repetition of the subject beginning in this way but before my next message after having been critiqued by these men as needing a deeper circumcision of heart and wanting an anointing a brother came up and said i want you to not knowing
01:12:03 -  what had taken place privately i want you to know that your first message pierced me through altogether and at the end of that message the woman cried out i have been ripped off she cried i have been ripped off where has this been all my life i had no consciousness of these things at all
01:12:23 -  is what she was saying and her husband across the room pointing me you can't leave us like this you can't raise a subject like this and leave us suspended that came out of this statement accused by those who were in leadership that somehow it was wanting anointing well i wish you
01:12:41 -  could have seen me sitting there i looked like a smug cheshire cat having just lapped up a plate of cream i'm listening to these men i'm not at all convicted of course i have a naive belief that what i spoke was given up God right that he himself is the the author of my visiting to that spokane
01:13:01 -  synagogue and tempering and setting something in my spirit to make this a first statement not knowing what the second statement would be or the end but to begin with this and so i'm listening to these men i i'm polite respectful i'm willing to acknowledge that yes who doesn't need a deeper
01:13:21 -  circumcision of the heart and breaking but at the same time naively confident that i have been obedient to speak what the lord has wanted and that these men somehow were not able to hear it why why why is that that one man came and said i was pierced through and hearing the same word
01:13:41 -  i said strange that you should say that how could you have been pierced through if the word was not anointed so it's a good question because it gives us a clarity on what this prophetic call is in your moments of greatest obedience you're going to be misunderstood
01:13:58 -  misconstrued and accused not by the world but by the church and not by the church at large but the finest and best expression of it and in the last analysis even those from within your own fellowship are you willing to bear that there's a prophetic tension and a prophetic suffering
01:14:21 -  and a prophetic anguish and even though you have prayed and the lord has given you this so rarely do i write anything like that that i would speak from notes like this this is a remarkably unusual maybe because it was so perilous maybe because it's so new striking a
01:14:40 -  note like that these men didn't invite me to canada to speak on this they thought they were going to hear the old art messages of a kind that they could say yay and amen that's in keeping with the church as the central purpose of God and the restoration etc etc they got something else from
01:14:56 -  the tally of the kind but it was not for them alone the lord was using that conference as a platform to bring to the church at large a statement and a theme and a note that was being struck for a first time and they didn't want to be the auspices they wanted what was
01:15:13 -  accessible and convenient and appropriate to what they wanted to enjoy one man was one of the leaders said to me we had prayed before you came out that the lord would stretch us unbearably and break new categories of understanding that would even seem to
01:15:30 -  threaten what we have already understood i said your dear man the lord has heard your prayer and answered it far more than you know so i end asking the question who then being gentile is not susceptible to an inevitable
01:15:54 -  antagonism or a secret envy toward this jewish people who is not susceptible who does not have an underlying suspicion or antagonism and maybe the first order of business is the acknowledgement of that possibility
01:16:15 -  we may never have had an occasion to express it but that doesn't take away from its presence it's latent until it's recognized and confessed and given up and broken and given up and broken
01:16:31 -  so let's have a little prayer at this point and see how the lord will will follow from this gracious God remember how we spoke at the first that he will give us opportunity to critique the recent experience in canada not to exalt ourselves
01:16:52 -  or to see good guys and bad guys but to understand of a prophetic event in its constituent elements they were classic and will always accompany any obedience to which a prophetic person or church is called and we have got to know it my God and to be fit and to prepare for it
01:17:13 -  and also to sense what you're saying what you're wanting the church to recognize what depth must of real breaking must come in the heart what ironic circumcision must come in the heart of the man who who said to me you need this when what he's saying not realizing it is prophetic
01:17:30 -  it's the church that needs a deeper circumcision of heart it's the church that needs a deeper breaking and what will be the more likely provision to provoke that breaking than the deep awareness that however our life has been used of the lord and is for the lord there is still the prospect
01:17:52 -  of something in our deeps that we had never been called to consider that needs to be recognized as a final obstruction to the full possession of the lord and the expression of his son of david character to a people who have never seen him so expressed and although we would say
01:18:12 -  me anti-semitic no way i've never would ever hurt or physical abuse but this is so deep it does not need that expression even the resistance to the message can itself be that expression the lord teach us instruct us deal with us you're wanting something new there's a new wine reserved for the
01:18:36 -  last days that is the best of all but it must have a container supple and yielded to receive it and so we asked that even as i'm speaking like a fool not even knowing how to proceed further that somehow you're not only speaking but dealing come precious God give us a heart like unto your
01:18:57 -  own as Paul the apostle had that distinguishes him as an apostle and might well be the very critical feature that makes an apostle an apostle is the heart to this people not because they are flesh and blood kingsman but because they are the brethren of the lord
01:19:17 -  so my God work in our deeps we pray we thank you give you praise for these privileged days in yeshua's holy name amen
