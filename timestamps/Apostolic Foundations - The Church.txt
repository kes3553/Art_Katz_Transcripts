Apostolic Foundations - The Church

00:00 -  I'm experiencing a remarkable sense of liberty this morning, all the more remarkable in that I don't really know where I'm going. No message as such, just a radical leaping in.
00:25 -  An abandonment to the book of Ephesians, and there's a reason why it must be this way. The Lord has an intention with us beyond instruction, and something must come to us by the Spirit as revelation, given on the spot by the Lord himself.
01:10 -  That's the way Paul speaks even of himself in his own ministry in the third chapter of Ephesians. He talks about the stewardship of God's grace in verse 2, which was given to me for you. That by revelation there was made known to me the mystery.
01:42 -  And then he speaks in the fourth verse about his insight, which he received into the mystery of Christ. And then in verse 4, he talks about the intelligence that he had of the mystery of Christ. All this is immersed in the mystery.
02:01 -  And in verse 9, he speaks again of this mystery, which for ages has been hidden in God. And which must now be revealed to us by revelation through the Spirit, by the grace of God. And we need something of that operation today.
02:34 -  There's something so holy and so sacred about these mysteries, that man is not allowed to pry into them. They will not submit themselves to an intellectual examination.
03:01 -  It is something which is hidden in God until the hour that he is prepared to reveal it. And it is revealed to a certain class of men only, holy apostles and prophets, that they, by the grace which is given,
03:28 -  might bring to light the unfathomable riches of Christ. Paul speaks about the grace that was given to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ. We've already repeated the word given several times.
04:00 -  The grace that is given, the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you. Everything here is opposed to human pride and arrogance. Everything is totally subject to that which is given.
04:27 -  And that is exactly my condition this morning. I can plead with God. I can stamp my feet petulantly.
04:40 -  Lord, don't you know that I have responsibility? I'm going to be standing before an audience of your people. Some have come from quite a distance to attend these sessions.
04:53 -  And our own people whom we've brought. Don't you realize I can be embarrassed if I have nothing clear to say? You must give me this in advance.
05:06 -  I must know what I'm to speak. Silence. We have come full circle after 2,000 years.
05:22 -  And if we're going to understand the mysteries of Christ, the mystery of the church, that is the apostolic glory,
05:34 -  it's going to be by the grace which is given, even now, that I might preach to you
05:42 -  by the grace which is given to me who is a steward of these mysteries, the unfathomable riches of Christ.
05:54 -  This is an historical moment in this room this morning. It has waited on this hour for the coming forth of men like myself
06:10 -  and the coming forth of the maturity of the body, for the conditions again to meet by which the mystery can be revealed,
06:27 -  which until now has been hidden in God. So I'm going to pray for a grace to be given.
06:41 -  I'd rather choke and splutter and go silent for the rest of our time than I should seek by some kind of operation of mind or Jewish intelligence to present something credible.
07:07 -  God is after something more than information or instruction, the revealing of a mystery. And I pray that you have an appropriate spirit and disposition of heart
07:28 -  for the unfolding of such things. If God will give us the grace, we will be most privileged
07:41 -  and most responsible to whom much is given, much shall be required.
07:51 -  Let's pray for this. Great grace we pray, Lord, upon us all.
08:03 -  Close us in with yourself and establish even the atmosphere of this hour, give us a true expectancy of faith.
08:21 -  May our eyes be turned upward. May we see the things that are invisible and eternal. May you be pleased to reveal this morning
08:37 -  in the measure that it shall please you, that which till now has been hidden, that we might see
08:47 -  and fulfill the purposes in our seeing, to the glory of your name. In Jesus' name we pray.
09:00 -  Amen. This grace is given to His holy prophets and apostles. We have not even been fitted by our religious experience to expect them.
09:20 -  We think of them only as something passed in the historic church. That has been our conventional evangelical teaching. The apostles and the prophets are a past phenomenon.
09:55 -  They have laid their foundations and now we can go on independent of them. But I don't believe that. The scripture says, till we all come to the unity of the faith and the fullness
10:13 -  and the stature of Jesus Christ unto a perfect man. And He gave for that coming apostles and prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
10:38 -  for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come. Until we have all come, we shall always then be in need of apostles and prophets. For the perfecting of the saints even comes before the work of the ministry.
11:00 -  Here is already something that needs to be restored in the divine order in which it is given. For the want of apostolic insistence by men of that authority, for the desire of the Holy Spirit to be restored in the divine order in which it is given.
11:21 -  For the want of apostolic insistence by men of that authority, we have already erred against God by elevating the work of the ministry above the perfecting of the saints. Jesus said, you shall be witnesses unto me.
11:51 -  Not do witnessing for me. The being precedes the doing. But as those of us who have sought to walk in the snow,
12:12 -  to be is infinitely more difficult than to do. And so this is an hour of restoration. God is bringing us back to his original vision and purpose,
12:34 -  that which was given at the first. And it is a difficult time of adjustment from things conventional and institutional to things apostolic.
12:53 -  We know how powerful things become by virtue of time and tradition. We need again to see the restoration of apostolic and prophetic men. Who come to us in the authority of God,
13:18 -  to restore the vision which has been lost, and to build according to the pattern that is given on the mount. For the tabernacle of God, the house of God,
13:34 -  for Paul concludes this third chapter with this very pungent scripture. To him be glory in the church, by Christ Jesus,
13:53 -  throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
14:01 -  We need to apologize before God, that we have dismissed such words as a kind of biblical poetry. So therefore the first thing that needs to be restored,
14:30 -  is a profound appreciation for the glory of God. This is altogether contrary to the utilitarian spirit of our age. What is the criteria by which we have measured successful church in our own generation?
14:59 -  Were the meetings good? Did you like it? How did you like the preacher?
15:10 -  Are you being fed? How was the worship? The attendance?
15:18 -  The budget? These are all pitiful and earthly criteria. There is only one apostolic criterion,
15:35 -  and it needs to be jealously and burningly held. And to him be glory in the church. Not just in our own generation,
15:55 -  but world without end, throughout all ages. We need to lift our scene,
16:09 -  and see the church as something more than an agency for our purposes. It's true that we receive benefit by our participation, but that is not its first purpose.
16:34 -  And until we see the first purpose, and give ourselves to that purpose, we ourselves will lose the benefit.
16:45 -  What is the first purpose? For which he gave himself for the church, and washes it with the water of the word,
16:59 -  that it might be a beautiful bride, a dawn for the bridegroom, unto him.
17:15 -  I'll keep repeating that until the wall falls down. Because everything that is in the spirit of this world is unto us. Unto us.
17:32 -  Remember what Peter said on the Mount of Transfiguration? Beholding Jesus in his glory, in his transcendent glory with Moses and Elijah, the law and the prophets,
17:50 -  it slipped out of his mouth without even thinking, an involuntary reflex action, a universal statement of the church in its carnality.
18:07 -  It is good for us to be here. He has at the center of all of his consideration, it is good for us unto him.
18:21 -  A lui, us, him, nous, lui, something needs to be turned. There needs to be a massive wrenching and turning on an apostolic pivot. It is our foremost task in this generation
18:46 -  to move the church from its deep-seated egocentrism. Our programs, our purposes, our benefits, it's good for us
19:03 -  to one single maniacal thing, in single-eyed absoluteness, whatever the sacrifice or the cost,
19:20 -  to our traditions, to our practices, unto him, be glory in the church,
19:35 -  not just in our generation, but world without end, throughout all ages.
19:44 -  I just want very simply to announce that we are called to be part of an eternal masterpiece in God. Do you understand how jealous God is over this?
20:05 -  Why it is he would not allow us to come with our briefcase full of messages? Why it requires an unfolding by the spirit of grace and of revelation? Because if it's to be a glory unto him,
20:23 -  it must be a glory by him. And through him, if it is to be unto him, it's the grace which it is given.
20:38 -  It's the grace which it is given. This is not good news for our French, Swiss, and Jewish pride. Paul says in the eighth verse,
21:02 -  to me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given. To preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
21:16 -  and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God. We need to raise the question.
21:31 -  If this great apostle was totally dependent on the grace that was given, to preach the unfathomable riches of Christ, by what means shall we fulfill them?
21:58 -  Grace. Therefore, I love the apostolic scriptures. Those that believed were together.
22:13 -  And great grace was upon them all. Task number one is to break the power of the deep egocentrism of the Church. Task number two, to break the more powerful deep-seated individualism of the saints.
22:52 -  Those that believed were together is more than a statement of sitting alongside each other in pews. As God looks upon the modern Church today, with all of its charismatic, hale fellow, well-met, back-slapping and beer-hugs,
23:26 -  brother, brother, do you know what he sees? A conglomerate of individuals. Not an organic, tempered body together.
23:49 -  Paul was dependent upon a grace to preach the riches. And we are equally dependent on a grace to fulfill it. But it's a grace which is given to us all.
24:10 -  And not individually. I know that we prefer to be in our own garret or attic with our concordance, searching out the riches of Christ.
24:22 -  I know that we prefer to be in our little studio, in our little house, where we would like to be with just the Bible and concordance. We are in the Scriptures.
24:37 -  But a great grace rests upon them all. It is through the Church that God now wants to manifest His great wisdom to the principalities and powers. It is not some kind of institutional, institutional organization in a religious conglomerate,
25:10 -  but a Church which is an apostolic organization, founded, established by God, by His Spirit. Men who are in authentic relationship with each other.
25:28 -  Another quality of life and attitude and perspective. Whose very presence is a statement against the principalities and the powers. How interesting that Paul should begin this chapter by introducing himself as the prisoner of Christ.
25:57 -  For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, the very least of all saints. Oh, you said, come on, Paul, don't kid us.
26:15 -  You're the formidable, you're the apostle. Forget this false modesty. It's not false people.
26:27 -  He saw himself and deeply believed himself to be the least of all saints. This is a remarkable phenomenon of which the world knows nothing. That as you are granted the stewardship of the mysteries,
26:50 -  and to you much grace is given that you might see, you see not only the unspeakable riches of Christ, you see also by that same light your own terrible inadequacy.
27:15 -  God is waiting for prisoners in this generation. Bon slaves of the Lord Jesus Christ. How interesting that Paul always puts this credential before the fact that he's an apostle.
27:35 -  And how interesting it is to notice that Paul always places this title before the title of apostle. This is an apostolic requirement. This is not for amateurs, dilettants,
27:52 -  but it's for servants, not just servants as we understand the word modernly speaking, who work for some rich employer from nine to five and then borrow his car and go out for a smoke behind the building. We need to come more deeply into a biblical and apostolic seeing.
28:27 -  Paul was a slave. He had no rights of his own. He had no life of his own.
28:38 -  He could not in himself determine his coming in or his going out. He could do nothing and speak nothing other than that which was given him. All of his attainment,
28:57 -  his brilliant Jewish theological background, his brilliant Jewish theological background, raised by the Gamalian rabbi,
29:05 -  all of that was to be counted as dung. All of that was to be counted as dung. He had no certain dwelling place.
29:12 -  He had no certain dwelling place. He says we apostles are counted as last. He says we apostles are counted as last.
29:21 -  We are the off scouring of the earth. We are the off scouring of the earth. Poor but making many rich.
29:27 -  Poor but making many rich. Unknown yet known. Unknown yet known.
29:33 -  How many of us have a taste for this kind of identification? How many of us have a taste for this kind of identification? We itch to be known.
29:43 -  We itch to be known. Our religious reputation. Our religious reputation.
29:50 -  Our distinctive scholarship. Our distinctive scholarship. What we have published, what we have spoken.
29:57 -  What we have published, what we have spoken. This church is waiting for a certain kind of man This church is waiting for a certain kind of man
30:09 -  whose life is not his own. whose life is not his own. Who lives only for one purpose.
30:15 -  Who lives only for one purpose. The glory of God. The glory of God.
30:20 -  You say brother why is that so important? You say brother why is that so important? Because the true church is built on that foundation.
30:28 -  Because the true church is built on that foundation The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets
30:38 -  Never and always. Forever and always. Not just what they preach, what they teach, what they reveal
30:45 -  Not just what they preach, what they teach, what they reveal but what they are in themselves as men. but what they are in themselves as men.
30:54 -  What is an apostolic church? It is exactly what Paul is in himself. Ritlaj
31:06 -  Ritlaj Made manifest corporately in a total body. Manifesté corporellement, collectivement, dans un corps.
31:15 -  The same passion, The same boldness, The same authority,
31:21 -  La même autorité. The same relevance with Jews and synagogues or Greeks on Mars Hill. The same appropriation of the things that are invisible and eternal.
31:41 -  The same indifference to the world and to its rewards. The willingness to suffer for Christ's sake. And the recognition that there is a suffering that precedes the glory.
32:05 -  That's why Paul could say, imitate me. I'm the model. Follow me as I follow Christ.
32:17 -  You want to know what God wants in his true church? If it is to be his presence in the earth. Look at me.
32:30 -  Many times he speaks of himself as blameless. And he exhorts the new believers in Thessalonica. To walk worthy of the manner to which they were called.
32:49 -  To the glory and the kingdom. That's why our walk has been so defective. We grimly seek to resist sin and temptation.
33:07 -  If we do, it's more because of the fear of being found out before men than being offending God. What a pitiful and wretched way to live. No wonder so many of our people are unhappy.
33:27 -  Just wanting to make it get by. They have not understood the standard. To walk worthy of the manner to which they were called.
33:55 -  To the glory and the kingdom. Oh, I know that you're waiting when this session is finished to get to a dictionary. And you'll seek there to find a definition for the word glory.
34:10 -  Let me save you the effort. You'll not find it. And yet, it's imperative that we do.
34:21 -  Not by referring to the world's definitions. But by seeking that revelation that must come from God. It's a grace which is given.
34:39 -  It lies beyond words. But when it comes into your soul, you're made a fool for Christ's sake.
34:49 -  You love the church. You'll suffer for the church. You'll be patient with the church.
34:55 -  You'll come again and again and again. You'll suffer its carnality and its immaturities. Because you know that it must be a glory unto him.
35:15 -  We need to pray for the restoration of these words. Or we have nothing. We have technique, we have methodology, we have nomenclature, forms.
35:26 -  The glory of God is all. And if we have not a sense of it, we have nothing.
35:56 -  What is this principle mystery that God is now wanting revealed? To bring to light, it says in the Ninth Verse, the administration of the mystery.
36:20 -  It says in the Ninth Verse, Chapter 3, to bring to light the administration of the mystery. I don't know what word is used here in French for administration.
36:32 -  Dispensation is not good. More like the application or the fulfillment of.
36:44 -  You see, a mystery is not just something that we spiritually enjoy. It is given to us now to be fulfilled. Which for ages has been hidden in God.
37:02 -  Who created all things in order that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the Church to the rulers and the authorities in heavenly places.
37:20 -  Now this is truly a mystery. Now this is too much to hear in a single statement. This has been our mistake
37:39 -  and the large reason for our missing the glory of what is spoken here. We are not just reading an ordinary literature
37:53 -  It is even distinguished from other epistles in the Holy Scripture. This is something that lies too deep for words.
38:09 -  Human vocabulary cannot contain it. There's something here that is burgeoning and palpitating, waiting to break out
38:19 -  of the confinement of language. This is beyond mind. Beyond intelligence.
38:31 -  It's something which needs to be intuitive apprehended or yet better
38:43 -  we need to be apprehended by it. It needs to capture us and take hold of us in such a way
38:56 -  that we are ruined for anything less. We can never again go back to programs
39:12 -  to institutional religious requirements to meeting the needs of the people forever our taste for these things will be ruined
39:26 -  because something is being brought to light that God has created all things and that it can really penetrate you.
39:42 -  It's something that will make your mind explode it will shatter your every category you'll dismiss this
39:54 -  you'll accuse Paul of exaggeration you'll say no it cannot be it is among the purposes
40:06 -  but it's not the single purpose for which God has created all things Is it?
40:16 -  Do we dare believe this? This is what God's word says through this holy apostle
40:28 -  that God has created all things the whole of this planet earth the nations and their boundaries
40:44 -  the resources of this earth the atmosphere that makes human life possible the whole interplanetary galactic structure of the universe
40:56 -  he has created all these things in order that through the church
41:10 -  we don't have to hear anything more it's enough reason right there to fall out of our seats to prostrate ourselves as dead before God
41:24 -  this is too staggering Does he behold the church in that kind of importance? Is it that exquisite to him
41:40 -  to the exclusion of all other things that are only supportive and secondary which the church has disdained
41:52 -  the world has disdained and ignored and shuttled off into the corner as some kind of harmless Sunday phenomenon
42:08 -  Can he mean that? All of this for the church? Yes
42:21 -  and we are the last to see it we have been so quick to accept the world's definition of our church
42:33 -  a pleasant little religious and cultural entity that exists as a supplement and support to our church
42:39 -  a pleasant and cultural entity that exists as a supplement and support to the important purposes of the world
42:49 -  a pleasant and interesting entity that exists simply as a supplement
42:55 -  and to support the much more important goals of life in the world something that provides pleasant and complimentary services
43:05 -  some religious instruction some moral value and produces a more responsible people
43:14 -  that will make more adequate employees and so long as you accept that definition and timidly confine yourself to it
43:30 -  in the limitations that the world has established as a Sunday phenomenon and that same false lying spirit
43:40 -  that was expressed by the Greek philosophers in their tribute to the unknown God that pseudo spirituality
43:56 -  that throws God a bone that needs to be repudiated and repented of
44:09 -  and we need to see the church as God himself sees all of our seeing needs to be brought into conjunction with his
44:21 -  for this is in a word it is to see exactly as God sees
44:30 -  it is to accept God's statement as being true however much it boggles our minds
44:46 -  and disturbs our categories it was said of Israel of old that the prophets prophesied falsely
45:01 -  and the priests bore rule through them a whole religious system predicated upon a lie
45:19 -  and the people of Israel and the people loved to have it so do you know what we need to acknowledge
45:33 -  that deep in our cowardly hearts we prefer Sunday Christianity and harmless midweek Bible studies
45:51 -  to apostolic involvement and commitment which will assuredly bring upon our heads apostolic persecution
46:07 -  there's much to be repented for for we have all sinned and fallen short
46:18 -  of the glory of God you know what Paul says in the 11th verse this was in accordance with the eternal
46:36 -  purpose which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord oh hallelujah for apostles
46:47 -  hallelujah for their seeing for the grace of the revelation which is given them to preach this and to bring this to life
47:01 -  and to let us know that we are called to the Lord that we are called to the eternal
47:10 -  purpose of God not to be deferred for the time of eternity
47:24 -  but to be brought now into our present consideration eternity must be brought into time
47:34 -  it's not just the luxury of an intellectual contemplation of the future but if our present life is
47:45 -  to mean something in this age we must deeply embrace and take into ourselves
47:59 -  what is the eternal purpose of God for the church I'm not satisfied that we have even yet begun to scratch this and to communicate it
48:31 -  and yet I'm completely conscious that you are an appreciative and sensitive Christian audience in your theory
48:45 -  but I'll tell you how insanely jealous I am about this that I will not be persuaded that you have really understood that this mystery has been brought to life
48:59 -  in your deepest consciousness until I see you prostrate on your face before God to recognize that this is the purpose for your salvation
49:19 -  it was not to save you from your sins and to make you a nicer person and to improve your marriage
49:31 -  these things are true but they are not the first things we need to reverse our priorities
49:45 -  we need to be saved from ourselves our fears, our timidities, our apprehensions the low level of our Christian living and perception
50:01 -  the struggle against sin trying not to fall and God has given us the very means that we might see
50:15 -  that the eyes of our understanding might be open that we might know what is the hope of His calling the riches of His glory
50:27 -  of His inheritance in the saints to grasp the eternal purpose and to recognize that we are called
50:39 -  for it changes everything this will be the end of all foolish and silly controversy
51:19 -  do I need to speak with tongues? or I have other gifts? this whole little silly controversy
51:29 -  about the charismatic gifts, the spirit which we could think important or not maybe they need it but I don't need it
51:45 -  yes that's true so long as your life is set into another context it's the mere issue of attending services
51:59 -  or other religious requirements which is easy for you to perform out of your own natural abilities
52:12 -  the issue of the Spirit of God is an idle discussion but once you glimpse and grasp the eternal purposes
52:30 -  there's a deep cry that comes out of your bowels it's the apostolic cry was ever upon the lips of Paul
52:42 -  who is sufficient for these things if you are living in a Christianity for which you are sufficient
52:56 -  I want to tell you this morning you are outside the faith the apostolic faith
53:08 -  that needs to be contended for once given to the saints God has called us to the impossible
53:20 -  to that which is beyond us that through him and to him
53:30 -  unto him to whom be glory forever we are so fixed in time
53:57 -  we are so narrow in our considerations that a career in religion is almost a corollary of a secular career
54:13 -  we have lost the whole apostolic sense of things of a church world without end throughout all ages
54:27 -  that has called us to be seated with him in heavenly places far above all rule and authority
54:39 -  power and dominion every name that is named not only in this age
54:49 -  but also in the ages to come the second chapter he repeats it again he made us alive together with Christ
55:03 -  and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in order that
55:13 -  whenever you see those words in order that take a deep breath
55:21 -  stand up on your tiptoes to hear what follows for this is the purpose of it all
55:33 -  for which reason he has seated us with him in heavenly places above all rule and authority and power
55:41 -  in order that in the ages to come he might show the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness
55:55 -  toward us in Christ Jesus now listen children it has nothing at all to do
56:04 -  with any benefit that comes to us it has not even to do with any purpose of God in the earth
56:20 -  it has not even to do with his rule and authority in this kingdom in the earth all of which is sublimely important
56:32 -  but now listen deeply this goes beyond the earth and beyond the purposes of God in the earth
56:44 -  as desperate as the fulfillment of those purposes are none of them will be fulfilled
56:56 -  either his kingdom in the earth or his purposes in the earth except that we grasp the purpose of God
57:06 -  that go beyond this age and are into the ages to come I don't know how to explain this mystery
57:18 -  I just know it in my spirit and I'm praying that the spirit of it might be exuded upon you it's beyond knowledge
57:32 -  it's got to come directly into your understanding that except that we see when the eye of our understanding is opened
57:44 -  by the grace that is given the eternal purpose of God and the purposes that go beyond this age
57:56 -  and for the ages to come we will not be of any value in this age that's the long and the short of it
58:11 -  either we are going to apprehend and be apprehended by the transcendent and eternal purposes of God
58:25 -  that even go beyond his interest in the earth and beyond his benefits to us his purposes in the earth will not be fulfilled
58:41 -  for God is indivisible we cannot take this part and separate that part the garment that covered Jesus
58:53 -  was without seam it cannot be parted either we take the lamb of God
59:05 -  entire roast with fire the legs and the appurtences thereof or we have him not at all
59:17 -  or we'll have something else we'll call it Christian and we'll employ biblical vocabulary
59:25 -  and we'll have impressive programs and activities people will be happy
59:33 -  be a pleasant religion but they will not be unto him glory in the church
59:43 -  world without ends throughout all ages let's read that again
59:55 -  in order that in the ages to come verse 7 of chapter 2 he might show
01:00:03 -  the surpassing riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus it's not a purpose that has to do with us
01:00:21 -  it's a purpose that has to do with him unto him I don't know why he wants to do it
01:00:31 -  I don't have to know he doesn't have to explain it to me but he wants an eternal satisfaction
01:00:41 -  an eternal gratification he wants to show something to the principalities and powers
01:00:49 -  that have opposed him time without end the surpassing riches of his grace toward us in kindness
01:01:05 -  he's going to say look at this Jew arrogant sensualist
01:01:13 -  dark in his mind an enemy of God look at this one
01:01:21 -  he was a murderer and a persecutor I made him the chief apostle of the church look at these people
01:01:31 -  they were nothing in the world they were torn, they were broken they were scarred and disfigured
01:01:39 -  they lived in the spirit of the world in anger and vexation and competition and striving
01:01:51 -  but look at the grace of my kindness but look at the grace of my kindness look at what it has performed
01:02:02 -  look at these Jews and gentiles together who were historically at each other's throats full of fear and apprehension toward each other
01:02:18 -  I've not just brought them together in a little kind of shallow ecumenicity I've made of them one new man
01:02:28 -  look at these blacks and whites a whole continent was threatened with fire and blood
01:02:40 -  and I've made of them one new man have you ever seen anything more glorious than my church
01:02:51 -  look at the beauty of it the truth of it the purity of it
01:02:59 -  the authenticity of it it's a heavenly phenomenon it's above culture and language and time
01:03:09 -  it dwells in the eternal look at its authority and its power nations are compelled to acknowledge it
01:03:18 -  it is a standard in the earth and I'm going to exhibit it throughout all the ages
01:03:30 -  and the ages to come to show my surpassing riches God has purposes for us that go beyond us
01:03:54 -  we must see them something must be revealed by a grace which is given
01:04:04 -  that changes everything that breaks our feathers that looses us from our petty considerations
01:04:18 -  our small religious ambitions and gives us the motivation the strength, the passion
01:04:28 -  to go on in the fulfillment of this and I know that there are ministers in this room
01:04:38 -  who are often discouraged even as I myself am and say what's the point
01:04:47 -  it's so futile we see no consequence of our speaking all things remain as they were
01:04:55 -  but I pick up the book and I catch the sense of God's purpose and I know he's going to fulfill it
01:05:07 -  because he has said it and I'm encouraged and I can go on
01:05:13 -  we need the vision of God for the purpose of God if we are to fulfill it
01:05:23 -  unto glory and for this reason God is now revealing
01:05:31 -  bringing to light that which has been hidden in God and is now being revealed
01:05:40 -  that through the church the apostolic church true church
01:05:52 -  the eternal purposes of God will be fulfilled when this takes hold of us
01:06:04 -  we will not need charismatic song leaders if you know what I mean where certain kinds of praise
01:06:16 -  needs to be simulated or effected we cannot contain ourselves something is welling up
01:06:28 -  that needs to break forth in such acknowledgement to God for the high calling which is ours
01:06:37 -  in Christ Jesus worth every sacrifice unto him be glory in the church
01:06:51 -  let's bow before him this morning and thank him that he has elected us
01:07:03 -  that we are called to the eternal purposes of God in the church
01:07:15 -  what is our exalted individualism now those little petty distinctions by which we celebrated ourselves
01:07:31 -  our petty insecurities our jealousies and striving it falls away like the
01:07:40 -  dead skin from a snake we see our Christian brothers and sisters in a new light
01:07:52 -  for we are not complete without them until we all come now it is no more
01:08:01 -  a matter of obligatory of obligation of doing the right thing
01:08:09 -  because we are Christians it flows we find ourselves capable
01:08:17 -  of a transcendent generosity an ability to be given to sacrifice that we might be able
01:08:27 -  that we might be one we're lifted above the petty temper of the world
01:08:37 -  for we have apprehended and be apprehended by the eternal purpose of God

01:08:56 -  hallelujah thank you God you just speak out of your heart where you're sitting
01:09:04 -  this is no time for long religious utterances short
01:09:14 -  spirit-unctioned statements of gratitude for the privilege
01:09:21 -  of our high calling in Christ deep gasps and cries of repentance
01:09:33 -  for the pettiness of our previous seeing our church
01:09:45 -  our church our denomination our program
01:09:55 -  breathe in the glory of God and be ruined by it eternally
01:10:19 -  the revelations in your heart silence and he cried out
01:10:48 -  Dawah the Christ and King of Israel or Jesus said
01:10:55 -  you're impressed with this I'll show you a greater thing a ladder ascending
01:11:05 -  from earth to heaven angels and ascending and descending upon the Son of Man
01:11:15 -  have you seen this greater thing no other connection between earth and heaven
01:11:23 -  angels ascending and descending bringing down to men the things that are eternal
01:11:33 -  Jacob awoke from his sleep when he saw this he said this is none other
01:11:41 -  but the house of God and God is in this place and I knew it not
01:11:50 -  how dreadful is this place how full of fear this is none other than the gate
01:12:00 -  to heaven have you seen the greater thing you must see it
01:12:10 -  or you'll never be able to give yourself to it he's not called you to be functionaries in an institutional church

01:12:40 -  upon the Son of Man have you seen the greater thing and fallen before it
01:12:50 -  waken from your sleep God is in this place no other
01:12:58 -  for this is the house of God may it be established in Switzerland and over the face of the earth
01:13:12 -  by apostolic men and women jealous for his glory who will not consider any alternative
01:13:24 -  but the fulfillment of this not only for this age but for the ages to come
01:13:36 -  my house shall be called the house of sacrifice this is more than a few francs in the collection plate it will require all our life
01:13:50 -  all our being and it was for this reason that we're called to be saved out of our sins
01:14:00 -  but to be saved into his purposes hallelujah transact something with God now
