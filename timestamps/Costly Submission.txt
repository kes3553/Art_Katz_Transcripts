Costly Submission

00:00 -  minor affliction, but all the more, Lord, whatever weakness that has brought, that that would give greater opportunity for the expression of your strength. So we are made strong, my God, in you, and we're so jealous over this word. Trust that it's your jealousy and that
00:27 -  nothing shall be lost to your people whom you've assembled and beyond and through them to the larger congregation, the church, that a statement will come forth, Lord, and of a continuing kind for what you gave us yesterday. That was precious. I've been around for almost 40 years. I would say
00:46 -  yesterday was remarkably precious, and we just invite you to continue and bring that perspective, my God, to such a peak and to dot the i's, cross the t's, show us its application, its implications, and whatsoever you will. We're so privileged, Lord. What shall we say to you?
01:07 -  So privileged. So come and have your full sway. Thank you, my God, for your thoughts that are so unspeakably precious, full of wisdom and understanding and on time. So be with this piece of dust, Lord, and let your children not only hear your words, but your voice. We thank
01:44 -  and give you praise in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, among my many books, if I indulge anything, it's the purchase of books, and Inge says, are you going to read them all? When will you ever read them? Well, I said they're there positionally, so at any moment the Lord can finger what he wills,
02:07 -  and I'll have it, the accessibility. I can't tell you what a privilege to have the complete work of Carl Bott, 14 volumes of church dogmatics that no man in a single lifetime could ever read, but when someone alludes to a particular volume and you want to follow up that reference, there
02:30 -  it is at your fingertips on the shelf, so I'm appreciating that. So somehow my eye was directed to a little booklet by Arthur Pink. How many people know that name? Oh, you need to read Arthur Pink's work on David. That's a, what can you say, milestone work. He's a British preacher, teacher,
02:54 -  Bible commentator, and here's his little book on the Ten Commandments, and so I thought, what has he to say on the commandment, thou shalt honor thy mother and thy father, beside the thought that God would include that is a statement in itself of all the things for which we could be commanded
03:18 -  that had sufficient priority in the wisdom and understanding of the Most High that it was included. I believe it's the fifth, and right after the fourth, keeping the Shabbat. So here are the foundational thunderclap statements of God, not only for the believing community,
03:37 -  but for all mankind. One day, when every knee shall bend and every mouth confess that Jesus is Lord, the whole world will subscribe to the law and the commandments of righteousness of God, of which this will be a center. That somehow, because it's included, is the testimony in itself
03:56 -  that it bears with him an uncommon weight that we would never give it as earthlings. And the proof of that is the way in which parental authority is not only ignored but despised in our time. And as you'll see, as I just share with you some of his comments, particularly when it
04:18 -  pertained to youth, when he says, let us consider the duties of children to their parents. They are to love and reverence them, being fearful of offending due to respect they bear them. A genuine filial veneration is to actuate children so that they abstain from whatever would grieve or offend
04:38 -  their parents. In that one statement, we have the whole divine alternative to adolescent promiscuity and to children having children and the whole spate of illegitimacy that is one of the foundational data of our time is the promiscuity, the sexual ease with which the children of our generation
05:08 -  fornicate. Why? Because they have no fear, because they're not concerned about whether or not they offend their parents. So when I read that, I thought, wow, here was God's provision and so great wisdom to put a restraint on the youthful passions that cloy and clamor for
05:30 -  indulgence and that God's provision is you shall honor your father and your mother, and if something would offend them, you deny yourself that gratification. That the issue of not offending the parents from your call to honor is a sufficient deterrent to
05:49 -  any invitation or disposition to indulge your flesh. So in the absence of that, it is so clearly and conspicuously absent in our time. Children are enemies to their parents under their own rules. They mock them. If you read some of the confessions that shooting in Colorado at that high school
06:14 -  and one of the young ladies who was not a victim, but she was turned back to the Lord by the demonstration of the faith of one who did suffer death, and she writes her biography and it's loaded with rebellion against parents, witchcraft and curses and voodoo. It's unbelievable the vehemence
06:39 -  and the vitriolic hatred of this middle-class Protestant girl against loving Christian parents who gave no rise, no occasion. This isn't an instance of child neglect or child abuse. These are loving parents and yet she with another friend were meeting privately in nursing and
06:59 -  cultivating and brooding in this demonic way against their parents. It's the spirit of the age and it's contrary, of course, to the wisdom and the counsel of God. So we need to know when we read the statistics of illegitimate children, of children having children,
07:21 -  the root cause of it is the failure to honor thy father and thy mother. And he says that this commandment is not only to the literal father and mother, but it is to be applied to all our superiors. The end of the precept is that since the Lord God desires the
07:42 -  preservation of the order he has appointed, the degree of preeminence fixed by him ought to be inviolably preserved. I don't know if you can catch this as it's read, can you? But it'll be on the tape and every good writer writes so compactly that it's hard to follow and hear it because
08:05 -  another consequence of our generation is that we've lost an appreciation for words, words that bear weight and concept. There's so much blab that when someone says something in a pointed way we're unable to appropriate. I'll read it again.
08:24 -  He's saying that this commandment is rooted in the necessity to preserve order and if the respect for the structure that is inherent in creation out of the wisdom of God is neglected, you'll have chaos, you'll have anarchy, you'll have devastation, and that's what
08:45 -  we're having. From every level, from the home to society, where the respect for order, the respect for authority has declined, there you see the onrush of every kind of collapse of order. So the end of the precept is that since the Lord desires the preservation of the order
09:07 -  he has appointed, this is the divine order. This isn't some human construct of something that we think will have a certain efficacy and keep things going. This is the divine order out of the divine wisdom and the commandment given to see to
09:24 -  its preservation is thou shalt honor and the father and the mother is a statement not only for your actual parents but any expression of those in the place of a superior authority, from a policeman to an elder to the judge to the president. I don't know if you've observed the
09:44 -  cartoons and the way in which President Bush is depicted in cartoons. I think basically he's not a bad-looking guy, but those cartoons are such a disfigurement. And by the way, the process by which Jews ended up in the ovens began earlier with disparaging comments in German newspapers
10:06 -  about Jewishness and of a tinctured anti-Semitic kind that became increasingly bold until it became flagrant and then cartoons of Jews virtually with horns, beards, hook-nosed, avaricious, greedy, lustful, protect your blonde daughters from these monsters
10:28 -  so that the disparagement of the Jew that made him a candidate for the oven because he no longer was human but subhuman began through a process of demeaning that began in the press through editorials through comments and through cartoons. We're seeing that now with Bush and occasionally
10:48 -  we see it with a reference to evangelical Christianity, that the fundamentalists are becoming the ogres and the resistance of progress and we will be depicted in a kind of a caricatured kind until we will be candidates for concentration camps or ovens.
11:08 -  So all of that is a statement of disorder and disrespect and a lack of honoring. I remember saying to my younger son one day in his adolescent displeasure, he came down, he didn't say a word and I took a look at him and I said, fix your face.
11:28 -  I'm not going to allow you to wear that expression. Merely because you have not verbalized it is not a reason that I can ignore what your face is saying and for me to ignore that comment and that statement is to encourage you to to allow yourself to fester and to brood on that resentment.
11:48 -  Fix your face and you know the remarkable thing was he instantly fixed his face. He put away that spiteful, angry, resentment, sneering kind of thing and took on upon himself But most parents would not ever make an issue of it. So long as it hasn't erupted to the verbal level
12:07 -  of outright resistance or what's the word rebellion, they kind of look the other way. There's a fear. What a remarkable reversal. Instead of children fearing their parents with filial respect, parents are fearing their children.
12:24 -  What's the word? They don't want to push the issue and so they ignore to look the other way but it's an issue that cannot be denied. And our unwillingness to exert our authority invites a greater resentment because it may well be that if we knew the cause of youthful
12:43 -  and adolescent rebellion, it's an instinctive and intuitive code of conduct that we can use to youthful and adolescent rebellion. It's an instinctive and intuitive complaint and cry against the failure for us to express the authority that they crave and need to have
12:59 -  that we're unwilling to express. So the moment I said fix your face in the authority which is mine as father, which is an authority reflective of what is given me in the divine order, he instantly obeyed. So I hadn't thought to say all these things but the best things that issue from
13:20 -  the other things that I hadn't thought to say. So I hope that there's some practical value for parents in this room and others who'll be hearing these statements. So he says we should render honor, obedience, and gratitude to anyone who's a father or holds
13:41 -  a position of superiority or authority in the order of God. But this precept is exceedingly repugnant to the depravity of human nature whose ardent desire of exaltation or self-exaltation will scarcely admit of subjection. Praise God for British writers. If they convey no other virtue
14:06 -  than to show us how to use the English language, that's reason enough. That's English folks. I want you to know that you're sitting on a great repository and a great treasure that is suffering neglect and erosion and corrosion because you're not employing words with significant meaning.
14:25 -  So let's have less babble, less blah blah blah blah, and fewer words but with more precise speaking and meaning and content. Listen to this. This precept, honor thy father and thy mother, is exceedingly repugnant to the depravity of human nature. Don't think because your kids have tagged
14:49 -  along to church and are joining the youth section that that's the statement that they are born again by the Spirit of God. There's a lot of pseudo conversion and feigned Christianity, even feigned spirituality, which means that the Adamic nature is still regnant, is still on the throne, still
15:11 -  in charge, and it will be that this commandment to that nature will be exceedingly repugnant because it's the ardent desire of the Adamic nature for self-exaltation which will scarcely admit of subjection. To bend and to bow and to submit is that the real nexus of whatever remains
15:34 -  in us that is Adamic. And when I gave that first statement last year on the 10th of Shem and that it was God's provision for Japheth, for Japheth left to himself unattended because of his the enlargement which his name means would be a vehicle for destruction which World War II and World War I
15:54 -  have clearly revealed. But in order for Japheth to enjoy the benefit of Shem and whatever attends Shem and the environment in which Shem dwells because he's ever living and having his being in and before God, the whole issue of being a Shem is what Paul says at the conclusion of
16:14 -  Romans 11, for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever. You want to know what a definition of a son of Shem is? One who lives for that alone. A son of Shem is his every thought, conduct, action, breath and being is of him through him and for him to
16:38 -  whom belongs glory forever. Well I'll tell you what just to be close to anyone who lives like that has got to be a blessing. Anything that would exude from such a one whether he speaks or is silent has got to confer some kind of valence of heavenly things and that's the blessing God
17:00 -  intends for Shem that will change him. It will mediate, take the rough, more than take the rough edges off, making the full human being that in his enlargement can be a blessing and not a threat and even a blessing to Shem himself. So what's the catch? You have to bow to enter the tent.
17:22 -  There's the tent but you have to break your stiff posture and bend and bow in order to enter and when I gave that invitation all hell broke loose because whatever was Adamic, whatever yet remained in man balked and expressed what he writes here. It was exceedingly repugnant
17:45 -  because this exaltation of man will scarcely admit a subjection of bowing. So may we be, what's the word, not just flexible, pliant. Here's a good, you guys getting some good English words here. Pliant that means are ever disposed to bow. When there's a choice in the
18:07 -  matter of whether you should stiffen and resist or bow and submit, choose to bow. Take the likely error of bowing rather than the error of resisting. Always to be pliant, always disposed before God to yield. Even when we're right, we're wrong. There's a precious word that
18:29 -  came up a year or two ago out of Karl Barth that catches the spirit of when you're right, you're wrong. It'll come to me later but I thought if the church could be characterized by that word and that disposition, that spirit, what a witness. And you know where the word was born?
18:50 -  It's in English language but it came to me in a message in New Zealand over the issue of who really owns New Zealand. The Maori's, the indigenous people who were there some perhaps thousands of years before the advent of white settlers and though they were primitive in their
19:07 -  civilization and in their culture and the white men came just like the story of the American Indian here within a couple of generations. They had built their cities and affected the economy and done more with that native soil than ever the Maori's had done who were a hunting and fishing
19:24 -  primitive community. So now the issue in the 20th century is whose land is it really? The white settlers who have developed it and obtained a commercial and economic progress are those who were there before you. Only the wisdom of Solomon could give an answer to a question of that kind
19:43 -  but it's a question that haunts the earth. This is not just New Zealand, it's also Australia, it's also the United States of America. Wherever racial consciousness is being increased the issue is the conflict between the colonizer and those who were there before. And so
20:03 -  the Lord said something like don't be insistent upon your claim whether you are a Maori or a New Zealander but even if you're right in your claim you're wrong. Defer to the other and
20:18 -  accommodate and condescend and bow before the other one because I think it would do more to because I think it would do more to erase Maori rage their indignation at white exclusion and white superiority by white men bowing not necessarily to concede the nation to the Maori's
20:42 -  but to give to this people a measure of respect and honoring to the point where they might be so effective as to say you know it's really not all that matter much of a question anyway of who really in fact owns it we in fact have really prospered by what you have done in your enlargement in your
21:01 -  Japheth use of the land so let's even forget whose it is and let's enjoy what God has given together your attitude toward me has broken my resistance toward you. There's something about submission that is so precious but as Peter says to women in first
21:22 -  Peter 3 submit yourselves to your husbands with a chaste how do you say with a quiet spirit with a meek and quiet spirit yeah which means that it's not a submission by which you clench your teeth and stop your indignation against this guy because you're so much superior
21:47 -  to him you're so much more spiritual than he is he's a clod and he'll spend all day in front of a tv set watching a football game and you would much rather ruminate over the scriptures and you ought to submit to him so you have everything that contends against what God requires but he
22:07 -  requires it okay I'll do it but I'll do it with clenched teeth but God says accept that it's with a quiet and meek spirit which in his sight is of great price it's not submission at all in order for a woman to really be submitted to a clod like that which by
22:22 -  the way would be the very release of the man to move him from the foot from the tv set to the Bible is the demonstration that issues from his wife when it's authentic but for her for it to be authentic is the issue of the cross bowing and going down before another is death it's the cross
22:44 -  and the evidence of whether or not that has been truly affected is whether what issues from you is a quiet and meek spirit or just the quietness that comes because you have clamped your mouth shut so
23:00 -  it reminded me of a text that you want to turn to Luke chapter 2 of an example of the Lord Himself in what honoring father and mother to be in the same place that you are in the same place that you are in the same place that you are in the same place that you are in the same place that you are in
23:19 -  of an example of the Lord Himself in what honoring father and mother means which was interestingly the first message that i gave at a prophetical school of some four or five years ago which i thought was a complete flop i thought look what a minor note to sound
24:01 -  is that the way you're going to ring in an historic prophetical school every school has got to be historic and the message was from Luke 2 51 when Jesus had gone up with his family to Jerusalem for the Passover and then disappeared
24:22 -  they don't they didn't recognize his absence until they were on their return and of course they were panic-stricken where is our son and went back and inquired here and there and finally they found him and when they saw him at verse 48 they were amazed and his mother said
24:40 -  unto him son why hast thou dealt with thus why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me didn't you know that i must be about my father's business here's a son of shem speaking there's
25:01 -  only one purpose for my life it's to honor and glorify the father didn't you know and they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them how dense can you be after the visitation of angels and yet to miss the clear meaning that issued from this boy's mouth
25:24 -  and but here's the punch line verse 51 he went down with them he went down with them because Jerusalem of course is the probably one of the greatest heights in in Israel elevated so they go up to Jerusalem for the three occasions which in which the men of Israel are to attend to the
25:45 -  lord on the three feast occasions Passover being one and then when you return to your place you go down but you know the way we prophetically read that statement he went down with them he submitted himself to them all the more galling when they couldn't even understand
26:02 -  the simplicity of his statement didn't you know that i have to be about my father's business why were you concerned and apprehensive and anxious is this what i'm going to have to live with that i have to give you an explanation every time i'm called to some obedience
26:16 -  if this is the way it's going to be i can't cut that that's not an atmosphere in which i can thrive and come into my full messianic being that's what we would have said but that's not what he said he went down with them is more than just descending to the altitude
26:34 -  of nazareth is going down in humiliation to live with parents who will not understand you how would you like to live with a husband who cannot understand you how would you like to live with a wife who cannot understand you and wish that you were some other kind of preacher and funny
26:51 -  like like so-and-so and why do you get people aggravated and and all but he went down and i i would submit that his going down was the key as the scripture will show us to the whole sending forth of the fully mature son of God at this critical juncture
27:17 -  he went down with them and came to nazareth of course what's nazareth nazareth nazareth is scumsville nazareth is the bottom of the barrel can any good thing come out of nazareth not only does he return with them but but to where does he return to a city whose reputation
27:32 -  is a stink and was subject unto them and that precious whether he's understood or not understood he's he was subject unto them because his subjection unto them was not predicated upon their understanding of him or his call
27:56 -  they had not to display any virtue any particular quality they were simply parents and God said honor thy father and thy mother and he was subject unto them all the more significant when the parents don't understand that kind of submission will yield a greater spiritual reward
28:18 -  than submission that is easier to give because the parents are in tune with you and do understand so if you're facing a circumstance like that whether it's on the job under your roof in your marriage with children relationship there's a greater spiritual value to be subject to that one
28:36 -  and to that condition that circumstance because it's difficult then it would be if it were accommodating accommodating
28:52 -  verse 52 and Jesus increased in wisdom wow is that just a little this verse follows that verse or is it that this verse follows the spiritual logic of that verse he was subject unto them and Jesus increased you want to increase increase by subjection increase by bowing
29:15 -  don't increase by self-assertion and by striving that's the spirit of the world it's not the spirit of shem Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and with man so there we have the example of a young Jesus
29:37 -  honoring his father by honoring his father by being subject by going down down here he says that the king david after he was anointed for the throne by samuel fulfilled his father's appointment by tending his sheep he didn't come and say look dad up
30:01 -  till now i didn't mind this it's stinky and it swarmed with flies and bugs and insects i know that because i tried to go up to a spiritually elevated place when we were um immigrants in Israel years ago i rose early with the rising of the sun i climbed up this thorny
30:21 -  side in galilee to find a place to sit on the rock and look out over the galilean landscape and news upon God and there was the droppings of the sheep evidently the the palestinian shepherds had taken their flocks up over those hills and wherever the droppings were flies were
30:41 -  and when that sun came up and what got warm those flies were all around me and i started to get bitten and i had welts on my legs the size of a silver dollar and i lost all my spiritual inspiration so i can see that samuel having come in anointed and said you're God's choice you're the chosen
31:00 -  when you're you're the king of Israel he would come the next day and say to his dad i have to submit my resignation for me to for me to continue to tend sheep after this would be uncomplimentary to the magnitude of the call that has come to me sure son not a word not a
31:17 -  wimp and not a complaint he went back to the sheep not precious you have to pray for me i guess i'm getting mellow in my older years that kind of stuff touches me i love that and it's exactly that quotient that dimension of things that i feel is so absent from our abrasive christianity
31:40 -  because even when we're right we're right and we want the other guy to know it no matter what kind of faction and friction it will cause this is this is a spirit this is the spirit of the son of shan he went back to his sheep he went down to nazareth and he was subject
31:56 -  unto them pray for the restoration of the ten commandments and the fifth in a special way so children ought to harken to their instructions and to imitate their God the Godly practices of their parents their language must ever be respectful and their gestures be token submission
32:21 -  whoo where are you coming from brother are you on the face of the earth that you would request and expect that this is a realistic expectation for children of our generation even in christian homes that their language should be respectful i know of instances where christian parents are
32:41 -  cursed by their children and called every filthy name in the book and somehow the parents take it and bear it i don't call that love so he says that if you're going to honor this commandment your language must be respectful and not only your language but your gestures must be token
33:02 -  submission you mustn't stiffen your back and you'll take out the garbage but you'll let it know be known that though you're taking it out you're taking it out under uh what's the word under complaint under under the rest because you've got to know let your demeanor and your your posture
33:24 -  indicate that this is an act of submission that's genuine and heartfelt so bring your body into compliance as well as your mouth and then you'll be honoring the commandment and it speaks of joseph that when he was long separated from his father jacob and jacob came
33:43 -  to egypt where joseph had now risen to such a state of excellency over the entire land that not seeing his father all those years he says he bowed himself with his face to the ground before his father i think that the text may say three times
34:01 -  to the ground before his father i think that the text may say three times this is again not a little gesture of uh culture this is heartfelt depth deep recognition of the respect to his father and that had not had opportunity to be expressed over a long
34:23 -  separation he bowed with his face to the ground can you imagine any kid in our generation doing that to a father or mother in our time or the equivalent and then he reminds us that the wick of the wicked it is written they are not afraid to speak
34:47 -  speak evil of dignitaries why are they wicked because they're turning their back on the very clear commandment of God to honor authority by speaking evil of of dignitaries people in authority and they're not afraid then the issue of not being afraid of it is not the issue of being afraid of
35:08 -  the dignitaries it's not being afraid of God there's the want of Godly reverence and fear of the God who has spoken and the God who has given commandments established his priorities and has communicated to mankind what are the essential recognitions that must be maintained
35:25 -  if order is to be maintained and that there would be an habitation that is appropriate to men that i've created in my image this goes all the way back to God respectful authority is the respect for God disrespect for man and the expression of that has at its root an indignation
35:45 -  and a disrespect for the for God who established this order so strictly has God enjoined them to quiet submission to their masters he's speaking now about slaves that even when a servant has given no just cause for rebuke yet he is to silently
36:04 -  suffer the groundless anger of his master talk about equal rights and uh what do they call it to give negro students and the place of preference of the university systems affirmative action is completely contrary to what Paul has written of how a servant in a submitted and inferior
36:28 -  relationship is to relate to his master not ever is there a whisper or an intimation by Paul or by Jesus that a man who's subject to slavery should rise against it but to submit to that condition and the scripture says in whatsoever condition you're called therein remain even if it's the
36:51 -  condition of slavery because in that relationship you have perhaps more opportunity to glorify God the father than if you were in a free condition how you relate to your master in subjection will give more occasion to display the grace of God in you which is to say God as God then if
37:11 -  you were free just to be your own master and call your own shots therefore remain in that condition but in that condition don't murmur don't complain don't retaliate certainly don't use violence to extricate yourself nor employ it in speech nor even exhibit an attitude of contempt to the master
37:33 -  because he's misusing his privileged superiority over you in a way to be abusive bear it well i have to say at this point there's a black brother and i came to his home on one of my trips he was the head of a fellowship and i don't know how it came up in conversation but i think the lord was
37:54 -  already turning these thoughts over in my own spirit i said the greatest thing you can do for the black church he was complaining about the congregation the larger congregation where he was a member how hokey it was and that the minister was a kind of a prima donna who was a flashy dresser
38:15 -  and had expensive wardrobe and demanded and required all kinds of attention and the repetitious in his messages i don't know what his complaints were and he wondered whether he should even submit to such a word or go off in some independent direction you know what i said the best thing
38:31 -  you can do for the black church and the black church is desperately in need is be an uncle tom you need to show the black church and the black church needs to show the white church in america what true submission is that the greatest figure in american history in american literature the
38:52 -  most christ-like figure in american literature is uncle tom who patiently bore suffering at the hands of his those in whom he had fallen in slavery and bought and so christ-like a demeanor that he exuded the very radiance of God he condemned an entire generation and likely one
39:15 -  others to the knowledge of God whom he exemplified in his own suffering patience when i suggested to him that the greatest role that he could take upon himself was to become an uncle tom this was a man who was on an upward social mobility he was really coming into professional recognition
39:36 -  with a salary of an appropriate kind his own home and every instinct in every impulse in a black american who has known any degree in measure of deprivation because of his race yearns instinctively to show the other guy who has clamped him down that he could be his equal
39:56 -  not only his equal but play the game better than he and succeed at it better than he to tell such a man who's already tasting this success why don't you forsake that and take on a deeper call and uh walk in the role of an uncle tom you know what that man did he went down on the kitchen
40:18 -  floor in slobbering tears he wept like a baby because he knew that what was coming to him was not a human suggestion but a divine call and he could not receive it he cried like a grown man weeping because the call was greater than anything he could have conceived he would
40:42 -  serve God at any level he'll be he'll have it he'll be himself a minister a shepherd he'll have and he did have a small body of souls connected with him he was a teacher and he'll do this he'll serve but to forsake this identity of equality and to voluntarily choose to come into a submitted
41:04 -  relationship of that which was known in the earliest time of slavery and that that somehow will will be a convey the greatest sense of the reality of the kingdom to a generation who have not known it therefore i'm unwilling the end of the story is not long after he ran off with one
41:28 -  of the young women in the small circle of souls of which he was the overseer the entire fellowship was devastated the marriage ended in divorce the children are devastated how are out of the faith and only the lord will know the consequences of what has taken place and i'm not saying
41:48 -  that his rejection of the call led automatically to a sexual transgression and to the collapse of the fellowship and marriage and so on but i wouldn't put it past God i wouldn't say it could not be related and when a call comes of an ultimate kind and you'll not submit yourself and
42:10 -  subject yourself and go down and bow to receive that that the arrogance that keeps you from that acknowledgement and submission will have its consequence in the other areas and aspects of your life you know something the way some people see uncle toms is
42:32 -  having never read the book uncle tom we see uncle tom black see uncle toms as people that submit to the fight man in the sense that they they tell on others in other words he's sort of a one that's that's weak he's uh an uncle tom in my view is one that's weak and he'll
42:57 -  he leans he fears the white man so he tells and rats on the other people and not someone that's submitted in a christ-like view right so the black view of an uncle tom is totally different from reading the book i'm glad you said that that means that that man if you would assume that call
43:18 -  knows that he's going to be abjectly misunderstood that's right he'll be understood in the way that the phrase uncle tom has come to be understood by black people as sellout as cop out but and yet willing to do it knowing that you're going to be misunderstood would be the greater
43:37 -  submission to God and the greater virtue so yes bowing before God is costly yeah even in the sense that uh like you're saying john the baptist said be content with your wages don't ask for a raise i had an opportunity to do that
43:59 -  but so it's and you had a take out on slavery which was real good what's the name of that tape i can't remember the name of it but uh simon has it and those it's a real good oh that's yeah it goes with this one oh i'm just saying oh you need to
44:15 -  collect it because thank you for reminding me you know where that message was spoken of all places in russia i don't know if oleg was there it was the first message when brother Paul had collected those ministers and um before the lord i don't know what to speak what do you say to these men
44:35 -  in a place of being ministers in russia with the threat of a renaissance of communism again what's the word so you begin by beginning and what was the word Paul's word uh i forgot in what book it's like a minor note i was almost embarrassed to speak it i said this is a little
44:56 -  minor Paul speaking about widows and slaves i said but that little pinprick of a hole emits a light of the deepest kind in the revelation of what it means to be apostolic Paul's attitude about slaves and about widows was a minuscule view of the macrocosm of what
45:19 -  apostolicity is you know what happened after that they never came to another meeting they never came to another meeting and so all of the morning meetings for ministers were nothing and at night we had public meetings they didn't even come to the public meetings
45:37 -  though they were anointed because of the offense of that word about Paul and his attitude toward widows and slaves and i think that the the the thing that turned them off was this they're expecting some really high power or a statement from an american speaker speak on how to succeed
45:55 -  as ministers how do you do it you guys are doing it in america you've got big churches and and great budgess and now let us know so here comes this jerk talking about Paul on slavery and and widows was a complete disappointment and disillusionment and the rejection which indicates that even though
46:18 -  as ministers they did not respect the authority of this servant prophetically and that in respecting they would say we don't understand why God would have chosen as esoteric a subject as this that has no visible relevance to our situation in russia but we have to assume that if you bear
46:41 -  this kind of place in God and have this kind of calling that what issues from you is from God and he will later show us the significance of that at any rate we will not allow our indignation to have such sway as to cut you off completely hereafter in that they have written what shall i say death
47:04 -  sentence on their own ministries certainly it's got to have an implication for all their future because when you reject the prophetic way the prophetic man it's often God's last provision and what follows in the history of Israel is judgment
47:21 -  and so i i don't want to surmise what the consequence would have been just remembering maybe simon can help me here the when you returned from that trip to russia you brought that word in our living room that following sunday your first sunday back
47:41 -  with us and it was i remember you concluded the message with this statement embrace your chains and it was a glorious gush of the spirit of God one of my favorite messages that you spoke on a regular sunday with us but it came out of that simon just to commend that tape to some of these
47:58 -  that are here what was the name of that did you call it widows and slaves 190 get the price has just gone up yeah because it's so richly developed what's only being touched here once one statement i would like to also suggest you write down i wrote it down
48:22 -  and i found art using the exact word that i was writing which he had not used before so because of that and a little bit of uh call it superstition on my part i was writing this statement call of an ultimate kind requires that one bow in costly submission at the very moment
48:40 -  i was writing the word costly art was saying costly and so i would urge that you underline the word costly the call of a call of ultimate of the of an ultimate kind requires that one bow in costly submission if it's not costly you can well question whether it's submission at all
48:58 -  it's got to be costly it's got to run across the natural grain of your own life and preference and disposition or it's not submission and the and the true affecting of that submission is not something that you can perform out of
49:17 -  well-meaning intention or charismatic religiosity it has got to be the grace of God it has got to be the life of God and you know what this is the nature of that life the nature of the life of God is to be submitted can you believe that the most high God the creator of the heavens and the
49:38 -  earth has as the most intrinsic disposition of his own nature submittedness he gave himself without spot and blemish as a sacrifice the last act of Jesus is the summation of all of Jesus and all of Jesus is the summation of all of God the father he demonstrated what is the nature of
50:03 -  the father who stands at the door of a heart and knocks so you cannot perform this without the grace of God the grace of God is the life of God and the life of God is not only the enablement but it in the enablement is the expression of the character of that life so when you
50:26 -  submit in true submission with a quiet and big spirit something is being expressed a very God himself that that husband though he is not submitted to the word will will nevertheless bow to God without the word by the demonstration of the chaste and obedient wife who is without fear
50:47 -  not a remarkable statement and that's not not only a statement for wives that's the statement for the church in its final and eternal identity as the bride of christ are we going to be a bride adorned for this bridegroom whose very nature is submission when we ourselves shall come with some
51:07 -  kind of residue of self-exaltation and reservation and indignation and you can't tell me and i it's a it's an incompatible match so God has got to deal with us in this life and fit us in this life to come to that purity of the that woman that bride the heart of which is
51:32 -  expressed in first p to three okay just off the top of my head i'm trying to think what would be the most galling requirement that God can make of a church in demonstration of this kind of willingness to be submitted or subjected to another then being submitted and subjected to the jew
51:54 -  to bow before a spiritual inferior who is even outside the faith and has not yet come to the recognition of Jesus and yet that God would require of us will be blessed to see that we have a disposition toward this people of a truly submitted kind respecting them because they are
52:12 -  the fathers of our faith who are in present darkness think of that maybe you can think of some greater requirement but i think for most christians that would be galling what how can i ask this maybe not galling when you consider jews in the abstract but when you consider jews
52:32 -  in their actuality it's another story as you can find out from any person in the venezuel community who waited on my mother here in the year that she was with us before her death it was galling for me and i'm jewish and i'm her son but when this 96 year old lady is telling me
52:53 -  who already is a senior citizen i'll do this she's barking out orders at me as if i'm some 10 year old little snot nose kid that can be bandied about hey my dignity my age my car i have i have to say i felt the chafing the lord let me know that there's a residue that yet remains
53:19 -  with me with my own jewish mother as a jew how then will it be for gentiles with jews who are alien to them when when they should when they shall have to bear the same kind of irritableness that we got from my mother barking orders and this is not going to know for how about this or that
53:38 -  how will they take it what will issue from them from their blind side when they're hit with that kind of relationship for which they've had no preparation what will they exhibit at that moment will be altogether telling and historically and eternally significant
53:57 -  because the final episode of the whole redemptive drama of Israel is what they encounter in the wilderness of their final uprooting and being casted through the nations when God says in ezekiel 20 i will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations face to face and there you will
54:18 -  come under the rod of my authority and come into the dimensions of my covenant something is being scheduled the final conclusion to the drama is an encounter by jews in their final flight in the time of jacob's trouble in the wilderness when God will meet with them but meet with them face to face
54:42 -  they'll not be looking at surly gentile faces who are screwing up their their their confidence is how long do i have to suffer this these people are terrible they mean spirited and their language is vile you hear an old lady 96 cursing
55:03 -  who gives to the benet breath into hadassah and every kind of jewish cause well these God has seen to it that we're going to be severely thoroughly tested in the greatest test that can come to us to come to us from the adversary of
55:20 -  our faith the enemies of the gospel for our sake so know that it's coming and that it cannot be met on any imagined ground but authenticity itself which is a synonym for that which is apostolic to show forth the nature of God when they shall press us and test us and after we have extended
55:41 -  ourselves to them in kindness and find that it's unappreciated and that they have mean things to say when we have expended ourselves at risk you'll have every ingredient that would lend itself to justifying yourself in some explosive rejection well that's the way you're going to be
56:00 -  forget it and if we have come to that we will have missed a moment so you know what dear saints it would not be uh exaggeration to say you need to seize every occasion now in preparation for that one moment because as we said yesterday there comes sometimes in a lifetime
56:22 -  a single moment and in that moment everything is at stake and all is revealed that was the issue in the moment that came with noah's drunkenness and revealed the truth of his sons it's the moment that will come for us in the moment of Israel's final destitution that will reveal the truth of
56:43 -  us and if that truth not be revealed there'll be no jew that will be coming returning to zion with everlasting joy upon their heads it's the issue of their salvation that they will see their God as he is exhibited through us in patient forbearance in subjecting ourselves to them
57:03 -  in all of their unmanly and uncivil behavior when it shall cost us even to make that demonstration can you follow me okay and doesn't the church the body of christ that is the church give ample opportunity almost daily for such response if you're not experiencing it almost in a daily way
57:25 -  you're out of the faith you're out of the context for the faith you're in some kind of of glass house euphoria of unreality that saves you from these humiliating embarrassing and irritating collisions with the saints and with the authority that's in the body we learned this
57:46 -  lesson years ago in the formation of this community where we were so desperately poor living beneath the government's prescribed poverty level that if anything came to us in the mail or by any means we were so desperate for food insulation housing pregnant women with inadequate housing that we
58:06 -  trembled over how any any dollar should be spent and when you're an elder and announced that well we have just received the gift but it's going to be employed for an overseas trip it's like hitting someone in the solar plexus what i've got a pregnant wife here
58:24 -  my my children not being adequately fed they have dental problems they're not lightly clothed and you're going to take that money for an overseas trip that's a luxury that we can't enjoy cats and who are you to say so anyway we had questions about your eldership have you seen your marriage
58:42 -  lately yes every day so yes you know what i'm saying it's the tensions of life together that reveal the very truth of our condition and if that's not happening for you now can you have the spiritual audacity to pray for it lord lead me out of these safe regions
59:04 -  of conventional christendom and bring me into that quality relationship of the kind that you intend by which your redemptive work can take place that when i shall be tested along with the church in the last days by this jewish people in the uh intemperate condition in which they will be
59:23 -  brought by the suddenness of their uprooting and their being again cast through nations we will not be found wanting that they will indeed see in us the face of God and indeed my salvation if you read ben Israel has everything to do with seeing the face of God and this gentile
59:41 -  girl whom i met overseas and brought my whole umbrage and superior jewish superiority intellectual spirit of the bear on this little girl from kansas who's just a little believer on vacation having completed high school and kind enough to walk with me in the path surrounding the city
01:00:01 -  and probing her motives why are you being kind because although i've been a marxist and social activist i didn't know what kindness was and she answered every question well actually it's it's the love of God what a pathetic answer and she kept saying the love of God the love of
01:00:18 -  God as my level scale of indignation rose and finally i thought she said love of she says love of God one more time she's going to get it i'm not going to withhold i'm going to let go that same blast that every christian has received from me in so-called witnessing and i've reduced them
01:00:35 -  to dust so what is this little girl and sure enough she mentions God and said look kid you're a nice girl but i can't stand this God talk answer me a question that no christian has ever been able to answer for me you're talking about God how do you know that he is oh she said without hesitation
01:00:53 -  uh i i know that he is because he lives in me and when she said that the big hulk went down in one sagging collapse in the dust like a felled ox because that word hit me with power i know because and when i finally recovered what hit me what she said was not theological wasn't even intellectual
01:01:18 -  what gave it its power what gave it its power was that she had the face to prove it and i want to say to you dear non-jewish believers i don't call you gentiles because there's been a radical change in that status you're the people of Israel are not jewish people you can't change that
01:01:41 -  generic factor but there's nothing like seeing the face of God through a gentle face for a jew amen that's all i can tell you to see the face of God expressed through snub-nosed freckle face black or is a revelation of the utmost kind the uttermost kind in keeping with the scripture
01:02:05 -  that they have that this is the light that lightens the gentiles and the glory of the people Israel when we see the glory of the people Israel which we have not known as the people Israel in the light that lightens the gentiles we are saved and it's that demonstration which is the
01:02:22 -  capstone in the conclusion of our age for which we need to be in conscious anticipation and willing preparation by letting the lord turn up the juice now tighten the screws now give us those difficult situations now test us now in the areas of subjection submission and that when the time
01:02:41 -  comes and we have to listen to some jew berating us for whom we have extended ourselves at the risk of our life will not so much as even change our face will not so much as lose our affection and esteem for them because it's not predicated on what they are or what they have attained
01:02:59 -  because it's the esteem of God and his love for that people in whatever their condition and therefore it cannot be lost even when they're ungainly can you relate to christians like that now that you'll still accord to them an esteem and an affection independent of their track record
01:03:17 -  and if they fail you in your expectation and in your disappointment you'll there'll be no alteration of your love and esteem so the church is now the fulcrum for all the future if we but recognize it and utilize it which brings me to the next subject
01:03:38 -  what a man will do when he's entirely free to do what he wills is what he in fact is as we said yesterday that opportunity the testing of shim and and japheth to see a helpless naked father where everything that is human wells up in you to take advantage of the weakness of that one
01:04:02 -  that is now displayed in shame and even to elevate yourself at the expense of the fallen one and say well now he's totally discredited i have every right now to come into my own as the son who has come of age and he's had his time and now i will take over and i will be the the object of
01:04:21 -  God's attention and the vehicle of his use that's exactly the temptation that came to the church with the fall of Israel now we will take over they had their chance now they're naked and destitute in their weakness and now we will be and for God and they and we just shunt them to the side
01:04:41 -  that was an historic tragedy and it was only possible because the church of that hour like the church of this hour was not sham like in its character we failed the test and will and will suffer the consequence of that failure even now until we identify with those who committed it
01:05:02 -  as being one with them in that failure and in that sin time does not alter anything nor distance nor history we are with them as christians in that rejection of Israel that was not expressed by shim with his fallen father
01:05:26 -  so there needs to be a release for us that comes by an acknowledgement that we stand guilty with the church that still continues to see itself as the Israel of God still continue in the arrogance against which Paul had warned i would not have you to be even at this
01:05:42 -  mystery brethren lest you become wise in your own conceit and all of our inflated charismatic carryings on pick up any issue of uh what's the magazine charisma and just see the advertisements for the conferences is enough to make you gag the advertisements the the loud
01:06:09 -  bold statements of what they believe that conference is going to be with multi-colored and the array of ministers who are now doctors by the way if you've noticed bishops bishops your stomach nuts when you turn those pages which is reason i don't turn them
01:06:29 -  but it's exactly what again what Paul warned and i think that the root of it is the reaction of the church to the fallen Israel and we'll continue to suffer this arrogance until we acknowledge with brokenness that we missed it at that historic point and that we want to be free
01:06:46 -  of the sins of our fathers and acknowledge and give credit to a people whom God has not cast away who are only temporarily set aside and maybe not the least reason for which they have been temporarily set aside was to test us what will you do when you see them down but not out no it was
01:07:07 -  not out he was only down but that being down was sufficient occasion to test the heart of his sons and Israel's being down has been sufficient occasion to test that of the church and it tested still so the tent of shim was established in the moment of entering the tent of another as
01:07:26 -  one's own there's something about being a mediator of intercession being identification that the son identified with the father in his shame he did not turn away from his father and not gazing on him because of a superior spirituality that cannot be offended understand
01:07:47 -  what i'm saying he wasn't guarding his spirituality that if i look at my father and see him in that despicable condition there'll be some spiritual loss to me you know it was respect not to look upon him in that condition because he was identified with him there but for grace of God go
01:08:02 -  high if my father who is the righteous preacher of his generation and was faithful to God through decades of building the absurdity of an ark and was a preacher to a generation doomed to destruction because it had given itself over to a total iniquity how can i allow this this one instance
01:08:25 -  to discredit the whole faithfulness of a man throughout his lifetime so i have to recognize in that that however faithful he has been yet being man there's a place of vulnerability and weakness to which i myself also am subject being man so my coming into his tent is coming
01:08:50 -  into his situation i'm not just coming for an expediency it's a statement of my identification i'm one with him in the abject condition in which he's fallen that's why when when noah came out of his drunken stupa and he he prophetically made statements it was so out of the heart of God
01:09:08 -  blessed be the God of shen because he recognized that this what his son had done is more than just politeness it's more than just expediency exigency of something that a man would do in a moment out of a kind of religious cleverness it was the very act of God himself God himself would not have done
01:09:28 -  other than what shim did and shim did it by God because his life is of him through him and to him to whom be glory forever i don't think it's too exaggerated to say that the the issue of the tenth of sham the advent of the tenth of sham came by shams act by entering into
01:09:48 -  his father's circumstance his father's shame his father hum his father's humiliation and to cover him if that's true then what is the point of entry for the tenth of sham in the last days in the historical situation to which we are already moving but us sons and daughters of sham
01:10:09 -  entering the tent not of noah but of jewelry and their down and out last day's humiliation they will be stretched out and unbelievably exposed those things that's that civilization and its amenities confer keep from the exposure of the truth of our condition
01:10:32 -  you're living in a penthouse there's something about being rich that covers the truth of your condition you can hedge yourself about by luxury by men bowing before you respecting you for your great cleverness by which your wealth was obtained your library is impressive and is everywhere
01:10:53 -  about you you own objects of art you have antiques you have on your wall millions of dollars worth of paintings that belong in public museums because you've been a collector and can afford it and you have a certain dignity appropriate to your wealth to your station of life on top of
01:11:08 -  that you're you're jewish and you have given millions in charity to the state of Israel and you've endowed the jewish theological seminary so that squirts like me could come and take a course and so on but when that is suddenly stripped here's the point and it will be
01:11:25 -  what is exposed but what had been up to that moment concealed by the amenities of civilization and wealth can you understand we're living in a lie saints the whole world lives in a lie and we're kept from the recognition of the truth of our condition and that's why there's got to be
01:11:43 -  the severest stripping in the last days for the people Israel for how shall they enter into their priestly function and be the blessing to all the families of the earth if they themselves are yet in the place of deception so everything that is contrary to truth has to be removed that is going
01:11:57 -  to happen suddenly we're going to find them in a condition more despicable than what noah experienced they will be exposed and naked and the object of derision and contempt of all the gentile world that is waiting for its opportunity for every gentile that has been chafed at the expense of
01:12:18 -  a jew either in fact or an imagination because of their wealth and because of their success that moves the natural man to envy will finally have this opportunity as canaan and handed to say now you finally got it i'm superior to you you who have always made me feel inferior now i can look
01:12:38 -  down on your public and open disgrace for you are proliferated throughout the world you've been uprooted and you're being cast to all nations and you don't even know what tomorrow will bring and your fortune you've been is done in a day it brings you nothing the exact plight that fell upon
01:12:55 -  german jews in the nazi prime suddenly and overnight who found themselves evicted from their professorships their position as judges in the courts and and publishers of newspapers places of eminence in german society to find themselves not only out of their professions
01:13:14 -  but out of their homes i can't remember what city it was where there's a monument of the jewish of the synagogue that existed in this neighborhood but you ought to see the houses that yet remain in that neighborhood now occupied by germans formerly occupied by jews
01:13:33 -  that had room for their servants i mean they lived well beautifully luxuriously but overnight it was stripped and removed and the same ones found themselves with their hair shorn their clothing removed and finally in the death even their gold fillings removed and all that they had
01:13:53 -  was a number they were deprived even of the dignity of the identification of a name in fact have experienced or sensed some kind of inferior status to the jew to finally have a vengeance and to enjoy that falling condition the only non-jew who will not share that global
01:14:15 -  celebration of the of jewish fullness will be the church because like sham they will come into that tent like sham they will share an identification with the fallen one because if we don't we can't cover them don't think that covering them is some kind of clinical thing that we can perform by
01:14:33 -  just draping something covering is a divine act but it cannot be performed without an identification with a stricken one all right how lindsey in his book the road to holocaust asked the question could the atrocities of nancy europe have ever taken place in a europe that had not been had not
01:14:58 -  cultivated that uh well you'll know it by the name replacement theology that perspective was in a way uncovering Israel exposing it to the free access of the powers of the air that was working through that german government and just quickly uh there's a cryptic passage it's in daniel chapter 11 where
01:15:18 -  it uses this revealing phrase and it's not even a matter of particularly of context or exegetical meaning but just captures the spirit of this it says uh and this is the uh the revealing messenger speaking to daniel it says the robbers of your people will establish themselves or exalt themselves
01:15:34 -  to establish the vision and of course the daniel's vision was the vision of the kingdom of God which john of course told us would last for a thousand years hitler's whole spirit was to read to restore the third rite that would rule a thousand years the people who have exalted
01:15:51 -  themselves to establish the vision will be seen again in the last day's siege of jerusalem when antichrist will lead his forces to again occupy the place of God's rest and and usurp that holy hill from its appointed calling and destiny and so there's something deep even in the church
01:16:10 -  in its uncovering that has permitted this exposure that has has left Israel to the ravages of the powers of the air without a without a prophetic protest even so and there's something in which the church also has fulfilled that role of exalting themselves to establish the vision and also
01:16:30 -  then not in the same way that the germans were the robbers of your people confiscating their goods to the point of this arab word that he used but how about the way in which the church has exalted itself to establish the vision when the whole book of daniel opens with the promise that this will be
01:16:45 -  given not to another people this is the people through that God is appointed through whom that the vision will be established and it is a presumption and a usurpation of the highest order that the church has stumbled into in their triumphal replacement
01:17:06 -  to show that we're not talking out of our hats or that this is a mere theorizing or just a perspective that's particularly dear to us in some subjective way but that it is all together grounded in scripture i want us to examine one text briefly before the break in psalm 102
01:17:28 -  you can get the tape where we have spoken on this subject at greater length but and read this text at your own leisure carefully because the first half of the text sounds like a psalmist in a concentration camp describing almost in vivid terms exactly what you suffered in the nazi time
01:17:49 -  in those camps where your skin becomes blackened and parched and you can't eat and you're alone in your destitution where he says in verse 11 my days are like a shadow that declines and i'm with withered like grass but thou oh lord here's where the whole poem shifts and changes
01:18:11 -  that even in his broken and destitute condition there's some kind of a faith of hope that rises in God at the most abject time when there's least occasion to believe for it but thou oh lord shall endure forever i'm i'm i'm turning to dust i'm i'm decaying i write my body is wasting away i'm
01:18:33 -  nothing i've been stripped of everything but you oh lord shall endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shalt arise i always love these the word arise suggestive of the great theme of resurrection and have mercy upon zion for the whole issue of God at the end of the age with
01:18:55 -  Israel is the revelation of this mercy where he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy which means totally undeserved attention and grace from God for the time to favor her yay the set time has come now here's the here's the key point what makes it the set time that releases God to
01:19:15 -  express mercy to jews in a destitute concentration camp condition in which they are without any hope of anything but death it's because your servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof unlimited volumes could be written in commentary on this one verse it's cryptic it's
01:19:40 -  poetic it's it's laden with meaning but it has to be drawn out but here's the point to give you a help in drawing it out it's not Israel itself who affects the point at which time God will favor zion the destitution depravity unto death is not the turning point the set time comes because not
01:20:04 -  of what is revealed in Israel's condition but is revealed through his service which is the church it's a mystical reference to the church because the word church could not be employed by the psalmist writing this thousands of years before christ but when my when my servants shall
01:20:26 -  have pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof because it'll be reduced to us thus Israel is going to experience devastation the great cities and rising towers of tel aviv will come down it will all crumble the whole thing will be a devastation a place without habit without
01:20:50 -  habitation the land has become it says in isaiah our destruction it will be dust but what is our attitude when Israel will have failed our expectancy when we had hoped it would have been this Israel that would have restored the glory of God that this Israel would have been to fulfill
01:21:10 -  with the prophetic expectation and we had all along sought for it then we made trips and we planted trees and we made contributions and we prayed against arafat and all those kinds of things and in the end despite all that it comes down and it comes down and so abject and terrible away
01:21:27 -  that the world gloats at it and rubs its hand with glee and what has fallen upon this proud arrogant people but the servants of God take another attitude completely they find favor in the stones they're identified with the judgment that's what that means it's not the stones per se this
01:21:48 -  this is not antiquarian this is not archaeological this is symbolic the stones if they can if you can identify with the stones what then is your identification with the people who once were housed in those stones see what i mean if they found favor because it was the stones of Israel
01:22:09 -  because in identification with this with this people all the more of such a kind that has caught the attention of God it is so unrealistic to expect it now while all the world is gloating at Israel's collapse because you can you can understand Israel will become increasingly
01:22:28 -  arrogant in defying the world in its own necessity to preserve itself that's already an accusation why can't they be more accommodating why can't they agree to these terms what this okay so they're making some concession they've taken out a few watchtowers from the some of the
01:22:43 -  settlements but will they uproot the settlements themselves and will they do this in order to obtain that or will they insist no this is our land and it's our right and you guys have got to i believe Israel become increasingly intractable they must because their confidence in being
01:23:01 -  bailed out by the united states or certainly not the united nations can ever be a true confidence they will have to depend upon themselves and in doing so they'll make themselves less attractive in the world more objectionable more difficult more jewish more stubborn more stiff neck more
01:23:18 -  recalcitrant so that by the time of their devastation the world has that has had enough of them and have been threatened by the lack of peace that issues out of the middle east crisis will enjoy their plight but what is the set time to favor zion when my servants have found favor
01:23:37 -  in her stones and pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof you may have it expressed differently in your bible it's the issue of identification yes for the issue of identification is the issue of intercession it's the issue of coming into their tent suffering their shame
01:23:58 -  their identification and in fact if they're going to be pursued worldwide if the time will come when jews will be as hated globally as they were hated in europe and sought out and found that if you had so much as one great grandfather 164th jewish blood you're a candidate for the
01:24:16 -  ovens if that same kind of anti-christ demonic hatred of the jew will now have full expression globally what will be the fate of those christians who will identify with them not just in their minds but with their bodies their identification will be an act every bit as much as it was the act
01:24:39 -  of shem for his father coming in so ham comes out and tells gives the report to the two brothers our father is in drunken condition naked what they do with that report is the key to the whole of the of the future instead of just commiserating or feeling sorry waiting for the guy to sober up
01:25:04 -  or even joining canin and ham and their delight over the father's condition they come into the condition empathy pathos identification mutuality the the servants are gentiles but they are one with God and identification with the fallen people this is beyond sentiment
01:25:26 -  yes what shen had for his father was beyond sentiment even beyond filial obligation it was his identification with God the father the heart of the father that cannot bear to allow one's father to suffer a humiliation and shame and lay uncovered in his own tent that's the kind of thing
01:25:46 -  that will end the history as it began the history the commencement of shen has its conclusion with the church being to Israel with the son shim was his father and the ironic thing is that i need to find that identification myself being born a jew does not automatically fit me to be a jew with
01:26:04 -  the jews i could be superior even in my jewishness over and against my own people so it's not a racial ethnic thing it's a spiritual thing it's the shim thing and it's the thing to which we're called and to which we're moving so we bless you lord what a remarkable mystery what a majestic conclusion
01:26:25 -  to the age and that your servants isn't it remarkable talking about servants find favor in her stones and empathy compassion with her dust thank you precious God and when you see that the set time has come you will arise and deliver Israel from that predicament for nothing else
01:26:48 -  will suffice nothing that man or religion can perform certainly that a jew can perform in his turkish condition or any condition but only that you can perform when the set time has come you will arise let it come soon lord we pray and let it come if it's not too shameful or boasting
01:27:05 -  all the more in degree and proportion because of these days that we're enjoying together that what is being spoken what is being reviewed here and considered here will not fall to the ground it will not just be an enjoyment for those from you've gathered it will find its way in to
01:27:20 -  the body those who have no present consciousness than you at all and in fact have lingering anti-semitic dispositions will be met by this word and it will set in motion that preparation for such a people such a servant people for which you wait thank you lord that we're privileged to
01:27:35 -  be participants in this come out of a sick bed and and and sit down and and you unfold this remarkable thing and in fact it seems like a sick bed and a weakness would be a necessary requirement for the unfolding and the bringing forth of it and not any man's expertise or
01:27:54 -  vain strength so we bless you that even in the communication of the mystery the mystery itself is being propounded and enacted right before our eyes and that is what a prophetical school is that's what propheticism itself is that's what to be prophetic is and so we thank you lord for
01:28:17 -  the event we bow if you don't give us another word if i have to go back to the hospital today and we take another turn and the school is dismissed or it's not what we had hoped to have in full we would say we have received full measure thank you lord precious what you've
01:28:35 -  given us is precious beyond all speaking we almost have to imagine we're growing up in the hearing of this somehow there's a maturity that comes in the very hearing it compels us to rise up with such a word and we thank you lord what a history what a destiny what a call
01:28:55 -  is the church of Jesus christ of the last days toward this people and it will take millennia to rejoice and to celebrate the majesty of this so great wisdom and will that will be perfected and established because you have said thank you lord so receive our gratitude
01:29:17 -  continue to keep us my God in the environment the atmosphere which you have established by your own presence the high seriousness of God and that even though we take a break and walk about it'll not be lost and we'll come back with my gun as readily as we have left it so bless us together
01:29:35 -  bring a conclusion to this morning's time and seal it we thank you give you praise for the privilege of it in Jesus name amen
