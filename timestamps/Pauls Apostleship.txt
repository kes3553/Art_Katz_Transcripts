Pauls Apostleship

00:00 -  Lord, give us out of your divine wisdom and heart of intention and will what you have purposed for this morning. We don't care how foolish it may appear to us, how illogical we would have thought something
00:15 -  else. Whatever, Lord, you have intended, whatever is your purpose, you alone are the high priest and the apostle of our confession.
00:25 -  How dare any man presume to think that in and of himself he can lay such foundations and restore such paths to walk in? Come my God and possess this piece of dust and bring forth the thing that you have elected
00:41 -  and chosen that is to be inserted now in this once and for all time because you're the God who is with us continually. Not in fits and spurts, continually you guide us because you're a living God.
00:58 -  We're believing in you for that, Lord. We trust you. We look to you.
01:02 -  Come and have your satisfaction this morning. Be delighted, Lord, in the fulfillment of your will. We thank you and praise you for whatever that will is, for we delight to do your will.
01:13 -  We delight to hear your will. We receive it, my God, with gratitude, privilege, beyond all speaking, to have this eschatological preview of the end of the age set before us in these days in Jesus' name.
01:30 -  Amen. Let's turn to Ephesians and catch a sense of the Pauline grandeur, the apostle, the chief apostle, and his mind, his view, his perception of reality, the way he expresses himself,
01:52 -  where these are our foundations. Ephesians is one of the grandest expressions where Paul gives us a glimpse into himself as the chief apostle in chapter three of Ephesians, of course throughout the whole book, but here
02:11 -  For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles, can you imagine a Jew talking like that, a pharisaical Jew who has grown up with contempt and disdain for the goyim?
02:28 -  What's the goyim of? That's the Hebrew word for Gentiles. It means the nations, but it's spoken with derision and contempt by superior Jews who
02:41 -  think themselves morally and ethically above the goyim. You need to understand the wonder of Paul. Out of the deepest pharisaical traditions of self-exaltation and spiritual superiority,
02:59 -  according to the law, perfect and zeal outstanding, exceeding all of his brethren, that he is now a prisoner of the Lord for you Gentiles. The nations that were formerly despised as being inferior are now the subject of the
03:19 -  love and the attention of a man who has been completely transformed by being apprehended on the road to Damascus. He has received a revelation in which he himself could say with Isaiah,
03:37 -  Oh, it's me, I'm undone. My self-righteous pharisaical zeal has culminated in making me a persecutor of God himself. So the depth of the conversion that came through that revelation left Paul blind.
03:56 -  For three days he neither ate nor drank, nor did he see, except through the inward eye, his whole pharisaical Jewish life going before him. Because in the blinding light of the revelation of the resurrected Christ, it obliterated
04:13 -  what had thought to be light, and he was in a virtual darkness until the hands of an ordinary believer were laid upon him that he might receive his sight. I think I'll be speaking about this again before we conclude the conversion of Paul,
04:30 -  because his conversion is not just an incidental matter, it is foundational to his whole apostolic career. How he was saved in the depth of the revelation that came to him that required a blindness before it was relieved by the laying on of the hands of an ordinary obedient believer
04:57 -  will affect all of the subsequent life, thought, and consideration of the apostle. His conversion is our foundation. I've never before said that, I'm saying it now.
05:12 -  Therefore, his conversion is of particular significance, because it will affect his whole way in which he views God, man, sin, atonement, reality, the purposes of God, the genius of the church, the two being made one.
05:35 -  That he received his sight not exclusively and independently, but through the necessity of the hands being laid upon him by an ordinary believer inducted Paul from the very commencement of his apostolic life into the recognition of the genius of the body of Christ.
05:56 -  A man who was autonomous in his own independent brilliance now learns from the beginning, There's no continuation in God except independent relationship upon other members of the body with whom I am joined and have formally persecuted in my ignorance.
06:17 -  So Paul deserves to be studied. I don't know who I will more anxiously wait to meet in heaven of all of the great luminaries of the faith, including Isaiah, the patriarchs, than to meet Paul.
06:32 -  I love this man with such a love, I can't say what an esteem I have, because he is the very continuation of Christ. It's not I will guide you continually, I will be your life continually, I will be the thought
06:50 -  of your thought and the speaking of your speaking that you will be able to say for me to live as Christ. That whatever the Lord did not conclude in his own earthly tenure, he gave to Paul to
07:00 -  express. That's why Paul says, I give you this by commandment, for this is only an opinion, but what was his opinion is today for us as commandment, because Paul was so expressly the mind and
07:18 -  will and thought of the life of the resurrected Christ. He was the man of the resurrection. That's why he could be sent to Athens, the capital of the world and its unGodly wisdom
07:35 -  in the view of all of its great temples, where I have been a number of times on Mars Hill, standing on the stone upon which Paul is supposed to have spoken, made smooth and slippery by the feet of countless pilgrims who have come up to Athens to be on the spot where Paul
07:53 -  spoke, Acts 17. Now when you see that place, you see the ruins of the temples which in Paul's time were resplendent and unharmed.
08:06 -  He stood in the very view of the glory of Greece, and he confronted men with the foolishness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I wanted to hear what this babbler will say, who said, God has winked in times past, but
08:23 -  he now commands all men everywhere to repent, for he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world by that man whom he has raised from the dead. Paul was wise to know that nothing is more offensive to the Greek secular rational mind
08:44 -  than the impossibility of resurrection from the dead. He spoke the one thing calculated to inflame and to antagonize Greek philosophical rational understanding.
08:58 -  He chose the point of deepest offense to be the foundation of a message in which he says, God will judge the world by that man whom he has raised from the dead, even giving the reason for which God has of one blood made all nations of men and established the bounds
09:18 -  of their habitations, so that they might seek God and be found of him. That's not a message only for personal conversion. That's a message to the nations that don't think that your geographic location is your
09:36 -  playground, that the piece of earth that you occupy, by whatever name you gave it, is yours for commercial, industrial, military, or other reasons. The earth is the Lord's and the nations and those that dwell therein.
09:53 -  He's a God of purpose and he's established a number of the nations according to the number of the sons of Israel. There's a cosmic design of God for the nations and Paul says, you're going to be held accountable
10:07 -  for not seeking him to find out the purpose for which your bounds and habitations were given, for God will judge the world by that man whom he has raised from the dead. And so many turned and turned away.
10:26 -  Some said we will hear again of this matter and never did, but some clave unto Paul and believed. On what basis could they believe in the judgment of God by a man whom he has raised from the
10:39 -  dead, contrary to all Greek philosophical and rational thought? Because Paul himself was the statement of the resurrection from the dead. Paul himself was the man of the resurrection and his whole address was a resurrection statement
11:02 -  because it did not come out of a school of evangelism. It came out of the life of God as he stood in a place where he was brought by other men and had no time to prepare and began his address with an insult.
11:16 -  I perceive in all things that you're too superstitious because I passed by your monuments to the unknown God. I saw that you're playing a game.
11:26 -  You like to keep him unknown, but him I will declare unto you. Such boldness, such insult, calculated not to win an audience but to lose it because his statement from beginning to end was a resurrection statement.
11:40 -  It was not meditated out of his Jewish brain box. It came out of the life of God who addressed those men in a once and for all time that shall not be given again.
11:51 -  And some clave unto him and believed, for he was the veritable evidence of the reality and truth of resurrection as the thing in himself. So do you love Paul?
12:06 -  To love Paul is to love Christ, is to celebrate the resurrection, is to see that what was necessary for Paul as the foundational apostle is the necessity for us to live and build on that foundation and to continue in that apostolic glory by the same power by which
12:29 -  he himself explicated and established it. Are you the sons and daughters of the resurrection or is it just the doctrine to which you give ascent?
12:41 -  What is the question for you? Are you the sons and daughters of the resurrection who can say with Paul for me to live as Christ or is it only a doctrine to which you have given ascent and agreement?
12:57 -  We will not fulfill our mandate to the Jew and the things that are encumbered upon us as the church of the last days except as being sons and daughters of the resurrection. And we might say with Paul in truth for us to live as Christ.
13:18 -  If that's not true for me now, saints, I deserve to be taken from this platform where in myself I have nothing to say or to exhibit. For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles, a bond slave for
13:36 -  the people whom he formerly despised and now he broods over as a father in the faith, as a mother, as a nursemaid that Christ might be formed in them. You understand the miracle?
13:51 -  You understand the antagonism between Jews and Gentiles? You need to understand it. How historic, how deep, the enmity.
14:01 -  I'm living with it for 42 years. It's instinctive, but with my wife who's a Gentile, she likes to put pictures on walls and celebrate birthdays and Christmas trees and all those goyish, Gentile things that make me cringe.
14:20 -  And she's living with a strange phenomenon. This Hebrew man, this man of the tent and the altar, he's single-eyed, he doesn't have natural affection for his own kin, he's a bond slave.
14:37 -  She wants a house with a white fence and a man who's here home from nine to five away, not this guy who's skipping all over the world and strange. Listen, you guys, you need to understand or you'll fall short of the appreciation of the
14:54 -  glory of the reconciliation that God intends between Jews and Gentiles. There's an instinctive antipathy on the part of unsaved Jews. They may be polite, they may show themselves cordial, but don't speak the gospel, don't
15:15 -  mention the name or the face, the mask of civility comes off and they will bear their teeth at you. Paul says rightly in Romans 11, they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake.
15:30 -  You ever read that? We Jews are the authors of Marxism. Karl Marx was a Jew.
15:38 -  Sigmund Freud was a Jew who has laid the basis of modern understanding of man and mind. The principle movements by which the modern world is established has Jewish roots. We Jews are influential, short, small in number, but significant in impact.
16:00 -  And the antagonism between us and the Gentiles is historic and deep. The most recent tragedy of which is the Holocaust, the systematic annihilation of 6 million Jews. I had to debate whether to include another book in my suitcase that had come to me recently
16:21 -  of the history of a certain mission to the Jews of Europe in which there's the most explicit account of the barbaric pogroms, which is a Polish word for massacre, that took place in the Ukraine and in Russia in 1902, 1903, in the 1920s, where Jews could not even bury
16:44 -  their dead. Dogs and pigs ate from them as their bodies were strewn out over the streets because to try and even save a body meant your own death sentence.
16:55 -  They were bludgeoned, they were beaten, they were speared, they were buried alive, their children were killed, the pregnant women had their bellies sliced open. It was a horror of massacre and only one of many that have spotted the history of Jews
17:14 -  in Europe and the world throughout the ages at the hands of Gentiles and in their understanding the hands of Christians. My mother could never understand how I could ever go to Germany or set foot in a Volkswagen
17:30 -  because for her the Holocaust was not a German crime, it was a Christian crime. And in fact Jewish scholars today explain the Holocaust as the failure of the church and that the root and seed of anti-Jewish hatred is to be found in the New Testament itself.
17:54 -  In the reference to the Jews. This is deep, dear saints, and I didn't bring the book so I'm just giving you an impromptu lesson but you need to search it out.
18:06 -  Why? Not only because it's tragic but that God will one day overcome this antagonism and bring about such a reconciliation between people whose nature and histories are so opposed
18:22 -  that they will become one for the glory of God even as he is one. So Paul as a prisoner of Christ for the Gentiles is already the genius of God's redemptive glory and the reconciliation of all mankind.
18:42 -  So that when Paul later in Acts chapter 20 calls for the elders of Ephesus where we're now reading to say goodbye and they came and they met with him and they didn't hop on the nearest airplane they came on foot or on the back of a donkey in grueling heat because Paul called they came.
19:05 -  They didn't need an explanation if Paul called they came and then he said to them you'll see my face no more you know what manner of man I was with you from the first day and night in tears from house to house and in public places sharing with you the whole
19:24 -  counsel of God I didn't spare you I didn't just give you the good parts I told you of the intrinsic suffering that comes with obedience to the faith and I myself was a picture of that suffering as you saw my scars and so they knelt down and prayed and when he said you'll see my
19:41 -  face no more they hung upon his neck and wept is there ever a more beautiful scene than Gentile men weeping over a Jew who did not come to them with his Jewish prejudice with his pharisaical superiority he came as a broken slave who had poured out his life for their
20:05 -  sake this is a picture saints of a future in which then they Paul says I'm a man born out of time what you see in me is a preview of our entire nation as I was a rebel and an antagonist of God and of Christ and a persecutor
20:28 -  as they are today they too will have their their road to Damascus experience they shall see him whom they have pierced and mourn for him and be restored and they will be a well-watered garden God will give them his spirit and a new covenant they will fulfill their destiny and calling
20:45 -  because if they don't fulfill it how is God God how is he the keeper of covenant how is he the keeper of his word and his promise who said gave them a call you shall be unto me and a nation of priests and a light unto the world if we shall not be there
21:01 -  don't you understand the issue of Israel is the issue of God of which Paul says I'm born before the time what you see in me is a preview of the entire nation that has itself an apostolate an apostolic calling to the nations
21:24 -  and you're getting a little preview and a taste in these very days I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ from the Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me toward you how that by revelation he made known unto me the
21:42 -  mystery as I wrote before in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ this is one of Paul's favorite words mystery it's at the heart of apostolic understanding that there are mysteries of God secret hidden things that are revealed in
22:07 -  point of time to holy men of which Paul is the guardian and the steward of the mysteries of God so I don't know about your Chinese mentality and disposition is there a place for mystery or is everything systematic mechanical arithmetical rational you need to develop
22:34 -  a sense for mystery the things that are hidden and concealed that need to be revealed and they'll be revealed to those who respect mystery and have a disposition to esteem and wait for the revelation thereof if you lack that component you're not fit to be sent
23:00 -  there's got to be in you a disposition for the yet unrevealed mysteries of God and to the degree that they are given to you as revelation their guardianship and the stewardship of the mystery that you don't spew it out on any occasion to show how clever you are
23:21 -  but on those occasions when God will open your mouth to speak it with the reverence and devotion and attention it deserves in being communicated my glad this is on tape that the attitude toward mystery and a disposition to be a steward and a
23:41 -  guardian over the sacredness of it and to communicate it not at your will but at his will by the grace that is given as being a well-warded guardian is a component of the apostolic and prophetic personality I've never before said it like that don't panic if you're not getting
24:07 -  everything in the moment that it's being spoken because we are praying that with the speaking comes a spirit of understanding that goes into your spirit with the word and will later on rise to the level of consciousness and understanding but is being implanted with the word so if your
24:32 -  brain doesn't immediately get it don't feel guilty don't panic don't shut off the flow open and receive and later on it will come to clarity and to understanding even as my brother said last night that when he heard things from me what it was was the articulation of what has already long
24:55 -  been given him in his inner man and now brought to consciousness by the prophetic word that has come this is a remarkable phenomenon so we're on the other ground now we're not on rational worldly ground we're on heavenly ground in the realm of communication by spirit
25:17 -  so I'm speaking like the fool I'm going all over the landscape already this morning when I got up at four in the morning I thought Lord I don't even know how to continue you but the Lord will guide you continually
25:34 -  okay so you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
25:52 -  is that juicy and there's a word for juicy in the Jewish language the same word as in German is that is that juicy did you hear that what a statement it drips it drips with juice we dare not read it too hurriedly
26:12 -  the that was not known before is made known now unto the sons of men and is now revealed revealed means that it's the initiative of God and not the cleverness of men that has come and to whom is it revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit
26:38 -  I think the Italians say mamma mia that's loaded what a statement revealed not just to apostles and prophets holy apostles and prophets for how shall the sacred things of God be revealed and be given to men who are not holy and how is a man an apostle or a
27:01 -  prophet if he's not holy is Paul drawing attention to his spirituality is he celebrating something in himself knowing that he's speaking of himself as a holy apostle to whom such mysteries are revealed he's showing us the the nip the composition of the genius by which the mysteries
27:24 -  of God are made known to men ever and always in any generation including and especially the last if there's to be any understanding it will come by being revealed not by by our brain exercise but what is given revealed by the initiative of God as it is given
27:44 -  exclusively to holy men who are apostles and prophets that's one way you can tell the phonies from the real to what degree do they have any command or knowledge or communication of the mysteries of God if they speak of Israel they speak of it in the most limited
28:06 -  mechanical and evangelical way praying for the peace of Jerusalem they know nothing more they are not articles they have nothing to communicate because nothing has been revealed because they're not holy and receiving by the Holy Spirit the mysteries of God
28:26 -  we need to have such a reverence for that with that which is truly apostolic and prophetic for it's through these men alone by the spirit that God reveals the sacred mysteries that are the keys of understanding and service in these last days
28:49 -  unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit Paul is the man of the spirit and the recipient of those mysteries and makes them known by the spirit what's the mystery that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in
29:12 -  Christ by the gospel you do not realize you have not yet sufficiently appreciated that you who were far off and without God and hope in the world have been brought nigh by the blood of Israel's Messiah into the promises and covenants and hopes into the commonwealth of Israel itself
29:43 -  to be made one body with that people my first time in Singapore I forgot what church it was 700 Chinese Christians singing the praises of the God of Israel it was a moving experience I was overwhelmed to see orientals celebrating Israel's
30:11 -  God and giving visible evidence of salvation and to see the plaques on the walls of the church of the missionaries who had come in 1903 and 1906 who died of malaria or died of this or died of that to communicate the message by which now 700 Chinese believers are singing praises of Israel's
30:35 -  God this is an astonishment you saints you were out nowhere you without God without hope you have come into another tree you were wild branches and fruitless until you were grafted in their place have you appreciated that
30:56 -  you celebrate the God whose mercy is so great that it was so staggering an innovation that the that the Messiah that had come for Israel is also intended as a grace for Gentiles that Paul Peter needed a trance in order to be to come into the house of a Gentile even speak that he had to see
31:19 -  the house of a Gentile even speak that he had to see a sheet with unclean animals and God commanding him to slay and eat he said Lord I've never eaten an unclean thing I'm an Orthodox Jew I'll never go into the house of the uncircumcised they're unclean
31:35 -  they fornicate like rabbits and they drink and they live to excess they're only on the sensual realm and level they're materialistic they're mindless they have no knowledge of God I'll never be corrupted and defiled by coming into such a house God says take and eat and call not what
31:52 -  I have made clean unclean and at that moment there's a knock on the door and the emissaries from the Cornelius are asking Peter to come and speak in their house and as he speaks the Holy Ghost falls on Gentiles and he's staggered by the fact that they have received the promise
32:12 -  intended for us that the salvation for which we have awaited is now being extended also to non-Jews this is a mystery it's the first mystery that Paul mentions but it's never occurred to you as being a mystery you've taken your faith for granted you thought that Christianity was always the
32:31 -  ever-present reality you have not sufficiently understood nor appreciated the mystery in which you yourself have been inducted and are expressing therefore you're falling short of the apostolic and prophetic glory therefore your faith has become a commonplace
32:53 -  therefore Chinese are known as rice Christians who wanted to embrace another western culture as a means of elevation you have not sufficiently regarded the mystery that has come to you who are far off and without God and hope in the world and therefore when the Jews come to you
33:17 -  you'll not be to them what you want but if you see yourself as the recipient of their salvation for salvation is of the Jews you'll regard them differently you'll express yourself differently there'll be something in your face there'll be something in your spirit there'll be a kindness
33:40 -  of another kind that is more than just being cordial you'll be expressing the deep gratitude that you have received from them that even in their unbelief and apostasy have given us the scriptures and the prophets and the apostles and by which means the salvation that is exclusively
33:57 -  for the Jews has come to you also in fact they'll see in something in you that transcends Chinese they're going to see something in you that could be better be described as hebraic something of the mystery has come into you because you have been consciously grafted in
34:16 -  gratefully grafted in and you're exhibiting that gratitude and the fruit of it for the sap of the roof flows through you and you're celebrating Israel's God you're the lover of the Psalms and of the prophets and there's a quotient and a dimension of the whole hebraic ancestry and
34:37 -  heritage that has come into you that transcends both race and culture and brings in the fullness of the Gentiles for which God is waiting that when they see your face they see something beyond and through that touches them in their deeps because in the most profound sense you are
34:59 -  more Jewish than they are I'm not talking about something cultural you're more hebraic than they are even the way you deport yourself the way you bear yourself the way you express yourself is a resonance of Israel's God the Jews who are yet outside who are now presently far
35:21 -  often without God that's why in Ezekiel 20 God says to the Jews I will meet with you in the wilderness of the nations face to face and there you will come under the bond of my covenant and under the rod of my authority I'm way ahead of myself now and something that should be spoken
35:43 -  later this week but right now I want to say we are on a course a collision course to meet with the lost sheep of the house of Israel in our nations where they will be uprooted and expelled and sifted through all nations in order that thereby they may encounter God
36:09 -  in places where they would never have expected to find him in Africa with black faces and in the orient with Chinese faces through whom something luminous and transcendent is exhibited beyond race and culture it's the fullness into which the Gentiles have come
36:31 -  through the salvation that has been made theirs by being grafted in to another tree and you'll not exhibit that or express that unless you're conscious of that mystery and are recipients of that miracle with gratitude and daily and continuous appreciation
36:52 -  for the sap that flows from that exclusive tree is now the source of your life and behavior that the Gentile should be fellow heirs with whom with the redeemed of Israel and of the same body the body of Christ is not a new testament innovation is the continuation of the true
37:13 -  faith carried by those who did not reject Jesus and to whom the earliest Gentile believers were joined in one body so we mustn't think that our Christianity is an innovation and independent of its roots it's utterly hebraic utterly biblical utterly continuous it's the
37:38 -  unbroken redemptive glory that was given from the first and carried through all the generations and has now been made available to the Gentiles through the gospel welcome to the faith of Israel whereof in verse 7 I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God
37:57 -  given unto me by the effectual workings of his power unto me here's a heart of the matter who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery
38:17 -  which from the beginning of the world have been hidden God who created all things by Jesus Christ we do err if we read too quickly too hurriedly and too superficially such grand things as are being set before us here word by word and line by line the book of Ephesians is so grand
38:42 -  so eloquent so deep that we skip it as if it's some kind of flourish some kind of biblical sleight of hand we don't wait we don't ponder we don't reflect the content the remarkable statements that are being made that we want to do now so much as grace will be given that the
39:06 -  revelation of what Paul is seeing and the communicating is given to him who is less than the least of all saints is this grace given is this some false modesty is this some kind of political play on words does Paul really mean he's he sees himself as the less less than the
39:31 -  least of all saints now presently as an apostle and the chief apostle he now sees himself as now the less than the least of all saints and my answer is yes this is not false modesty this is not salesman's modesty this is not that selfie-facing oriental way in which
39:52 -  culture has taught us to be respectful this is the deepest humility of God that required the man to be a persecutor and a murderer until the grace of God came through revelation and the power of God to save him and to change him but he sees himself still
40:10 -  in his humanity as less than the least of all men has this grace somehow in view of his becoming the chief apostle it required the necessary preparation of being a persecutor and a murderer he had to see what he was as a man I'm undone for I am a man and until the man recognizes
40:40 -  the essential depravity of himself as man he's not fit to be sent he's not fit to be an apostle until he carries with him the remembrance of the essential condition out of which he has been saved and which yet lingers but by the grace of God as a man less than the least of all saints
41:02 -  this is a component this is not false modesty this is not selfie-facing uh pseudo humility this is deeply grounded recognition that there but the grace of God go I and this is foundational to the foundational man and it will be foundational to the nation Israel
41:26 -  now hear this if Paul had always to carry with him the consciousness of being less than the least of all saints in order that the grace might be given what shall Israel carry that is to become a nation of priests and a light unto the world that it should not again rise to a place of
41:48 -  pharisaical and spiritual superiority over the nations but come in the humility of Christ to be a servant to the goya it will have to carry the same knowledge that as a nation we are less than the least of all saints because we have for thousands of years been an apostasy because
42:11 -  we have stoned the prophets that were sent unto us because we have crucified the holy one of Israel himself and persecuted God and his church so that when we shall see him whom we have pierced we shall mourn every family apart every husband and wife apart because the depth of their mourning
42:34 -  and their contrition will be so profound they cannot express it in the presence of another human being even their own wife or their own husband it will be the deepest national repentance that the world has ever seen and it will not fade when they get up from their faces days later
42:53 -  it will remain in their deep in their collective consciousness it will always be an aspect that they will carry as a nation of priests and not into the world that they are less than the least of all saints to whom the grace is given because they have come into their apostolate
43:13 -  to the nations and must conduct it and express it in the same humility as Paul himself what then is our obligation what then should be a component of our apostolic and prophetic being if not exactly the same kind of consciousness and the same kind of humility how shall we witness to them
43:36 -  unless we come to them in the same thing to which they themselves are called are we a witness unto him and is that not why God says to the jew first and also to the greek that our first witness is to this antagonistic people who are the enemies of the gospel for
43:54 -  our sake that we don't just come to them with are you saved brother you know christ we don't lay a trip on them we don't make them feel guilty we don't make them feel stupid we come to them in our own brokenness as ourselves coming out of the depths of God rejection
44:17 -  and the recipients of the same grace that is now being offered them we've got to come to them in a genuine meekness and humility which is of christ because we see ourselves truly as being less than the least of all saints you can't learn this you can't make
44:34 -  this a matter of principle it needs to be imparted and given in union with the God whose essential nature is meekness learn of me for i am lowly and meek this is an apostolic and prophetic requirement i'll tell you something ironic the more to which you have been apprehended
45:02 -  and have come into this essential disposition which is God's the more you will be accused of exactly the opposite by unseeing men and carnal mindless christians you'll be accused of arrogance you'll be accused of conceit you'll be accused of lovelessness the irony is
45:26 -  that your humility will be misconstrued and misunderstood because your humility may require the overthrow of the money changes tables and that will appear to men who do not perceive rightly arrogance and conceit because of your obedience in humility to speak the thing of God that will
45:48 -  God that will offend men it will be attributed to your own initiative as being arrogant and conceited and who's told you that you should speak like that and how dare you wish i had the proverbial dollar every time i have been accused of that arrogance of that conceit of
46:12 -  that presumption in the very moment of the most submitted meekness and humility to the will of God that offends men this meekness and humility is not given us for salesmanship this is God's essential character and nature and Paul has it to the degree that he's in union with that God
46:36 -  because the irony is there's no other way to attain this essential disposition you can't learn it and obtain it as principle or study to to show yourself meek it's intrinsic it's the essential character of God and you have it in the same measure as you have him or he has you and until
47:01 -  you have that you're not going to be sent or who shall go for us whom shall we send who shall go for us who is not only going to bear the words that need to be carried into their generation which is not their own but ours but also exhibit the nature and the
47:23 -  character of the God who sends them whose single most distinguishing characteristic is his essential meekness and humility learn of me for I am lowly and meek I'm not putting on an act this is what I am in myself this is my essential nature as God therefore I stand at the door
47:47 -  and knock I don't knock the door down I knock if any man hear my voice and open to me I will come and sup with it you'll find two asses in the neighboring village you'll find the the ass and its cult bring them to me if any man stops you and says what are you doing tell them the
48:09 -  Lord has need of them and sure enough they found these two animals the mother the ass and her cult upon which never man sat and Jesus does not take the mature animal and come down the precipitous mount of olives on the back of a feast already fitted to bear the burden of a man he sits upon
48:31 -  the ass the cult of the ass upon which never man sat and comes lurching down that they will walk down the mount of olives it's steep you can't even walk and maintain your dignity but to come down on the back of a cult that that has never before borne the weight of a man that staggers
48:52 -  in his lopsided and foolish and ridiculous and absurd and an object of derision and laughter and contempt that's how the king came triumphantly into his zip your king shall come to you lowly and meek and if the king comes lowly and meek how shall the kingdom come so I appreciate
49:11 -  the humility of Paul who confronted Peter to his face for he would not for a moment allow the truth of the gospel to suffer loss and he did it before others and Peter was in the faith before him and was recognized as the rock and what would men say who is this upstart
49:35 -  Paul contradicting Peter openly and publicly what is he jealous for his position and trying to impugn him so that he can be celebrated in his place that's how men will think and Paul knew that he would be misconstrued they would not understand his motive they would
49:57 -  attribute it out of their own thinking to some desire for personal elevation at Peter's expense but he did not for a moment hesitate to confront him to his face before all because he was meek he surrendered to the will of God in the immediate moment without any thought
50:19 -  of the consequence for himself or how he would be perceived or understood you just need to take an airplane flight these days and see what they put on the movies before you little glimpses of the Hollywood stars and their great occasions and they're dressed in the latest most revealing gowns
50:38 -  and they're being interviewed I don't even listen I just watch the lips move and I watch the faces and the pride and talking about their careers as if it's the most earnest matter in the world and how they were discovered and how they began as minor starlets and how they have now reached these
50:57 -  places of eminence and celebration and the candidates for academy awards and their beauties and their ravishing and you hate the world as I do you despise its vanity its sickly pride its sharpness foolishness thinking what would these women be another 10 20 30 years when they're
51:20 -  when their beauty fades having breast transplants and every kind of thing to make them seductive and attractive shallow nothings whose lives are echoes of emptiness and the world runs after that as celebrities we have our Paul we have the prophets we have the patriarchs we have the
51:47 -  God of Israel so unto me who am not who was at least less than the least of all saints but who am now presently less than the least how how can you know yourself to be the chief apostle to whom is given the oversight of the great mysteries of God and its proclamation in the
52:12 -  laying the foundation for generations to come by what he is and does and says and at the same time see himself as being presently less than the least of all saints this is paradox this is contradiction but it's at the heart and the genius of what is apostolic not only for Paul but for us
52:32 -  pray for that lord I'm so removed I don't see myself in that way in fact I see myself as being even heads and shoulders with the best of your saints I compare myself with others but I don't see myself as you would have me to see me less than the least lord save me from a false
52:55 -  modesty save me from affecting a certain outward and superficial exhibition bring me my God to the authentic thing which is of yourself your own essential nature and I know that the only way I'll obtain it is not magically but through union through the frequency of my times of devotion
53:19 -  with you in the early morning hours at 4 a.m and it's seeking your face and bowing before you on cold floors and calling upon you in the foolishness of such hours that something is communicated from me but toward me by which some semblance of yourself comes in in those consecration
53:41 -  consecrated devoted times that Christ is formed in me and as often as I take his body and his blood something is coming into me as often as I'm in his word so as often I'm in obedience something of that life is being formed in me and the essential character of that life is meekness
54:01 -  and humility it's the only way to obtain it saints communion with God and what he is in himself and we're not offered enough up early enough and seeking that communion and if we seek it with this conscious end it's no longer communion then it becomes commerce we're investing in giving
54:24 -  our time in order to obtain a certain end no communion is exclusive it has nothing to do with the benefit we receive though we receive benefit I have not yet come to the principal thing for this morning and I don't think I will come but all of this has been preparatory for when
54:42 -  it comes tomorrow or tonight but just to leave you with this tantalizing anti-climax verse eight that the less than least of all saints that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ riches of Christ even the word preach deserves a moment of reverent silence
55:05 -  do you revere preaching or is it just a technique of methodology a glib flow of words I can't bear to see the tv evangelists I can't bear to see the most popular public speakers I can't bear to hear them
55:26 -  they're glib they're they're they're wordy they know how to make unctuous remarks and quote scripture but there's not life in their proclamation preaching is more than a mechanic it's more than an art it's a mystery preaching is divine communication it pleased God through the
55:50 -  preaching of foolishness to save men preaching is a unique phenomenon it's not just the mere employment of speech it's a special divinely enhanced communication that washes the speaker even as the word goes forth they're washed in the water of the word
56:14 -  and made clean these things I have spoken unto you and you're clean Jesus said my word is spirit and life go and say to this people to the Isaiah who says here am I send me and in your saying your ears will be stopped their
56:34 -  hearts will be made heavy your understanding will be blocked that they cannot be saved your word will be for them judgment preaching is an ultimate phenomenon and who is sufficient for these things God forbid it ever becomes an issue of personal talent or ability or being handy with
56:58 -  words may we be speechless may we be may be stammered be stupefied and be unable to put two words together except God give the grace you need to see how the whole of the faith needs to rise in esteem and appreciation the conclusion of the age the redemption of Israel the fulfillment
57:20 -  of its destiny and called despite its own unwillingness and opposition to come into its own apostolate to the nations that they might be as awarded garden and continually have the counsel of God as they restore the past to walk in for the world the mystery of gentiles we brought
57:40 -  being brought into the faith of Israel's God the genius of what it means to be apostolic and holy in order to receive the ministries that they might be expressed not just to be informational but to be fulfilled the whole of the faith needs to come into a deeper apprehension and enhancement
58:03 -  or else it will sink into the commonplace into the trivial into the sentimental that by the spirit these mysteries are revealed and by the spirit are they expressed and by the spirit are they fulfilled so lord before we even see and consider the great statement of verse nine
58:29 -  of what is the fellowship of the mystery from the beginning of world that's been hidden God who created all things by Jesus christ before we consider that mystery we want to consider mystery itself we want to consider apostolic character meekness and humility why the king himself had
58:51 -  to come on the back of an ass upon which never man sat and be a picture of absurdity and foolish lurching and jerking down that hillside and calling that the triumphal entry of the king into the holy city hearing the shouts and the acclaims of the saints hosanna for the king has come
59:17 -  so lord let this morning be a tempering time you've sounded many things to affect our inward man to give us a disposition of another kind to open a new respect for the realm of mystery for the things that are revealed by the spirit
59:42 -  to men and women who are holy wash us by the water of the word of all superficiality of all shallow disregard for the faith that has settled upon us as everyday commonplace that even the word apostolic and prophetic has become just a new catch word wash us lord
01:00:09 -  of the casual air that prevails in our evangelical and charismatic generation in which the fear of God is unknown that we might receive some measure of the mystery of the things of which Paul was stewart not for our entertainment or our cleverness but for their
01:00:32 -  fulfillment so we bless you lord i've never seen you take such pains in such detail to speak so preliminary a measure of things before you bring the full weight of your statement but i'm appreciating it you're investing my God in the church of the last days of the nations
01:00:57 -  because you have brought a piece of redeemed Israel to restore the past to walk in and to rebuild the foundations that have been laid waste may this people appreciate the preview of the end of the age and labor to that end more ardently and effectually because of the privilege
01:01:19 -  of what has been given them in these days we thank and give you praise for this morning because you have continually guided us as a warded garden we thank you in Jesus name amen
