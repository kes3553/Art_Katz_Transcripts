The Destiny of Israel and the Nations 1 of 2

00:00 -  We have one occasion tonight, and I have been brooding over what is to be shared on this one occasion. There are many things that the Lord can express through me. I'm a privileged man with perspectives that are rare,
00:20 -  but the issue is what aspect does the Lord want communicated tonight in this once and for all occasion. So the faintest disposition that I have is to speak about Israel and the nations, Israel's theocratic place in the nations,
00:45 -  the issue of God's rule over his creation through a restored nation. Do you understand that already, and should I go on to some other subject? So let me pray. Lord, gracious God on high,
01:03 -  the Lord of this night and of this occasion who has given it and overcome every adverse circumstance to make it possible and to bring this servant into this nation. So Lord, we're jealous over this occasion as we know that you are,
01:22 -  and as I have prayed with my brothers before coming, that you'll not allow me, my God, in any way to trespass or to violate against your sovereignty merely because I have the ability to speak a number of good things,
01:40 -  but the issue is what is the perfect and appointed thing that you have ordained for this night and for this occasion to go into this church, into this body, into this community, into this nation that will affect all of their thought, all of their consideration, all of their future.
02:00 -  So Lord, you know the end from the beginning, come and so take possession of your servant, be the life of his life, the thought of his thought, the speaking of his speaking, and bring forth, my God, that perfect and appointed word from the throne of heaven.
02:17 -  We believe you for it. We know that you're able to communicate it and to give it. We thank you and give you the praise. Delight your soul, gratify your own heart, fulfill your own will. We thank you and give you praise. In Jesus' name, Amen.
02:35 -  Amen, amen, and amen. Well, I knew that tonight would be encyclopedic. It has to, by very nature, be a very broad and comprehensive statement.
02:51 -  So we have already prayed for you that you'll not be intimidated and you'll be able to hear and to receive the breadth of what God wants to communicate. How are we doing so far? Is my English okay?
03:06 -  My Brooklyn, New York English? Okay. Well, let's start in Isaiah, a remarkable statement in chapter 2 that the church has historically spiritualized and dismissed
03:26 -  as it has with so many of the literal statements in scripture about Israel's restoration and place of ultimate significance in the purposes of God, millennially and eternally.
03:44 -  Whether that's unbelief or some intrinsic disposition that does not want to believe such a destiny for Jews because they don't deserve it is a reflection of a mentality
04:02 -  that yet prevails in the church, in the world. That though we subscribe to grace, we break down when we view Israel's terrible track record and apostasy
04:18 -  and that God even acknowledges that they have blasphemed my name in all the nations to which I have driven them and in fact presently they are blaspheming his name in their own nation.
04:31 -  Yet despite that, that God would still have a place of distinction and honor for that nation above all nations and make it central to all nations is one of the most remarkable statements not about Israel
04:48 -  but about the nature of God himself in his grace. Are you following me so far? I'm just beginning.
05:00 -  The issue of Israel is the issue of God. The issue of Israel is the issue of the church. The issue of Israel is the issue of the nations.
05:12 -  Israel is central in the election of God for his oversight over his creation not because they deserve it, not because they are qualified by any particular Jewish brilliance but because he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy
05:35 -  and he will elect whom he will elect, he will choose whom he will choose. The issue of Israel is the issue of God in his choosing, in his mercy, in his grace independent of any lack of qualification
05:55 -  which of course is the truth equally of the church but we also don't appreciate the grace that has come to us except we can begin to see through the vista of God's grace toward Israel.
06:14 -  Chapter 2 of Isaiah, the word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem so here's a very specific and literal reference and context because there's going to be in this text a reference to the word Zion.
06:35 -  The law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem which the church historically has dismissed that the word Zion is a metaphor, a symbolic word, it refers to a spiritual condition
06:51 -  it does not mean a literal specific and geographic place especially found in Israel itself. Got the idea? In order to dismiss the literal meaning
07:05 -  the church has historically spiritualized these references and make it refer to some kind of airy general statement about a spiritual condition in which Zion could be understood to be the church
07:20 -  and in fact that's not a misuse of the word. Zion can refer to the church, the word Zion is emblematic and symbolic and can speak of a certain spiritual condition
07:36 -  but not at the cost of dismissing its first and literal intent. So I can say tonight that the issue of Israel is the issue of scripture it's the issue of interpretation
07:52 -  it's the issue of exegesis. How we read Israel in scripture is how we understand scripture and if men are presumptuous to say even though this is addressed specifically
08:08 -  from the very beginning to Judah and Jerusalem what God is really saying here does not refer to a literal place or a people it refers to a kind of a general condition
08:24 -  and by that kind of interpretation we have dismissed the word of God away and to dismiss the word of God is to dismiss God and if we will take that liberty with references to Israel
08:41 -  where will our liberty cease? So there's something that has robbed the church not only of its understanding of Israel's specific and literal future
08:56 -  but has degraded the way in which it has understood the word allowed itself presumption and arrogance and has fallen into the very trap about which Paul has warned
09:09 -  that I would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery brethren lest you become wise in your own conceit from where have I just quoted?
09:21 -  Romans chapter 11 Paul gives a specific warning that he gives in no other place that the loss of the mystery of Israel will necessarily bring
09:35 -  a certain kind of conceit, inflation into the church that will rob it of its messianic character and make it less and other than God intends it to be
09:51 -  that's why I say at the beginning the issue of Israel is the issue of the church but it's the issue of Israel rightly apprehended
10:02 -  you can miss it just as much by being sentimental and you can miss it by being cynical or indifferent or even anti-Semitic
10:15 -  let me just pause, take a breath how are we doing so far? cats to control tower over
10:22 -  how are we doing? are you following me? am I over your head?
10:28 -  is my English too fancy? is this too conceptual? are you getting too much in too short a time?
10:35 -  every one of these statements are, what shall I say? weighty but it's being recorded
10:44 -  you can hear it and ponder and reflect upon it again what am I saying? the church has historically worldwide paid a great price
10:56 -  in its dismissal of the literal and specific prophetic references to Israel's destiny it has dismissed it because it has no stomach to believe for such a destiny
11:12 -  it has an antipathy against the Jew and against Israel and doesn't think that they deserve such honor and distinction or they have not the faith to believe for it
11:27 -  or looking at the history of Israel and Israel's present condition they cannot see any prospect by which these remarkable scriptures can be fulfilled that's why the issue of Israel and the fulfillment of God's prophetic word
11:43 -  is the issue of God himself that's why we need to be jealous over that fulfillment so for example, excuse me, I told you this is going to be encyclopedic
11:59 -  in Romans 11 again Paul says what shall the return be with life from the dead? for when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in
12:10 -  so all Israel shall be saved as it is written the deliverer shall come out of Zion and take transgression from Jacob according to the covenant that I have made with them
12:26 -  and according to what is written Paul is saying that the issue of Israel and the fulfillment of God's prophetic word is the issue of God as God
12:40 -  that he can fulfill a covenant and what is written even despite the unwillingness of that people themselves for that fulfillment isn't this a remarkable paradox?
12:56 -  such a destiny which Israel itself presently today has no awareness, does not desire to be chosen has no inclination to be a nation of priests and light unto the world
13:12 -  what it really wants to be is the Hong Kong of the Middle East our Jewish motives stink they are not at all biblical
13:23 -  we are not at all biblically oriented we don't even believe the prophets we don't believe that the Bible is the word of God
13:32 -  it's a cultural contribution that we Jews have made for mankind it's a literature of fables in history but it's not the word of God
13:46 -  you understand the Jewish condition you dear saints? I'm not trying to encourage your anti-Semitism I'm trying to show you how great is the triumph of God
13:58 -  when he can succeed even over and against the unwillingness of those people to even know and fulfill such a destiny that's why the issue of Israel's restoration is the issue of God
14:17 -  because God has suffered loss he has become trivialized, sentimentalized, romanticized we have dealt with him shallowly
14:31 -  because our knowledge of God and the depth of our appreciation and adoration of worship is proportionate to the understanding we have of the magnitude of his glory
14:47 -  in the fulfillment of the issues of Israel given in his word and covenant we will have a lesser appreciation of God if we fail to reckon on the magnitude of the glory
15:04 -  that comes with the fulfillment of what is written and the covenant that I have made with them what is the condition?
15:14 -  when the fullness of the Gentiles come in the deliverer will come out of Zion and that's where you come in
15:25 -  some kind of fullness that God is wanting in the Chinese believers of Malaysia that when it is attained he will act upon Israel
15:41 -  because Israel is scheduled to be so reduced so lacking in any ability to save itself that its salvation must come from outside of itself
15:56 -  in the release for which God waits as he looks to the church to come to its own fullness you're caught up in a mystery
16:10 -  where the church of Malaysia is a more significant factor for Israel's redemption than Israel itself
16:21 -  for Israel is en route to becoming dry bones why is that, Brother Art? because we Jews are the personification of man
16:38 -  of flesh, of human ambition and human ability who else could take a malarial swampland that has been abandoned for millennia
16:51 -  and in half a century create a high tech civilization? take a dead liturgical language and make it modern Hebrew have the greatest air force and military power
17:04 -  proportion to its numbers in the world high tech society, high on the stock market high in electronics, high in arms
17:15 -  development and sale because we are man and God is not going to allow us to succeed
17:27 -  on the basis of our humanity for the issue of Israel is not its glorification but its God's
17:36 -  got the idea? and if God is more greatly glorified by raising up Israel from its death
17:46 -  then by allowing it to succeed on the basis of its own human powers and ability we need to understand
17:56 -  what is the issue and what is at stake because if you don't understand it you will be greatly disappointed
18:05 -  in how far God will allow present Israel, which I mean Jews worldwide to suffer such an eclipse
18:15 -  such a time of Jacob's trouble such an attrition that they will be uprooted out of the land
18:22 -  and out of the nations where they have known security and comfort till now and find themselves driven
18:31 -  and proliferated through all nations including Malaysia because it says
18:40 -  I will sift you through all nations Amos chapter 9 chapter 9 is the most comprehensive overview
18:50 -  of this whole apocalyptic last days sifting of uprooting through the nations
18:58 -  and the returning to Israel of a surviving remnant who will not again be plucked up or rooted out
19:05 -  and will be planted by the Lord in everlasting peace and security Amos chapter 9
19:13 -  so brace yourself you dear Chinese saints because we Jews love Chinese food and little will we expect it
19:29 -  in flight and in distress this is a remarkable saga S-A-G-A
19:38 -  a remarkable drama that in sifting and uprooting Israel Jews who knows where they will come from
19:47 -  not necessarily from the present state of Israel they might come from Australia I don't know where or how they will be uprooted
19:55 -  I've been to Panama Canal and I watched these great Chinese freighters loaded with what do they call these metal containers
20:08 -  I've never seen a ship stacked with containers so high coming with only two feet of water on each side to pass through the Panama Canal
20:17 -  and route from east to west well we have a dear Spanish speaking brother in Panama Canal who has translated apostolic foundations
20:28 -  and other of our things into Spanish Panama Canal is a key for the movement now of material
20:37 -  but one day for the movement of Jews maybe even in container metal container compartments
20:44 -  I don't know but I know this God is not only going to sift the Jew
20:51 -  he's going to sift the nations and the church of the nations through which they will pass
21:00 -  and when they come to you they're going to be unattractive mean-spirited
21:09 -  disillusioned bent out of shape because they will be uprooted suddenly
21:16 -  and lose everything in a day and find themselves only with what's on their back being sifted and being passed on to the
21:26 -  mercies of men from one place to another if there will be indeed any survival at all Jesus says in Matthew 24 and Luke 21
21:36 -  that this time of trouble will exceed anything that the nation has previously known
21:43 -  or will again know that means it will exceed the Nazi holocaust
21:53 -  that means that there will be a greater loss of life this time than then and so I'm estimating
22:01 -  that two-thirds of all present Jews will not survive the time of Jacob's trouble when Jesus himself comes
22:12 -  in the final conclusion himself with his feet on the Mount of Olives to war against those nations that have come against Jerusalem to destroy it
22:22 -  two-thirds have already perished the women have been ravished a half have gone into captivity
22:31 -  and if one-third is brought through the fire who will acknowledge that he is Lord and that he is their God
22:40 -  if two-thirds perish in the land what will be the ratio of Jews' survival anywhere in the world?
22:49 -  so what are you made of? what is your moral condition? what iron do you have in your soul?
22:58 -  can you live through a time in which you will personally witness the most drastic attrition
23:07 -  ever to come upon the Jewish people in their history? I don't know if I'll be able to take it will I crack?
23:16 -  will I collapse under the horror of this devastation in the world
23:25 -  where they will be universally hated in every nation if there's any survival
23:34 -  if there's the redeemed of the Lord who returned to Zion with everlasting joy upon their heads
23:43 -  and mourning and sighing fading away it will be because you have extended the power of mercy
23:52 -  you're in something this is ultimate drama this is ultimate conclusion of the age
24:01 -  where the issue of the church is the issue of Jewish survival Jewish salvation, Jewish return to Zion
24:10 -  why is that return so critical? why are the powers of darkness single minded about the annihilation of Jews
24:19 -  to obliterate them from off the face of the earth and the text that we are now about to consider
24:28 -  will explain it so this is the word that the son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem
24:37 -  it shall come to pass in the last days excuse my emphasis if you don't understand the issue of Israel
24:46 -  you have no key to the awareness that these are the last days and being as Jewish as you are
24:55 -  being Chinese I suspect that you do not have an abiding sense
25:04 -  of the ominous of the abiding sense of the ominous
25:13 -  understanding that these are the last days the fact of the matter is that we treat these days as all of our days
25:22 -  as one Sunday like another we cannot anticipate an apocalyptic disaster
25:31 -  a conclusion, a devastation we like security, we like comfort we like regularity
25:40 -  so we may even talk about the last days but we do not in our hearts really believe it
25:49 -  nor do we in our hearts desire it and that shows and robs us of the fullness of the Gentiles
25:58 -  for which God is waiting when the fullness of the Gentiles comes in it will be a church
26:07 -  that takes to itself deeply the ominous sense that these are the last days that there's a climactic conclusion
26:16 -  and a conflict between darkness and light that will require casualties and fatalities
26:25 -  that martyrs will again not be a rare phenomenon in the church but rather the conflict of an ultimate kind
26:34 -  as we come to the end of the days in the last days we need now to anticipate that
26:43 -  and prepare spiritually to understand that martyrdom is not such a great thing
26:52 -  in fact if it might even be considered a privileged thing especially if we are suffering it
27:02 -  for the sake of a Jewish people in order that they might be spared the devastation that would otherwise fall on them
27:11 -  because their return to Zion is the issue of the coming of their king and his kingdom
27:20 -  so this is a message for the last days which is our present time what shall come to pass
27:29 -  in verse 2 that the mountains of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills
27:38 -  and all nations shall flow into it I would say all includes Malaysia Singapore
27:47 -  the East, mainland China all nations shall flow into it my fellow saints
27:56 -  words fail me I have not the ability to begin to sketch
28:05 -  a sense of what this means because we need to go all the way back to Genesis chapter 11 and see the rebellion
28:14 -  of the nations against God in attempting to set up a tower higher than the heavens
28:23 -  to exalt themselves above God and to choose the location of themselves rather than where God would have them to be placed
28:32 -  that he had to confound their language and disperse them again to the places where they now exist as nations in the world
28:41 -  still in the spirit of rebellion against God oh Lord give me grace give them grace
28:50 -  to understand that there is an unbroken hostility the world is at enmity with God
28:59 -  if you love the world the love of the Father is not in you the world hates God
29:08 -  hates God's people hates God's church and does not want
29:17 -  to come under the authority of the Creator where do we read that rebellion
29:26 -  graphically powerfully in the Psalms Psalm 2
29:35 -  why do the heathen rage and take against the Lord
29:44 -  and against his anointed how many know this Psalm we need a crash program here
29:53 -  make a note of it read Psalm 2 because the heathen are still raging
30:02 -  and where rage is Satan is for they want to break their bands
30:12 -  asunder they don't want to come under the authority of the Lord and his anointed
30:21 -  but he holds them in derision and he says I have set my king on the holy hill of Zion
30:30 -  and given him the nations for his inheritance I told you that I have to communicate
30:40 -  an encyclopedic view if we had more time I could give it to you in installments
30:49 -  and now I'm beginning tonight with this most comprehensive overview of why it is
30:58 -  that Israel is hated and why its annihilation will be sought because if there's no return to Zion
31:07 -  then the Lord does not go forth the king does not come Israel's restoration to the land and to its God
31:16 -  is the issue of the king's coming and his kingdom how do you see that art
31:25 -  because it's the mountain of the Lord the word mountain in prophecy Zion is always a symbol
31:34 -  for government it shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow to it
31:43 -  it itself is a hill Zion is nothing impressive to look upon
31:52 -  Zion is not a great towering mountain range it's a hill
32:01 -  but it's a holy hill because the Lord has chosen it and put His name there
32:10 -  and it will be His sanctuary and His dwelling and the locus of His government and rule over all creation
32:19 -  because according to this text in verse 3 both the law and the word of the Lord
32:28 -  from Jerusalem believest thou this you cynical, empirical, factual
32:37 -  pragmatic Chinese Christians do you believe that the law will go forth out of Zion
32:46 -  and the word out of Jerusalem to all nations to the holy mountain
32:55 -  to honor God who has restored His ancient people despite their lack of qualification
33:04 -  and made their Jerusalem and their Zion the locus of His theocratic rule over all creation
33:13 -  for He will set His king on the holy hill of Zion in the face of stark unbelief
33:22 -  of stark unexpectedly that only wants to see an improvement
33:31 -  in human government perhaps and does not actually believe that God Himself will rule as king
33:40 -  from the throne of David to which He alone is qualified to go forth out of Zion
33:49 -  and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem to all nations do you desire that
33:58 -  do you believe for that do you pant for that when you say come Lord Jesus what are you praying
34:07 -  come and have me to escape or come and bring your kingdom and your glory not just to observe that kingdom
34:16 -  but to share and have part in its administration how many of you will rule over five cities
34:25 -  and how many of you over ten how many of you will not rule over anything because you're not presently
34:34 -  in a place of authority because your children are running circles around you now because you're not facing the real issues of life
34:43 -  and obedience because you have no stomach for judgment or chastisement because you want it easy and nice and pleasant
34:52 -  you are disqualified to rule and reign with Christ as overcomers don't you know dear saints
35:01 -  that this life is a preparation for millennial and eternal participation in the kingdom of God
35:10 -  and every day in every way you're facing issues of choice and responsibility that either build character for the kingdom
35:19 -  or disqualify you for its participation if you but understood that alone how much would it affect
35:28 -  your present Christianity a lot this sounds very poetic maybe Isaiah was just being carried away
35:37 -  with some kind of vision but you make it sound so literal as if something specific in a governmental way
35:46 -  will go out from that place that God has chosen and affect all nations what makes you think so how can you prove by the text
35:55 -  that this is nothing more than just fanciful consideration it's literal
36:04 -  because the text itself indicates that he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people
36:13 -  they shall beat their swords into plowshares their spears into punahooks neither shall they learn war anymore
36:22 -  hey listen guys didn't I say that the issue of Israel is the issue of the word the issue of interpretation
36:31 -  the issue of exegesis of drawing out the meaning of determining whether something is literal or spiritual
36:40 -  what does the text say they will turn their swords into plowshares their spears into punahooks
36:49 -  they will study war no more because they will not engage in war anymore
36:58 -  because the king has come because there's righteousness in the earth because he will counsel the nations
37:07 -  and resolve their disputes and their inequities because he comes in judgment and in righteousness to rule
37:16 -  you think about the Lord as king don't you really believe that is your government upon his shoulder
37:25 -  for the increase of his government and of his peace there shall be no end so who determines
37:34 -  where and when you take your vacation what you do with your money who you're going to marry
37:43 -  what school you're going to, what career you're choosing I know you only too well too Jewish, practical
37:52 -  making decisions yourself independent of him so how shall we believe
38:01 -  for his rule over the nations when he has not a thorough rule over the church did you think I was playing when I began to pray
38:10 -  Lord what about tonight we don't want them to spend this occasion with a lot of good things that could be spoken
38:19 -  what is your specific intent and design for this night because I'm naive enough to believe
38:28 -  that this night was ordained as a work of God before the foundations of the earth were laid if you have an attitude like that
38:37 -  that's an apostolic view if you have an attitude like that I've come off of a plane after 24 hours
38:46 -  of a 15 hour flight from L.A. to Hong Kong and then a 3 hour layover and another 4 hour flight from Hong Kong to
38:55 -  Kuala Lumpur and I really have made a 4 hour flight from Minnesota to Los Angeles
39:04 -  and an hour and a half flight from Bemidji to Minneapolis you know what you have to say and this is a once and for all occasion
39:13 -  that he's intended before the foundations of the earth were laid who is sufficient for these things
39:22 -  when have you said that last when have you lived with that kind of earnest thought that your works
39:31 -  and your acts have everything to do with the fulfillment of the sovereign will of God
39:40 -  established before the foundations of the earth were laid that there's nothing casual, shallow, accidental that should in any way characterize our life
39:49 -  that we should be living the most earnest and significant daily walk corporately and individually
40:07 -  you
