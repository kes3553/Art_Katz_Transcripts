The Symphonic Overture

00:00 -  Good evening, dear Saints. It's already an extraordinary evening, and I think the Lord will continue to make it extraordinary. Because I came out of my room this evening humming Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Da da da da, da da da da.
00:20 -  Because tonight is symphonic, because the theme tonight lends itself to orchestration. It's vast, it's majestic. I don't have a word for it. This epical statement of God revealed in one place only the mystery of Israel and the Church.
00:46 -  That remarkable segment of Paul's apostolic consciousness, the heart of his whole perception of reality. Romans chapters 9 through 11. It's not an addendum, it's not an asterisk, it's not a footnote, it's not at the end of the book. It's smack dab, straight in the middle. That everything the scholars say from chapters 1 through 8 are preparation.
01:20 -  The chapters 12 through 16 are the out-folding and the out-working. But the heart of the book of Romans, Paul's most systematic statement, and he's not a systematic theologian. But in this one book, in the answer to the question of the Church of Rome, is God finished with the Jew?
01:43 -  Paul sets forth a view of such a kind that can only be touched and expressed symphonically. So I wish I had a baton, I would click the podium and call the orchestra to attention and sound the great theme. So let's begin both with the first verse of chapter 9 and the last verse of chapter 11.
02:13 -  Just to see how Paul commences and how Paul concludes. Because the first verse of chapter 9 is a note of grief, deep agony of soul. I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow.
02:41 -  Other versions say grief, anguish of soul in my heart. For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh. So the symphony is sounded with a, it's a low note, it's a heavy note, it's a weighty note.
03:05 -  But unless it begins like that, it cannot end on the triumphant statement that concludes these three chapters in Romans 11 from verse 33. Oh the depth of the riches, are you with me? Are you found the place? Romans 11, 33.
03:26 -  Oh the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out. For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has been his counselor?
03:40 -  For who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever. Amen.
03:57 -  I don't sing that for you at the conclusion of this night or sometime in these days. Pursue me. We sing this at Ben Israel.
04:08 -  It lends itself to music, it's symphonic, it's great, it's epical. To him be glory forever. That's not Paul tacking on a little nondescript word of little meaning.
04:26 -  But that the glory of God that is affected by the restoration of Israel in the last days after millennial apostasy through a gentile church is a theme of such note and such ultimate worth and revelation of God in his mercy and his essential character
04:45 -  that it will reverberate for him forever. The church that is not forever minded is non-apostolic. So we want to enter into this remarkable symphonic sweep
05:04 -  that begins with a note of lament and grief with a strickenness for the condition of his brethren that he would even wish himself a curse
05:15 -  that they might know Christ and ends with this triumphant doxology of praise Oh the death of the riches
05:22 -  Listen you dear saints when's the last time that you exclaimed Oh
05:29 -  that one letter word is profound Oh it's not a word it's a gesticulation it's a gasp
05:39 -  Oh the death of the riches it raises the question what has Paul seen that brings a sober Jew of this kind
05:48 -  to such an exclamation that is beyond sentiment or shallow emotion This isn't Paul emoting
05:56 -  this is a man who is deep in God and something has struck the inmost corridors of his soul
06:03 -  of such magnitude and such weight that the only thing by which he could conclude with this measure of praise is
06:12 -  Oh the death of the riches Oh it's like a man being hit in the gut in the solar plexus he doubles over
06:20 -  Oh it raises the question what has he seen that we have not yet seen
06:26 -  because we ourselves have not yet come to this exclamation You dear saints
06:35 -  God will give us the spirit of revelation tonight to begin to glimpse what Paul has seen and what he describes as a mystery
06:44 -  of which he would not have us to be ignorant Reverend lest we become wise in our own conceit you will be exclaiming
06:51 -  Oh also and I think you need to I think you need to move from
06:59 -  this terrible beginning of I would wish myself accursed the strickenness, the grief
07:06 -  that ends with the ecstasy because I don't think you can end with the ecstasy unless you begin with the grief
07:13 -  but of course what reason would you have being Chinese or Indian or what you are
07:19 -  exotic colors, shapes and sizes for what reason would you say I would wish myself accursed
07:27 -  for what reason would you feel stricken for the fallen condition of a people who are not your brethren
07:35 -  so of course we can only ascribe this to Paul because he's speaking only out of his Jewish ethnic identity
07:42 -  for his own kinsmen and that exempts you from any necessity to feel a grief of that depth
07:50 -  and because you don't feel the grief of that depth you are permanently shut out and limited to a range of emotion and life
07:59 -  that is beneath God's intention for you and that would have otherwise revealed His glory you're shallow, all too shallow
08:08 -  one dimensional, all too one dimensional because the only thing calculated to bring you into a depth of apostolic range
08:17 -  of emotion, feeling, thought and consideration is the mystery of Israel itself you bet you're not Jewish
08:28 -  and you could have identified and share Paul's grief but let me ask you
08:34 -  though you're not Jewish are not this people equally your kinsmen
08:41 -  are they not your brethren and who are the least of these his brethren
08:48 -  to whom we shall be bidden to express mercy that we might enter the kingdom prepared for us in Matthew 25 as reward
08:56 -  are you getting me? listen the issue of kinsmen and brethren
09:02 -  is more than the issue of ethnic and racial identity it's the issue of spiritual identity and if they are the least of the Lord's brethren
09:11 -  but His brethren even in their unbelieving condition what ought they to be for you? here's what I want to tell you
09:19 -  Paul is grieved in his deeps not because he's a Jew in identification with his own natural kinsmen
09:27 -  but because he's an apostle because he's an apostle he's sounding the heart of God
09:37 -  that's the grief that's being expressed and so to whatever degree we are apostolic
09:45 -  we have access and right to express and know the same degree of grief
09:51 -  because if we don't begin with the grief we'll not end with the ecstasy I'm pleading for the Church of Asia tonight
10:00 -  to save it from a one-dimensionalism of being merely charismatically correct I don't know how to express it
10:08 -  we've got to come out of our skins there's got to be something expansive that has come into our souls
10:18 -  that is uniquely the consequence of the beholding of a mystery that is at the very heart of God
10:26 -  and the center of Paul's apostolic consciousness in the greatest book of Romans but I'll tell you what
10:33 -  once you begin with the grief and end with the ecstasy over Israel you'll go on
10:41 -  in a range and depth of emotion and reality that eclipses Israel
10:48 -  and touches every question there's something about the mystery of Israel I don't have a word for it
10:54 -  there's a dynamic there's a something in the nature of it
11:06 -  that once we perceive it eclipses and exceeds even the issue of Israel itself
11:12 -  it even eclipses and exceeds the issue of the Church itself because the one issue
11:18 -  that eclipses both Israel and the Church is the glory of God forever and once you have tasted that
11:27 -  and been lifted in that exhilaration through the revelation of the mystery it will touch every other consideration
11:34 -  that ever comes before you everything in your future will be affected subsequently
11:40 -  once you have been inducted into the mystery of which Paul says
11:46 -  he would not have you to be ignorant reverent so we're not going to go through
11:52 -  a verse to verse exposition of three chapters but I want to just touch
11:58 -  some of the highlights of the concluding chapter chapter 7
12:04 -  which is the heart of the heart of the great mystery here's the apostle
12:10 -  faced with a question by the Church of Rome is God finished with the Jew? has Israel blown it?
12:16 -  have they exhausted their last grace having stoned the prophets
12:22 -  and now crucified the Lord of glory is God finished with them? and are we now the Church
12:28 -  the new Israel of God we replace them and we take over where they left
12:34 -  and we complete what they failed to perform Paul's answer to that question
12:40 -  what shall I say? the weight and the fate
12:46 -  of the Church its destiny its call, its significance
12:52 -  not only for the Jew but for the Gentile also rests on our understanding and apprehension
12:58 -  Paul answers this question and in my experience in my 42 years in the Lord
13:04 -  and crossing paths and touching the lives of significant ministers
13:10 -  who have confessed to me I don't know what it is but I have never understood Romans 11
13:16 -  it's a mystery to me that I've never understood pity
13:22 -  because it's at the heart of Paul how is it you understand other things other ministers
13:28 -  are you having some difficulty is there some barrier is there some Gentile pride
13:34 -  that keeps you from being able to comprehend the mystery because mysteries only come
13:40 -  as being revealed what is obstructing the revelation seeing that you know so much
13:46 -  about other apostolic themes what keeps you from the apprehension of this
13:52 -  is there something deep Gentile pride that is loathe
13:58 -  and resistant to recognize that there's yet a destiny for this nation
14:04 -  despite its fallenness despite its undeservedness and you're loathe to grant what God wants to extend in mercy
14:12 -  you will not elect what God will elect you will not choose what he chooses there's something stubborn
14:18 -  and difficult at the heart of Gentile pride and nothing more reveals it
14:24 -  on the issue of Israel and the Jew as God sets it forth in this magnificent chapter
14:32 -  so how does Paul answer the question I say then verse 1 of chapter 11
14:38 -  has God cast away his people God forbid
14:44 -  I don't read Greek I don't know Greek but I'm told that in Greek
14:50 -  his statement is the most devastating final ultimate
14:56 -  convicting expression that could be given to the rejection of the thought
15:02 -  that God has cast away his people God forbid let it be the farthest
15:08 -  consideration from you don't even intimate or ever consider that God has finished
15:14 -  God forbid that you should take that as your thought for I am also an Israelite
15:20 -  the seed of Abraham the tribe of Benjamin because if God has cast away his people what am I doing
15:26 -  as a believer that my very salvation is an indication he's not totally
15:32 -  cast away there's a remnant there are people yet to be saved and redeemed
15:38 -  finally even all Israel will be saved as we read later on in verse 26
15:44 -  and so he goes on to develop his thought which we will not
15:50 -  and have not the time to attend and even quotes from
15:56 -  the section in Isaiah chapter 6 which we have been considering in these days
16:02 -  verse 7 what then Israel hath not obtained this which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it
16:08 -  and the rest were blinded according as it is written written where
16:14 -  in Isaiah chapter 6 that God hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that
16:20 -  they should not see ears that they should not hear unto this day the curse
16:26 -  pronounced upon them by the man who said who shall go for a send me still
16:32 -  it remains they're blinded they're out of it
16:38 -  but they're being out of it temporarily it's not a permanent rejection
16:44 -  and it's serving certain purposes of God that has to do with the goyim
16:50 -  with the gentiles that somehow their momentary historic
16:56 -  removal makes place for the same gospel to come to
17:02 -  those who were before would never candidates
17:08 -  gentiles is a mystery that Paul is beginning to unfold something has to do
17:14 -  with Israel being set aside necessarily in blindness and judgment
17:20 -  in a right judgment of their sin
17:26 -  but it opens a door for the consideration of the gentiles for what purpose
17:32 -  because he says then in verse 11 have they stumbled that they should fall is a permanent
17:38 -  disqualification God forbid again
17:44 -  uses the very strong language but rather through their fall salvation
17:50 -  is to come unto the gentiles for or so as to provoke them
17:56 -  to jealousy here we hear a theme is being introduced
18:08 -  a mystery is being unfolded yes they're set aside but there's a strategic
18:14 -  consideration in the mind of God the genius of God that has
18:20 -  that makes it necessary that the salvation might come to the gentiles
18:26 -  not to enjoy it in themselves as an end in itself but so as to provoke
18:32 -  them to jealousy there's a reason for your salvation you dear saints
18:38 -  that you have not yet considered before tonight your salvation is not the end in itself
18:44 -  it's a means to an end a great end in the redemptive genius of God
18:50 -  for a fallen Israel sake that because salvation has come to you through their
18:56 -  fall you might move them to jealousy by the fruit which you exhibit
19:02 -  by having received their covenantal blessing which they have disowned by their sin
19:08 -  and in such a way so conspicuously as to move them to jealousy because being Chinese
19:14 -  and Oriental you're essentially more Hebraic than even they are you're exhibiting the fruit
19:20 -  that they themselves should have born something has happened where the Jew least expects
19:26 -  to find it with the gentiles there's a purpose a purpose for your salvation beyond
19:32 -  yourself and in fact this purpose saves us from an egocentrism
19:38 -  even of a spiritual kind by which we are the measure of all things the church, its benefit
19:44 -  its blessing, its numbers, its program its budget, us us us us what saves us from
19:50 -  that inveterate self-centeredness that was with us in the world and is now
19:56 -  presently with us in the church no longer of a carnal kind but now of a religious or a spiritual kind
20:02 -  we, us, me the church, our program, my denomination, my ministry
20:08 -  it's a consideration to which we're called beyond ourselves and outside
20:14 -  of ourselves to move them to jealousy while in the same
20:20 -  chapter we're told they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake
20:26 -  customers you would have been afraid to pick me up off the side of the road 42 years ago
20:32 -  as a hitchhiking Jewish atheist I was a foreboding, angry looking man, tough
20:38 -  but praise God for those who stopped there's no tougher opponent to the gospel
20:44 -  than the Jew we not only reject it but we have our alternative messianic
20:50 -  programs, one of which is called Marxism and Communism or socialism or every kind of
20:56 -  ism or harebrained thing that men can conceive as messianic alternatives we Jews have invented
21:02 -  we are the enemies of the gospel and you're in a shallow condition
21:08 -  because you have not met us and confronted us and challenged us with the foolishness of the scandal
21:14 -  of the gospel nothing more reveals the absurdity of the message that we're called
21:20 -  to bear than bringing it to an erudite sophisticated and accomplished Jew
21:26 -  we're not talking about some drunk rolling in the gutter who knows he's lost we're talking about men
21:32 -  accomplished in the world where the world is essentially a Jewish world
21:38 -  it's designed like Marx and Freud
21:44 -  and Steven Spielberg and Einstein that the three greatest
21:50 -  geniuses of the 20th century who have set the whole tone and content and structure of the modern world
21:56 -  happen to be Jews when you touch a Jew you're not just touching an ethnic
22:02 -  minority, you're touching a people who are at the heart of a world system they'll mash upon you
22:08 -  with their teeth I'm understating the case
22:14 -  that God has given us a formidable opponent and they have every reason
22:20 -  to reject our message there are Jews who will cross the street rather than allow
22:26 -  the shadow of the spire of a church to fall upon them if it has a cross they can't bear to hear the name
22:32 -  Jesus, because in that name Christ they have been persecuted and hounded and raped
22:38 -  and pillaged and destroyed through the centuries every crusade was financed by looting
22:44 -  Jewish communities in Europe Jews locked themselves in their synagogues as a final defense
22:50 -  and the synagogues were burned to the ground the great church in Esslingen, Germany
22:56 -  where I have such a remarkable identification having been a GI in Germany
23:02 -  was built over the ruins of the synagogue burned in the middle ages by the crusaders
23:08 -  where the entire Jewish community was burned to a crisp because they would rather die and sanctify
23:14 -  the name of their God than to be baptized as Christians
23:20 -  you've got your work cut out for you and you're not going to have to run through New York to meet Jews, they'll be coming here
23:26 -  as I hope to show you in subsequent talks God will proliferate
23:32 -  them throughout all nations not only to sift them through the nations, but to sift the nations
23:38 -  through them because the measure by which God will be eternally determined, the destiny
23:44 -  of goats and sheep was over one question in Matthew 25 what did you do
23:50 -  for the least of these my brethren if they're not your brethren
23:56 -  as they are his brethren you're not likely to do anything especially if the doing
24:02 -  of anything will imperil your life and threaten your security and that of your family
24:08 -  and why should you do it? For them what did they ever do for you? besides supporting Chinese
24:14 -  restaurants don't you understand the mystery that a Gentile
24:20 -  church is willing to extend itself sacrificially for a people who are
24:26 -  different and other than their own that by every natural human reckoning
24:32 -  Gentiles should be envious, spiteful critical of Jews
24:38 -  and when they come to us they'll be in the condition that deserves that assessment
24:44 -  and yet you're going to be kind and generous and loving and gracious because as
24:50 -  says in Ezekiel 20 the Lord says I'll meet with you in the wilderness of the nations face to face
24:56 -  I'm saved because in Gentile faces I saw the light that lightens
25:02 -  the goyim and the glory of the people Israel I couldn't see it in the glory
25:08 -  of the people Israel now in their apostate condition but I saw it in the face of that girl that I met
25:14 -  in Europe 42 years ago who had graduated high school and was on vacation and I don't
25:20 -  know how we bumped together and walked the woods surrounding this Swiss city and I'm probing
25:26 -  her motives I'm a disillusioned ex-Marxist, a humanist with failed
25:32 -  expectation for mankind terribly disillusioned and hopeless and here's this little girl being nice to me
25:38 -  I'm probing her motives hey why are you being kind to me I'm a stranger why aren't you afraid I'm fearful
25:44 -  oh she said it's the love of God listen I don't have patience
25:50 -  with religious cliches having come out of political cliches love of God
25:56 -  so we walked a little further how come you're being kind it's the love of God how come it's the love of God
26:02 -  this kid mentions the love of God one more time she's had it my hobby is to find Christians and wipe
26:08 -  them out what is this little girl to me so she mentioned God once
26:14 -  more I said look you're a nice kid appreciate your kindness but I want to tell you I cannot
26:20 -  stand this God talk it rubs me raw where was God in the
26:26 -  holocaust where was God where in this world that's collapsing and is on the verge
26:32 -  of atomic annihilation and the racial discord and where's God God
26:38 -  don't give me this God talk I said tell me answer me one question that no Christian has ever successfully
26:44 -  answered for me you're talking about God how do you know that he is I thought I got her
26:50 -  now what's she going to tell me some little brittle answer she learned in Sunday school I'll roll
26:56 -  over her with my intellectual steamroller and leave her in the dust so she raised her little
27:04 -  gentile face to me and I mean gentile face snub
27:10 -  nose freckled sandy haired she came from the midwest
27:16 -  in America what we Jews call a wasp a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant and she
27:22 -  lifted that face to me beaming with the light of God and she said I know art that God
27:28 -  lives because he lives in me and down went the ox
27:34 -  fell boom I went down I mean I stood but
27:40 -  there was an inward collapse because that simple answer was not a cliche
27:46 -  there was a power to that statement because that little gentile face proved it
27:52 -  there was something in that face it was the light that lightens the gentiles which is
27:58 -  equally the glory of the people Israel and I'll tell you what university graduate
28:04 -  that I was well traveled man that I was pseudo intellectual that I was I was made for the first time
28:10 -  jealous but what this little gentile girl had in the simplicity of her
28:16 -  faith and that I lacked in my cynicism and overwhelming discouragement as a
28:22 -  man in the world that's how God began with me since you need to read the book
28:28 -  Ben Israel because it's the record of a man uprooted from California
28:34 -  brought out of the teaching profession in a years leave of absence traveling with a pack on his back depending
28:40 -  upon the mercy of those who will pick him up and extend grace
28:46 -  through 14 months of travel through the whole of Europe and the Middle East concluding in Israel
28:52 -  where God called me by name in a messianic bookstore
28:58 -  it's a picture of the future it's a microcosm of a soon coming macrocosm of Jews being uprooted
29:04 -  from their places of security and their categories their mental categories
29:10 -  and values uprooted loose and then filtered and sifted through the nations that they
29:16 -  might be picked up that they might be encountered that the face of God might be revealed to them that they might
29:22 -  see in the faces of Chinese believers what I saw in the face of that little waspish girl in the outskirts
29:28 -  of Zurich it's the mystery you dear saints
29:34 -  and you need to be conscious of it and anticipation of it and already sing to the
29:40 -  issues that will affect your face this is a great verse Romans 11
29:46 -  11 may it be branded on your hearts it's the heart of the mystery
29:52 -  where Paul begins to introduce that there is a reciprocal relationship
29:58 -  between Israel and the church that God has ordained something in his own
30:04 -  supreme wisdom that has to do with entities who are in history
30:10 -  at enmity with each other there's no reason why a gentile
30:16 -  should dispose himself toward a Jew and so exhibit something as to move a Jew
30:22 -  who is the natural enemy of the gospel to a jealousy so as to quartake of it
30:28 -  it means what kind of exhibition are you going to make what are you going to demonstrate that will move
30:34 -  Jews to jealousy what your chorus is your superior services Paul doesn't tell us there's no footnote
30:42 -  but it implies a demonstration of an ultimate kind that for the want of
30:48 -  a better word is heavenly it's a reality that Jews would have never before ever seen
30:54 -  in fact it's probably the same thing spoken of in Ephesians 3 10 it's the
31:00 -  wisdom of God demonstrated through the church which is what God is in
31:06 -  himself and his nature and his character which can never be revealed sufficiently through
31:12 -  an individual virtuoso saint but only through the relationship between saints
31:18 -  that when they come to you in the communities that you will have established
31:24 -  which are also places of refuge and flight you receive them in the corporate strength
31:30 -  of the body that is there and has passed through its own trials and preparations
31:36 -  so when the Jews come however offensive offensive and mean-spirited you will not be discouraged by them
31:42 -  you're going to be tested you're going to be ungrateful you're going to be mean-spirited
31:48 -  they're full of prejudice they attribute their distress that has come upon them suddenly to the
31:54 -  collapse of the church to the fraudulence of Christianity itself and you're a Christian and you're
32:00 -  taking them in and if you need their approval and you don't get it and if they're mean-spirited speak back
32:06 -  to you if they don't like your wonton soup and you don't have bagels in the freezer
32:12 -  and you offend them how will you react? What you do?
32:18 -  What your face shows? If you're merely only polite in the Chinese manner
32:24 -  all you're exhibiting is a Chinese culture but if you show the face of God
32:30 -  in unconditional love that cannot be offended against you have transcended what is Chinese
32:36 -  and you have indicated and shown a kingdom of another and a heavenly kind
32:42 -  but I want to tell you you'll not succeed in that certain moment when it comes if you are not in preparation from now
32:48 -  there's a strategy of a divine kind that's breathtaking they have fallen
32:54 -  but so that salvation might come to the Gentiles
33:00 -  in order to provoke them to jealousy may you succeed in that
33:06 -  in the appointed time because if the fall of them be the riches of the world
33:12 -  and the diminishing then the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness
33:18 -  this blessing has already come to the Gentiles for salvation what will their return
33:24 -  mean? Paul is implying there will be a return God has not permanently cast away
33:30 -  this people there is yet a destiny to be fulfilled and it will only be fulfilled
33:36 -  as we will see later on in this chapter through the mercy that comes to them especially and exclusively
33:42 -  through a Gentile church why should you at risk and
33:48 -  peril extend yourself for people who are not like you and are other than you and are more likely
33:54 -  to be the objects of your envy or your criticism than your love
34:00 -  because in your ability to identify with them and for them you are at the same time
34:06 -  fulfilling the mystery of Ephesians 3 10 you are demonstrating another wisdom
34:12 -  you have broken through the power of self interest and things as they concern you
34:18 -  and you are living for and willing to sacrifice for another that is the wisdom of
34:24 -  God portrayed by Jesus at the cross and will be portrayed by the church
34:30 -  in his response to the Jew in the last days fulfilling the mystery of Ephesians
34:36 -  while it fulfills the mystery of Romans it's sufficient for these things
34:42 -  certainly it's going to require something more than we understand by Charismatic and it's that
34:48 -  something more that glorifies God through the church forever because at the
34:54 -  same time that God is through the church restoring Israel the church has come
35:00 -  to such a place of stature and beauty of character and nature and life
35:06 -  exhibiting the very magnanimity and graciousness of the Lord himself to an undeserving
35:12 -  and unappreciative people that the Lord not only has by it a restored Israel
35:18 -  he has a bride for the bridegroom how did you think you were going to attain that bridal status
35:24 -  by magic you're going to attain it by the crisis of Israel
35:30 -  that requires you to be Christ like that's the mystery
35:36 -  can you see it can you say oh the depth of the riches this is phenomenal
35:42 -  that a crisis of necessity comes to us as Gentiles as the church
35:48 -  brought about by Israel in its abject condition in the last days and time of Jacob's trouble
35:54 -  that compels us to meet them on such a ground and in such a spirituality
36:00 -  that we would never ever have sought for ourselves nor attained unless this crisis
36:06 -  of necessity had come upon us through them that God is using
36:12 -  unbelieving Jews an apostate nation to bring the church to a
36:18 -  place of ultimacy in God by which it is fitted to be a bride
36:24 -  for the bridegroom having the glory of God for the depth of the riches
36:30 -  both of the wisdom and knowledge of God to use the one for the other
36:36 -  that unbelieving Jews in their untoward and apostate condition
36:42 -  heightened by the sudden uprooting of the last days in the time of Jacob's trouble
36:48 -  is the very factor that precipitates and compels us to an ultimate spirituality
36:54 -  and being to them what we ought that fits us for our own eternal destiny
37:00 -  unless it comes to you by revelation by speaking as vain
37:06 -  but our hope and our prayer is that the speaking will itself constitute revelation to those
37:12 -  whose hearts are disposed to receive it because Paul would not have you to be ignorant of this mystery, brethren
37:18 -  lest you become wise in your own conceit it's the one mystery
37:24 -  that if you fail to apprehend it there are terrible negative consequences you become
37:30 -  swollen with conceit you become hot shot you become the kingdom now
37:36 -  you're going to take over the world you're going to take over all institutions and society
37:42 -  but you yourself are going to do it in fact you are even now the kingdom that's
37:48 -  that's vanity, that's pride that's being swollen in your own conceit which is the inevitable
37:54 -  consequence of the failure to receive this revelation because this revelation by its nature
38:00 -  tempers the church humbles it gives it a
38:08 -  a mood of understanding that saves it from
38:14 -  going off into its own conceit see the benefit, the remarkable
38:20 -  consequences in the issue of this mystery that is central to Paul's whole apostolic
38:26 -  consideration of the faith but it's not yet central to you
38:32 -  until it is, you have no claim to be apostolic and when it will be
38:38 -  it will make requirement of you of so ultimate a kind that the only
38:44 -  way that it can be fulfilled is on the basis of his resurrection life
38:50 -  which is the basis by which I am speaking tonight and all the other speakings
38:56 -  because this mystery dear saints as Romans 11 33 through 36
39:02 -  says is of him but it is also through him
39:08 -  that it might be to him as glory forever in a word
39:14 -  God is calling the church to an ultimate call of a kind
39:20 -  which it cannot fulfill on its own fundamental evangelistic or even charismatic
39:26 -  ability it requires the ultimacy of his spirit
39:32 -  and of his life you cannot meet the contingency of the crisis that comes
39:38 -  with Israel as will be forced upon you in the last days in Malaysia
39:44 -  but the result is how much more their fullness for I speak to you gentiles
39:50 -  in as much as I am an apostle of the gentiles I magnify my office did you ever wonder
39:56 -  why God took a fisherman Peter and makes him the apostle to the circumcision and takes a great
40:02 -  rabbinical student of the rabbi Gamaliel and makes him the apostle to the gentiles
40:08 -  isn't that a confusion of roles isn't that misusing the remarkable background and equipment that Paul
40:14 -  had as the Hebraic sage that he was why would God make him
40:20 -  the apostle to the gentiles because the issue of the gentiles is the issue of
40:26 -  Israel's redemption why because it confounds the wisdom
40:32 -  of the world that gentiles should be willing to extend themselves for another
40:38 -  who is different and other than themselves and to do it at a time and in a condition
40:44 -  in which they will not receive any necessary gratitude and their ability to extend
40:50 -  mercy and to be what they are what they ought and reveal the face of God in unconditional love
40:56 -  indicates that the church has come to a qualitative place of another
41:02 -  kind of an ultimate kind that for the want of a better word we can describe as bridal
41:08 -  it would not have come to it except to the crisis of necessity brought by the Jews in that
41:14 -  condition this is a mystery it's a mystery that he requires to be fulfilled
41:20 -  and it will be in the last days that they might return to Zion as the redeemed
41:26 -  of the Lord there will be a remarkable harmony for the redeemed Israel in the earth
41:32 -  and a glorified church in the heavens now fulfilling the places made vacant
41:38 -  by the displaced angelic realm that has fallen formerly called the principalities
41:44 -  and powers of the air so that you that will be occupying those offices
41:50 -  some of you will be ruling over five cities and some over ten but for the first time
41:56 -  there's a harmony both in heaven and earth with a redeemed Israel in the earth and a glorified church in the heavenlies
42:02 -  ascending and descending upon the son of man so Paul says if by any means
42:08 -  I may provoke the emulation them which are of my flesh and might save some of them for if they're casting away
42:14 -  in verse 15 be the reconciliation the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving
42:20 -  of them be but life from the death you cannot estimate what Israel's restoration
42:26 -  will mean fulfill their calling and their destiny the nation of priests and the light into the world
42:32 -  because if priests don't come to us which is their election and call
42:38 -  how shall we discern the difference between the profane and the holy only priests can
42:44 -  instruct us only priests can be the example we need to have a redeemed Israel sending its
42:50 -  representatives into Malaysia and into Asia and into Africa and into all the
42:56 -  nations of the world to bring that quotient and dimension of the meaning of holiness and what is sacred
43:02 -  to those who could not obtain it except by their demonstration because God has called them
43:08 -  and the election and the callings of God are without repentance they are irrevocable
43:14 -  Paul says this in Romans 11 we're going to see it the gift and callings of God
43:20 -  are irrevocable once he's called a nation to be a nation of priests and light into the world
43:26 -  they have to fulfill that because if they don't how is God God
43:32 -  the issue of Israel's restoration is the issue of God as God he's made a covenant with
43:38 -  them and promises that does not rest upon their virtue
43:44 -  because their track record stinks and will become worse before the end it has nothing to do with their
43:50 -  ability to attain on the basis of their merit but solely on the exclusive
43:56 -  grace that is given in mercy because God is God
44:02 -  the issue of Israel's restoration is the issue of God not just in the last
44:08 -  days but his glory forever for if the first
44:14 -  root be holy the lump is also holy in verse 16 if the root be holy saw the branches and if some of the branches
44:20 -  were broken off and you being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them and with them
44:26 -  quartakest of the root and fatnest of the olive tree don't boast against the branches but if you boast
44:32 -  thou bears not the root the root bears you you will say but the branch is broken
44:38 -  off that I might be grafted in yes true well because of unbelief they were broken off
44:44 -  and you stand by faith but be don't be high minded but fear
44:50 -  for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he spare not you behold therefore the goodness
44:56 -  and severity of God on them which fell severity but towards the goodness if you continue in his goodness
45:02 -  otherwise thou shall be cut off and they also if they abide not in unbelief shall be
45:08 -  grafted in for God is able to graft them in again what a remarkable
45:14 -  picture of wild olive branches
45:20 -  wild branches that could not bear fruit being wild they can only become fruitful
45:26 -  by being grafted into one tree which is Israel and if they're too proud
45:32 -  to be part of that tree and they don't like the looks of it it's too gnarled it's too ugly
45:38 -  its history has been too desperate and they would prefer to be a New Testament entity called
45:44 -  the church independent of the Jew they will be fruitless through an eternal
45:52 -  sense of the word because fruit only issues from the sap and the sap only issues from the root
45:58 -  which is the tree of Israel even in its present apostate condition
46:04 -  you've been grafted in until you're conscious of that grafting and grateful for
46:10 -  it you cannot appropriate the sap that you might be made fruitful and if you're
46:16 -  not fruitful by what means shall you move them to jealousy something needs to come into
46:22 -  the consciousness of the church even the Chinese church maybe especially the Chinese
46:28 -  church especially the Asian church because it's so removed from what they think is the western Jew
46:34 -  is your identity and relationship the intrinsic binding by
46:40 -  the mystery of God with that people as being part with them in the commonwealth of Israel
46:46 -  who were formerly far off without God who has a hope in the world and were brought nigh by the blood of Jesus
46:52 -  until you know that really know that really appreciate that really are grateful
46:58 -  for that you can't partake of the root nor will you welcome them back into their own tree
47:04 -  but if you were able to be grafted in wild thing that you were fruitless
47:10 -  you would have been doomed to be limited to that kind of puerile activity
47:16 -  except that the privilege of being grafted in to that tree and if you could be grafted
47:22 -  and made fruitful how about the natural branches if they be grafted in again
47:28 -  my first assemblies of God my pastor said I've never seen a convert like you Art
47:34 -  you took more notes you sucked up everything you drained me in 3 months
47:40 -  6 months you got anything and everything that I had to give I've never seen such an insatiable
47:46 -  new believer sucking up this stuff as if it's his nature
47:52 -  which indeed it is I was grafted back in to my own tree
47:58 -  God is able to graft them in again and will be glorified
48:04 -  thereby forever so don't you boast but pray for
48:10 -  their return because what will their return be but life from the dead
48:16 -  for in verse 25 I would not brethren that you should be ignorant
48:22 -  of this mystery listen saints you can have an appreciation for the
48:28 -  state of Israel and desire its success and even go and plant trees
48:34 -  and go to the feast of tabernacles and have all that nice
48:40 -  sentimental and schmaltzy stuff that blesses your soul but you're missing
48:46 -  the mystery I want to make this clear to you merely to have an affinity
48:52 -  for the present state of Israel and pray for two minutes for the peace of Jerusalem
48:58 -  is not the same as understanding and receiving the mystery of Israel
49:04 -  that makes of the church an ultimate requirement that can only be met on resurrection ground
49:10 -  it's cheaper and easier to plant a tree than to be a saint of the resurrection and move Jews to
49:16 -  jealousy by something that you exhibit corporately in the quality of the life of your fellowship
49:22 -  which is no better word than heavenly in fact we would rather go to Israel than stay home
49:28 -  and give ourselves to that kind of struggle and requirement so I often say
49:34 -  you can as much offend against God and be opposed to the ultimate
49:40 -  fulfillment of his mystery by having a shallow and sentimental affinity for present Israel
49:46 -  as much as being anti-Semitic and totally opposed and indifferent to the destiny of Jews all together
49:52 -  there's only one posture and one call for us that's valid is Paul's apostolic
49:58 -  apprehension of the mystery and its fulfillment through us
50:04 -  that we should not be ignorant or wise in our own conceit blindness in part has happened to Israel
50:10 -  until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in
50:16 -  Israel will not be saved by any conduct of its own why is that that they've got to be reduced to
50:28 -  dry bones where they themselves say we are cut off we are not
50:34 -  because Israel and the Jew are the archetypal paradigm
50:42 -  of human sufficiency of man in his own ability
50:48 -  to do and to perform they cannot succeed on that basis
50:54 -  Israel's destiny is not to exalt itself as a nation but to glorify its God
51:00 -  who raises them from the dead this is an issue of humanism God is making a demonstration
51:08 -  of a witness nation and showing that though they have such prominence and such ability
51:14 -  and cleverness and prowess and military ability and finance so as to take a dead
51:20 -  nation or malarial swamp and in a half century make it a modern high tech civilization
51:26 -  they cannot succeed on the basis of their merit nor their ability for in man is no good thing
51:34 -  at all he's using Israel as a text case to show the world
51:40 -  that his presumption that man can succeed independent of God is the most vicious lie
51:46 -  and contrary to the grace that he would extend to all those who acknowledge that in themselves
51:52 -  there is no good thing at all you've got to understand the magnitude of this drama and what
51:58 -  is at stake here and why Israel must necessarily fail why there must necessarily
52:04 -  be an expulsion and an uprooting why the return must be totally supernatural
52:10 -  and be the evidence of his mercy through the church because they don't deserve it
52:16 -  and what did we deserve by which salvation has come to us what because you were clever
52:22 -  you were nice you had well meaning intentions you never hurt anybody you were moral and God needed you
52:28 -  it's exactly the same mercy that has come to us and if we don't recognize that
52:34 -  that we had no qualification no deserving for our own salvation and that what has come to us that we are
52:40 -  enjoying by the grace of God without our own merit how shall we extend
52:46 -  mercy because Paul says that by your mercy they might obtain mercy
52:52 -  and if you have no mercy to give what shall you extend
52:58 -  so here's a requirement to move from the level of doctrine
53:04 -  and what's the word about
53:10 -  articles of belief creed from creedal faith to existential appropriation
53:16 -  of the mercy of which we need to be conscious and celebrate
53:22 -  or else we'll have nothing to give let me ask you have you got a face to show the Jews in the last days
53:28 -  that can love them unconditionally despite their mean spirited ingratitude
53:34 -  at the cost of your hospitality to them by which you'll be risking your life
53:40 -  because they will be hounded by such vile Islamic forces that will not be satisfied
53:46 -  with anything less than their death how will they treat you if they learn that you have socketed
53:52 -  these Jews whom they hate and want to annihilate you'll likely suffer the same fate
53:58 -  with the Jew and your willingness to do so and count it a privilege
54:04 -  is the demonstration of another wisdom how these mysteries come together
54:10 -  you'll be faithful to be what you ought in its fulfillment
54:16 -  the heart of what is apostolic is the glory of God forever
54:22 -  that's why it's got to be through him that it might be through him
54:28 -  it's not our well-meaning intention our religious obligation if we show them only a Chinese face
54:34 -  a religious obligation, we have failed we've got to show them the face of their God
54:40 -  how do you know God lives? I'm tired of this God talk well she said without hesitating a moment lifting up that little snub
54:46 -  gentile face to me I know that God lives on, He lives in me boom, down I went
54:52 -  knocked out, out flat I thought when I recovered what hit me?
54:58 -  what did she say? it wasn't even intellectual it wasn't spiritual
55:04 -  but it was true and that little snub face proved it
55:10 -  there was a light in that face it was the light that lightens the gentiles and is the glory of the people of Israel
55:16 -  and I didn't know there was the glory of the people of Israel until I saw the light in the face of a gentile unless we see it there
55:22 -  they will not see it at all you've got to reveal it and it's going to take more than the face
55:28 -  of self-conscious religious obligation it's going to require the face of deeply sanctified
55:34 -  saints who counted a privilege to suffer for the redemption of Israel
55:40 -  for it's the coming of their king and his kingdom and his glory forever how are you going to come to that sanctification?
55:46 -  how are you going to come to that deep inward working by which you're not easily offended
55:52 -  if somebody looks at you the wrong way and is mean-spirited and is ungrateful
55:58 -  which now can easily offend you you're offended by Christians what will you do with these Jews?
56:04 -  take a deep breath something authentic has got to be wrought in you
56:12 -  there's only one place where that operation and sanctification is affected
56:18 -  it's in the church, that is in the church unto him be glory in the church, world without
56:24 -  end throughout all ages which is more than the conglomerate of casual saints
56:30 -  sharing an auditorium that's where the working takes place the rubbing, the grip
56:36 -  the encounter, the confrontation the disappointment, the disillusionment I remember one of the earliest times
56:42 -  I spoke this message and I quoted Paul, by your mercy I felt a pain, mercy, some black lady
56:48 -  cried out in the congregation said, but brother Archie said we don't even have mercy for each other
56:56 -  I said exactly, but you know what if you had not been faced by the crisis that's before you with Israel
57:02 -  you would not have recognized the truth of your present condition and you would have lived like that
57:08 -  and not dealt with the absence of mercy, but now you're compelled to see to it with each other
57:14 -  that you might see to it for them in their coming mustn't be guilty of moral cowardice
57:20 -  just being a casual conglomerate of those who share a room for the purpose of a service
57:26 -  we're in something together we need to take those Chinese masks off
57:32 -  of civility, decorum, privacy keep your distance of my respect, my face
57:38 -  my prestige that's got to go we've got to be open
57:44 -  and beholding in each other's faces move from glory to glory in the knowledge
57:50 -  of the face of God and reflect that face that when they see it in your face
57:56 -  how devastated those Jews will be they never expected to see in your face
58:02 -  the glory of the people of Israel but your light is invincible
58:08 -  and it's not artificial it's authentic, it's ingrained it's wrought
58:14 -  it's consistent you're exhibiting the life of their God and that's exactly what
58:20 -  moves them to jealousy who ever expected to find it in Gentiles
58:26 -  and of all Gentiles Chinese to find it there
58:32 -  is to find the glory of God that's the Mystery Saints and it's so exquisite
58:38 -  so in the heart of God that he does not think it extravagant to uproot Jews
58:44 -  from Toronto or San Francisco or Hawaii or wherever they are or New York or Brooklyn
58:50 -  and bring them to Malaysia through cargo ships through Chinese container
58:56 -  cargo ships that I saw at the Panama Canal just barely with two feet of water on each side
59:02 -  stacked high with containers and I thought, how long will it be
59:08 -  before Jews will be moved like merchandise in container compartments that have been ventilated
59:14 -  through Chinese ships moving from Asia to the West and West to Asia, bringing Jews
59:20 -  that they might be sifted through the nations not only for their own sake but that the nations themselves
59:26 -  will be sifted and the church within the nations it's not too extravagant for God to perform
59:32 -  this globally and he'll have three and a half years in which to do it before the surviving remnant
59:38 -  will return to Zion with everlasting joy upon their heads and mourning and sighing, fleeing away
59:44 -  can you imagine that we're at the threshold of this great saga, this symphonic
59:50 -  thing that most of the church is profoundly ignorant that it's even going to take place
59:56 -  and doesn't even desire that it should take place so people say
01:00:02 -  when is this going to happen? has God given you a time sequence? No
01:00:08 -  I think everything is ready Israel is ready to explode they're hanging on by their fingernails
01:00:14 -  they're threatened from every side, there's no way that they can resist the atomic threat
01:00:20 -  that will come through Iran or the onslaught of Palestinians outraged by the world, overflowing like a
01:00:26 -  great tsunami into Israel and coming into their cities to slay to rape, to loot and to destroy
01:00:32 -  that when the Lord comes in Zechariah two thirds have already perished the women have been ravaged
01:00:38 -  that's ready to break what holds it back? the church is not yet prepared
01:00:44 -  to receive them in flight because God said when I
01:00:50 -  my foot stepped over the chain of that bankrupt voice camp that they asked me to visit just as a
01:00:56 -  lark in a novelty speaking a speaker in northern Minnesota the moment my foot came down
01:01:02 -  on the ground the Lord said dominion, end time teaching center
01:01:08 -  community refuge so for 32 years we have been
01:01:14 -  laboring and sacrificing not a place anyone would choose to establish a
01:01:20 -  community as a refuge but I'll tell you this saints if you're not a community you'll not be a
01:01:26 -  refuge it's going to take the corporate tested strength and character in life
01:01:32 -  of the people who dwell together and have worked through their own issues in order to be able to
01:01:38 -  absorb the impact and the shock of Jews coming to them in their untoward condition
01:01:44 -  a community must proceed a place of refuge and a community is not some kind of novel
01:01:50 -  alternative to the church community is definitively what God intends church to be
01:01:56 -  those who believe were together see the crisis of Israel compels
01:02:02 -  us to be the church gives us the incentive to be the bride while at the same
01:02:08 -  time we are the factor for Israel's redemption and return and survival
01:02:14 -  all the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God
01:02:20 -  when have you said oh last when have you gasped when have you doubled over when have you sensed the symphonic
01:02:26 -  proportions of this great mystery because once having been touched by it you'll be symphonic
01:02:32 -  whether it's the issue of Jews or not in fact you'll be more effectual to the Gentile because
01:02:38 -  of it because you've gone to the Jew first you'll be effectual to the Greek later
01:02:44 -  there's a mystery even in the divine ordering of God starting with what is most difficult
01:02:50 -  which we have circumvented and avoided in our cowardice
01:02:56 -  sensing that the Jews are tough and that we don't have what it takes and that our spirituality will not
01:03:02 -  be sufficient to meet the challenge of their unbelief to the Jew
01:03:08 -  first and also to the Greek we have paid a price for our neglect of
01:03:14 -  God's divine mandate and ordering and the principalities and the powers of the air
01:03:20 -  who look down upon us and hear our choruses and lord lord this and lord that and lord lord
01:03:26 -  they say baloney because if he were lord he would have gone to the
01:03:32 -  Jew first and also to the Greek but in ignoring that requirement and that divine ordering and
01:03:38 -  mandate you give a clear evidence that he's a lord only verbally but not in fact
01:03:44 -  the issue of the Jew is the issue of the church the issue of the church is the issue of their salvation and their redemption
01:03:50 -  and the whole thing is the issue of God's glory forever
01:03:56 -  so when the fullness of the Gentiles become in you will have transcended your cultural and ethnic
01:04:02 -  origins you'll be full of hybraic sap
01:04:08 -  you'll be full of the Psalms and the prophets your mentality will be prophetic and apostolic
01:04:14 -  and you will have come to a fullness that is more than the issue of number though the issue of number is not
01:04:20 -  insignificant either because we're called to replace all of the fallen angels who today
01:04:26 -  constitute the principalities and powers of the air there's a fullness that must come in
01:04:32 -  so you have an incentive for your world evangelism for the local community to see that every soul has
01:04:38 -  opportunity to be saved so that the fullness can come in for Israel is the ultimate incentive
01:04:44 -  for the fulfillment of our evangelistic and mission purposes in the earth
01:04:50 -  for there that fullness releases the deliver to come out of Zion and take transgression from Jacob
01:04:56 -  according to my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins
01:05:02 -  in verse 27 because all Israel shall be saved as it is written
01:05:08 -  listen dear saints what kind of a church are we that is not concerned for the fulfillment
01:05:14 -  of what is written and the covenant which he has made with them for if he fails
01:05:20 -  to fulfill what is written and cannot fulfill the covenant with them despite
01:05:26 -  their condition how is he God the issue of Israel's redemption
01:05:32 -  is the issue of God forever whether his praises
01:05:38 -  might ring forth from one coast to the other from one end of the earth to the other and the
01:05:44 -  recognition of what God is as he has revealed himself and his mercy
01:05:50 -  toward Israel through the church so they are the enemies
01:05:56 -  of the gospel for your sake you need that enemy you need that opposition you need that challenge because you're
01:06:02 -  resting on your haunches you've got it too easy you're going to places where you're likely to be more
01:06:08 -  received than if you confronted a Jew but the gifts and callings of God are without repentance
01:06:14 -  for in times past that you have not believed God you have now obtained mercy through their unbelief
01:06:20 -  even so these also now have not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
01:06:26 -  when Moses asked God show me your glory he showed him his
01:06:32 -  mercy for God's mercy is his glory and it concludes the whole redemptive drama
01:06:38 -  of mankind by the exhibition of his mercy to those who don't
01:06:44 -  deserve mercy but receive it because it's not the issue of the deserving it's the issue
01:06:50 -  of what he is in himself because you have obtained mercy God is going to call you
01:06:56 -  to extend mercy and where will the Jew ever need mercy more than in the last days of the time
01:07:02 -  of Jacob's trouble when they are hounded and pursued unto death in all nations by the Islamic
01:07:08 -  presence that had now proliferated the entire world and is lying low waiting for the
01:07:14 -  signal to ravage to tear and to destroy for God has concluded
01:07:20 -  them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all oh the deaths of the riches
01:07:26 -  both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable his judgments his ways best
01:07:32 -  finding out who's been his who has known the mind of the Lord who has been his counsel who's going to instruct God
01:07:38 -  who has first given to him it shall be recompense unto him again for of him
01:07:44 -  and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever Lord
01:07:50 -  I'm asking mercy tonight and this people need mercy

01:08:02 -  intended to be transforming for the church transfiguring provide a candidate
01:08:10 -  a bride for the bridegroom so we're asking the mercy of retention
01:08:16 -  that nothing shall fall to the ground that we'll deliberate over this it'll haunt us in the night hours
01:08:24 -  we'll open up the Bible we'll read again Romans 11 will ponder reflect on what was said
01:08:30 -  we'll take it deeply into our spirit we'll be willing to become a community that we might become
01:08:36 -  a refuge whatever the sacrifice and cost and it will require something will be
01:08:42 -  set in motion because of tonight that is historic as it will affect all the future
01:08:48 -  for which we need mercy for its fulfillment if I need mercy to communicate
01:08:54 -  and if I need mercy to hear what will you require to fulfill so my God
