The Abrahamic Faith (1 of 2)

00:00 -  The opportunity to look at Genesis 15, it's remarkable how terse, T-E-R-S-E, the scriptures are. of how much can be said in so few words, just contrary to the whole spirit of the world,
00:31 -  whose mouth is always running off, and that the volume of the world speaking far exceeds its content. So, here's one episode in the life of Abraham, but it's a critical episode.
00:47 -  Maybe we can say that everything that has taken place with Abraham from Genesis chapter 12 was preparation for what is going to be performed in 15, and everything that follows is the result of it.
01:03 -  And if that's not true, I think it is true that it's a good way to perceive things. Everything till now has been preparation, everything from now, issues from this moment, has its significance because of it.
01:22 -  I've never quite seen it or said that like that before, but it's a good way to perceive reality itself. Have you ever said that?
01:31 -  Everything till now has been preparation, and there's a certain significance to now as it will affect all the future. What a wonderful way to perceive life.
01:42 -  Well, Abraham has just come back from a victory over the kings of Sodom. He has rescued his nephew Lot and has refused the reward that was offered him by the earthly king.
02:02 -  It says in chapter 14, verse 22, I have sworn to the Lord God, most high possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread or a sandal, thong or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abraham rich.
02:19 -  Oh, how can you not help but love this man? These are not puppets or automatons, mechanical pieces of humanity, and God is merely moving chess pieces on a board.
02:32 -  These are flesh and blood men, and of whom the world is not worthy. And it says, the eye of God rose to and fro over the face of the earth, seeking the heart of that one, to reveal himself to that one whose heart is turned toward him, shows that
02:49 -  though God is sovereign, there is a profound, immeasurably profound place for human freedom and response toward God. In fact, I would say the freedom to respond to God is the essential freedom that makes
03:08 -  man man. This is the heart of what is at our humanity. We're not automatons, we're not puppets, we're not being jerked.
03:18 -  There's not a God who is working out his spectacular will despite us. It's a God who is so great, he's working out a spectacular will through us in a freedom in which we yield to his will and give ourselves.
03:37 -  So it's a remarkable drama. And Abraham was called. He could have turned a deaf ear to that call.
03:47 -  I can remember one instance to my eternal embarrassment, I was very young in the faith, only months old, washing the dishes in my little one room apartment in Oakland, California, having just come back from the trip in which I had found the Lord, and a voice said,
04:03 -  Arthur, and I kept doing the dishes, and a few moments later, Arthur, and I kept doing the dishes, and I never turned to ask, I just could not believe, I had not the faith yet to believe that I was being addressed by God.
04:22 -  Just to recover myself, there have been other episodes since where the Lord has been, his voice has been yet more still and small, and I have heard and turned and asked. So the whole of our faith begins with God's call to a man, Abraham.
04:39 -  And if we had the time and could go back and see the origin of that call and how it comes right on the heels of the colossal rebellion of nations in Genesis 10 who were moving eastward at their own volition and seeking to establish themselves and to raise their
04:59 -  tower of Babel and to reach into the heavens, it has all of the elements that constitutes the last days world system, the unification, the ecumenical, political, religious combination of men who want to be as God.
05:18 -  What was at the beginning will be also at the end, and God brought that attempt down by confusing languages and dispersing them over the earth, as you will also bring the last days rebellion down as well.
05:31 -  And then the call to Abraham. The nations have failed, they've rebelled against God, they refuse to recognize his program, his plan, and then God establishes his plan by the call of one man who becomes
05:50 -  the father of faith, the father of Israel, and the nation central to all nations. Isn't that remarkable? God's whole program, his whole theocratic design for creation comes with the call to
06:07 -  one man. Resting on the ability of a man to hear God's voice in, so to speak, Babylon, in Chaldea, in Ur, you are the city where Abraham lived, in the midst of all of the idols and everything
06:28 -  that was anti-God, one man heard his voice and was called out and came. He hesitated, he delayed, there was a significant delay, I was almost going to say I'm happy for that, only in the sense I'm never happy for any disobedience to God, and procrastination
06:47 -  is disobedience. When chapter 12 begins, and let's take a look at that. So Abraham departed, as the Lord had spoken in verse 4, but it's much later than when
07:09 -  God's first call came, because the Lord had said to Abram, get thee out of your country and from your kindred in your father's house, but we know that when he did go, it was not from Ur of the Chaldeans, but from Haran, which word means delay, and that instead of
07:28 -  leaving his father's house, he took his father with him, instead of leaving his kindred, he took his mishpacha, he took water. So in a word, it's a disappointment and it's an encouragement.
07:42 -  We would love to have seen pure obedience to God in the moment of his call. What we see is delay and a mixed obedience. He couldn't bring himself to a whole, forthcoming out, he lingered.
07:58 -  In fact, Haran is alongside the same river where Ur of the Chaldeans was. You need to understand the power of rivers in the Fertile Crescent and the river civilizations of Mesopotamia, everything, not just economy but culture, rested on river.
08:16 -  They were river civilizations, their commerce, their trade, their significance, everything rested on the flow of rivers, but when you come into the land, there's no river of any significance at all.
08:30 -  You say, what about Jordan? Enormously significant spiritually, but in terms of being a Nile or a Tigris or a Euphrates, whose rise and fall and fluvia, what do you call it, that brings the prime soil, zero.
08:48 -  When you come into the land, you don't look down at rivers for your economic well-being. You look up to heaven, from whence cometh the early rain and the latter rain. And even that is not just a matter of fixed rhythm of nature, but in response and obedience
09:05 -  to the God of heaven who sends it and will withhold it in disobedience. See, the whole economy, the whole order of things profoundly changes when you cross over and come into the land.
09:21 -  The word Hebrew, Abraham is a Gentile by birth, just to encourage you guys around the table here. He became a Hebrew, just like you, by crossing over. And that's the very root of the meaning of the word Hebrew, one who crosses over.
09:41 -  And what a crossing over that is. You leave everything behind you, the whole pattern of life. And I think from all that scholars have been able to establish,
09:52 -  it wasn't as if Abraham was a man who had not much to lose. He had everything to lose. He was a man of substantial possession.
10:03 -  And they say that the homes of men of his class at his time was not lacking in anything that would bless people of solid middle-class stature today. Hot and cold running water, and maids and servants and all of the kinds of things
10:19 -  that one would be loathe to leave behind. And I can't think of a more profound description of the cross than to leave nation, kindred, and father's house and follow me in the land that I will show you.
10:37 -  Tremulous, uncertain, fearful, insecure. To follow some nebulous God in a life, in a civilization that believed in many Gods. Who's this one now who speaks and says, follow me?
10:54 -  This is the living God. This is the true God. And follow me in the land that I will show you. It requires an active, dynamic faith.
11:06 -  Everything is open and requires an intimacy and being cast upon God, independency, moment by moment, day by day, the land that I will show you. The call to Abraham is the cross.
11:22 -  Everything that's dear to men and their flesh, nation, kindred, and father's house. God says, get thee out. He says, don't linger. Don't be partial.
11:36 -  All this in heaven to get thee out. It's the most radical call to separation. It's nothing less than the cross.
11:46 -  And the fact that Abraham could not bring himself to that totality and that he delays in the place in Haran and the delay was so long that it says they gathered many souls there and much substance.
11:57 -  It wasn't some overnight delay. It may have well have been a matter of years. In fact, what finally releases Abraham to be obedient to God's call
12:06 -  is the death of his father, Terah, T-E-R-A-H, I think it is. Isn't it interesting how death is the key to life? In the day that I saw the Lord, it was when King Uzziah died.
12:22 -  I've always wondered what's in Isaiah 6. Is that a mere piece of chronological coincidence or a significant release for Isaiah?
12:34 -  In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord high and lifted up. In the day that Abraham's father died, Abraham departed as his Lord had spoken unto him.
12:47 -  And this is the father of faith, saints, and I love it. You know why? Because he's no tin saint.
12:53 -  He's flesh and blood like his way. He hesitates, he delays, he's a mixed bag. He hears, but he doesn't hear.
13:01 -  He comes, but he doesn't come. He drags his feet, he lingers, but he finally does come. And so the patience of God to show us that...
13:11 -  I'm not putting before you a model who's so lofty and so mystical, God's man of faith and power, that you couldn't ever hope to attain to his spirituality.
13:22 -  I'm showing you he's flesh and blood just as you. And I'll bring you as I brought him. And we all know that his righteousness was not some intrinsic virtue
13:36 -  that he possessed, but was imputed to him because of his faith. And we're going to examine that in just a moment. So there's a long investment of God in Abram before Chapter 15.
13:51 -  God's covenantal call to Abram is already in Chapter 12. You'll bless all the nations of the earth, all the families of the earth. The significance of what you're about to me is universal.
14:07 -  All nations will be affected by your obedience. How would you like that call? As a matter of fact, if you have not recognized Abraham's call as your call,
14:20 -  you're out of the faith. That is your call. And all nations will be affected by your obedience to it.
14:33 -  Hallelujah. So God has given Abram lavish promise in you. All the families of the earth shall be blessed.
14:53 -  I will make you a great nation. Out of your progeny, out of your loins, out of your seed, all nations, all families of the earth will be blessed.
15:12 -  Okay, so after these things, all of our little introduction are these things that have preceded what is now going to take place. After these things, and those things must proceed, there's a preparation.
15:27 -  Then there comes a moment, and it's that significant moment. We want now to examine, because it has implications for all generations, particularly for the end, and for the nation Israel that will spring out of Abram's loins.
15:43 -  After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying, isn't it remarkable everything is predicated upon the word? It began with the word Abram, Abraham, Abraham.
15:59 -  Abraham comes later, when God is the chen. That was not there originally, which some commentators say was the very breath of God. He breathed into Abraham one syllable more.
16:14 -  That was the difference between Abram and Abraham, father of many nations. So it comes by the word. What is the word that came to him in a vision?
16:26 -  I'm going to read to you from this remarkable commentary by Cael and Dilich. I think Dilich is a Hebrew Christian commentator of the 19th century. It may well be a proof of what our mother in Israel, Marie, has told me frequently.
16:48 -  She said, there's something given to you Jewish believers that's unique and is not to be expected in those that are not Jewish, namely an insight into the word of God and an ability in the proclaiming of it
17:00 -  that is reserved for you alone. I hope it doesn't sound vain. It's just confirmed by Toll and says,
17:08 -  how much more when you shall be grafted back into your own root? And you'll see that when I read from this man. Just like David Barron and the other great Hebrew Christian commentators,
17:19 -  it is superb how he interprets this chapter. But first we'll see how stupefying this chapter is, how it defies interpretation and what he makes of just this one beginning
17:33 -  that the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision. Not a dream, probably a daytime experience, something like what happened to Peter when he had that vision in Joppa
17:47 -  of the veil that came down before him. But it raises interesting questions. God could have appeared to him in fact.
17:56 -  But no, this comes in a vision and there's a reason for everything. And when do you hear the reason that this commentator gives? But first you need to try and supply your own.
18:07 -  Don't ever turn directly to a commentary. First wrestle through yourself with as much as you're able yourself to draw from the text. Read other versions of the same text, ponder, weigh it in your spirit.
18:24 -  And then after you've exhausted everything in your own contemplations, meditation, then turn to see what God has given as insight to other gifted men. That's what we will do.
18:36 -  Okay, what is the word? Do not fear Abraham. Isn't that interesting?
18:39 -  We're so preoccupied. I don't know of any previous prophetical school where the subject of fear had greater prominence than this one. Maybe because we're in a more serious hour than previous schools
18:52 -  and we're about something of greater significance and the enemy is raising up his specter and harassments. But that there's been a real question of fear that has come up in our discussion and prayer and that the first thing that God says to Abraham, do not fear Abraham.
19:10 -  It's not a suggestion, it's a commandment. And maybe the only antidote to fear is the word of God. Because he says we should not, we don't.
19:25 -  Though we may have every reason otherwise to fear. He says so. So what do we do after that?
19:31 -  The Lord has spoken. I think there's a great wisdom in that. Or else we would continually justify our fears.
19:40 -  As if it's a luxury that we are free to indulge. God says it has nothing to do with circumstance or the opposition of the enemy or any kind of dread thing of last day's turmoil.
19:52 -  We're going to come through this final hour of tribulation and things that shall come upon the earth and men's hearts will fail them for fear. But for us, do not be afraid.
20:04 -  Why? Because I say so. Okay, Lord. I am a shield to you.
20:12 -  He's not just speaking to Abraham. He's speaking to the man who is the father of faith and it's the appropriate word for the seed of Abraham,
20:19 -  the children of faith in every generation, especially the last. I am a shield to you. I'll give you a white shadow.
20:26 -  Nothing can touch you. You're under a halo. The powers of the darkness can foam at the mouth
20:33 -  and be perplexed and relish your destruction. They cannot touch you. Not a hair on your head, unless I allow it.
20:41 -  Remember what Jesus said to Pontius Pilate? He was this helpless piece of humanity. He'd already been knocked from pillar to post.
20:48 -  He was full of bruises and cuts and blood and up all the night between... He was in the house of Caiaphas
20:59 -  and now finally brought before this Roman authority. He was supposed to buckle and sag and plead for his earthly existence.
21:08 -  And he was just perfectly calm and unperturbed, imperturbable and ponderful. Don't you know that I have the power
21:16 -  either to destroy you or to release you? You could do nothing against me except if we're given you from above.
21:27 -  Oh, hallelujah. Dear saints, we ought to walk through this world not in some kind of arrogance
21:33 -  but certainly not coward with fear or intimidation but as men and women who are under the divine protection of the same God who protected Abraham
21:43 -  and protects all the children of Abraham in every generation. What God allows is modest, allows.
21:50 -  And when we turn to Revelation 13-7 and it was given to him, the Antichrist, to make war against the saints and to overcome them.
21:58 -  What? God allowed his own choice, saints of whom the world is not worthy,
22:03 -  to suffer and to die at the hands of Antichrist? Yes. It is serving an ultimate purpose.
22:10 -  But it is not the outworking of the powers of darkness in their own ability. It was given unto him.
22:18 -  Right. Yes. Nothing except to come down from above. That's a precious confidence.
22:28 -  And I don't think it will come down until the purposes for our being have been fulfilled. Let's say, David served his generation and fell asleep.
22:40 -  I occasionally pray that, Lord, let me serve my generation in the same Davidic heart and purity and fullness
22:51 -  and then let me fall asleep. But let nothing remain undone or unattended that you haven't designed and intended for me.
22:59 -  However small, whatever little place in your vineyard, let the full outworking of it be performed and then take me.
23:07 -  However, it doesn't matter. Be confident of that. I am a shield to you.
23:17 -  Your reward shall be very great. Boy, I tell you, if there's ever any three statements, three sentences that are appropriate
23:23 -  for saints of the last days who are the seed of Abraham, it is these three.
23:30 -  Just to encourage your hearts, I have not rehearsed any of this. I didn't think to myself,
23:36 -  well, first I'll take apart the statement and then nothing. It's just happening.
23:43 -  This is what God is wanting us to seem to understand. This is not just a moment in history that came to man in a vision.
23:50 -  This is the timeless and eternal counsel of God for the seed of Abraham in all generations and especially the last.
23:56 -  Three great statements. Don't be afraid. I'm a shield to you.
24:03 -  Boy, if you've got a shield like that, what can penetrate it? And your reward shall be very great.
24:12 -  Hallelujah. I'm always inviting people to my mansion in heaven. I have not seen, you have not heard,
24:22 -  and I'm not a glutton for voluptuous luxury, but there's a treasure being laid up. There's reward, there's honor of an eternal kind.
24:32 -  We will say, it was worth it all. Every privation, every humiliation, every rebuke, every unjust act toward us,
24:39 -  every physical suffering, there's a reward, a very great reward. And the peculiar nature of the Church is,
24:50 -  unlike any other entity in the world, it is a people who can give themselves full bore in total consecration and commitment
25:00 -  in giving this to God now in anticipation of reward that comes to them. There's nothing like that in the world.
25:07 -  The world always has to give its reward now. Fame, fortune, your name, your reputation. You'll do this, you'll get this,
25:15 -  you'll be on the Riviera, you'll get a car, you'll be a girl's man. Now, this is the now generation
25:21 -  wants its gratification now. Unlike that, only the Church, the true Church, can serve God totally without any anticipation
25:31 -  of its compensation coming now. Its great reward comes after. But it will come because God has spoken.
25:42 -  And rewards are not something to be disregarded. I didn't watch any bit of it, but we just have finished with the Olympics,
25:53 -  and boy, did you read the preparations these athletes go through? I mean, it makes the generation of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin
26:02 -  look like a Boy Scout outing. This is scientific. This is almost occultic,
26:08 -  how they prepare not only the bodies, but the minds of these athletes and their inward attitudes and what they believe,
26:14 -  and they get them all revved up, and the exercises, the diets, they have counselors that are professional
26:20 -  just for their morale. And they shave their heads, and they've got costumes now
26:26 -  that are made out of the most sophisticated fabrics and they shave off one thousandth millimeter of a fraction of a second,
26:34 -  which is the difference between victory and defeat. You cannot believe what is invested in running the race,
26:42 -  in obtaining the earthly reward, and what they're going to get now in millions in endorsements of products.
26:48 -  This girl who got four gold medals in swimming, and she's already a culture hero, and she's going to endorse this product and that product
26:55 -  in swimming suits and bathing caps and toothpaste and she'll have a fortune before she's twenty-five. That's the name of the game,
27:03 -  that they give themselves for the reward now, and will all fade away and turn to dust. Our reward is eternal and abiding.
27:17 -  So, and Abram said, Oh Lord God, what will thou give me since I am childless,
27:25 -  and the heir of my house is Eleazar of Damascus. Abram said, Since thou hast given no offspring to me,
27:33 -  one born in my house is my heir. Do you understand what is on Abram's heart? Lord, you're making all these lavish promises,
27:40 -  I'm going to be the father of many nations, but where's my progeny? It's got to come from my body.
27:48 -  Where's the son of promise that you've said you're going to give me? I'm barren, I'm living with a woman
27:54 -  who's never had any children, and I'm getting up there in years. And if you don't provide an offspring,
28:02 -  this Eleazar, according to the understanding of that time and generation, he will become the descendant.
28:12 -  Now what would you say, that this reveals something selfish in Abram? That he wants the honor and distinction
28:20 -  of himself giving forth the son that inherits these things? Is he jealous for himself?
28:27 -  No. Yeah. He's really asking the things
28:33 -  that pertain to God's own glory. How can you make these lavish promises to me, and I don't see any yet possible fulfillment,
28:42 -  and the hope for it is fast fading away. If that's not the heart and essence of what it means to live in faith,
28:51 -  I don't know what it means. Haven't you experienced that? A sense of futility, if not desperation,
28:58 -  and where is God, and where is the fulfillment of the very thing that he led you to expect? And the disappointment that comes.
29:07 -  So this is a classic episode of situation. Thou hast given me no offspring. I have to say this for Abram,
29:14 -  he knows where offspring comes from. Thou hast given me no offspring. And if offspring comes, thou givest it.
29:22 -  Because it doesn't come because I'm able to copulate and perform biologically and spermatozoa with the eggs and the blah blah blah.
29:33 -  No, thou givest. Here's a man who knows the heart of cause and effect. It has not to do with nature,
29:45 -  that's only God's apparatus. It has to do with the God who gives. Thou hast not given.
29:53 -  And if you don't give, it doesn't come. And I'm not looking for it from any other source. I'm not going to take vitamins and become fertile
30:03 -  and do yoga and... It's got to come from you. Can you see why God loves Abram?
30:12 -  And he saw that heart when Abram was in the oar of the Chaldees in the midst of idolatry. He saw the heart of that man.
30:19 -  His eye rose to and forth over the face of the earth seeking that one whose heart is perfect toward him. The fact that there's only one manner of speaking,
30:30 -  so few out of the heart proceed the issues of life. And that heart is revealed by Abram, even in his question, even in his understanding.
30:40 -  Thou hast not given. Then, behold, the word of the Lord came to him not to upbraid him, not to rebuke him,
30:50 -  not to say, you're way off the wall. He agrees with him. He understands Abram's framework of thinking and expectancy.
30:58 -  It's perfectly legitimate and says, this man will not be your heir, but one who shall come forth from your own body,
31:06 -  he shall be your heir. And he took him outside and said, now look toward the heavens and count the stars
31:13 -  if you're able to count them. And he said to him, so shall your descendants be. He's talking to a man who's pushing a hundred
31:23 -  past any biological age of being capable of producing children with a wife that has been barren all her life long.
31:34 -  What does it say in Romans? Abraham hoped against hope. When all basis for human hope was gone,
31:42 -  Abraham continued to hope against hope. Looking upon his body, now as good as dead, Abraham hoped against hope.
31:54 -  Was it just a circumstance that he had a wife who was barren? No. The superb details of God,
32:05 -  that the whole Abrahamic faith has to have its origin out of human hopelessness, no confidence in the flesh at all.
32:21 -  In all that is barren, weak, despairing, all the more heightened by the lavish promises that God gives, that you will bless all the families of the earth,
32:37 -  that makes you all the more conscious of your frailty, of your inadequacy, of your terrible humanity and emptiness. We wouldn't be so conscious of it if we had not so great a call.
32:51 -  So there's the conjunction of the great call with our body as good as dead. That is the very nexus of the way of God in the earth
33:07 -  and God's answer to the rebellion of nations described in Genesis 10 who wanted to make a name for themselves in such haste that they burned their brick,
33:19 -  they baked it in fire because they couldn't wait for the sun to dry it, so impatient to make a ziggurat, a Babylonian tower into the heavens
33:31 -  to study the stars for occultic reasons and to defy God and to supersede God and to be his God. To counteract all that and to show his intention for nations,
33:42 -  God fingers one man and gives him a wife who is barren and gives him lavish promises and waits till there's beyond any hope that they can be fulfilled out of his own humanity.
33:56 -  Then by the faith of the man, according to what God has spoken, begins the setting in motion, the fulfillment. And we're going to talk about what Abrahamic faith is.
34:13 -  Oh, my glasses are getting steamed up. Okay. So God is promising, takes him outside to see the stars.
34:29 -  So shall your descendants be. Not just the scraggly one or two, but the great abundance. By the way, I had to say, however much I missed my sleep last night
34:42 -  and having to pick Peter up and get to bed about one and finally park the car after we got his luggage out, I just happened to look up and what a sky.
34:51 -  I was seeing the sky. Did anyone take a glimpse? Yes. Awesome. It was awesome.
34:57 -  The constellations, not just the brilliance of individual stars, there's like a milky way. There's a whitish haze and it's fixed, it doesn't move.
35:09 -  In fact, we saw a falling star on the way from the airport. My jaw dropped. I said, look, thank you for the privilege of looking up at the sky. I've forgotten the magnificence of it.
35:22 -  So we have to be taken out of our tent and be told, look up. And I don't know how many times have I been depressed, weighted down, feeling hopeless and futile,
35:32 -  and Lord, what are we doing here? And this is nothing and we're just knocking about and nothing seems to succeed and we're dragging
35:39 -  and we're lacking in this and that. We're all finances and look up. What does it say in Genesis 1, God made the heaven and the earth
35:50 -  and he made the stars also. Like a little after point. Oh, by the way, not only the heavens and the earth
35:58 -  and all that in them is, but he made the stars also. That's why God will hold every man accountable for the failure to acknowledge him,
36:11 -  for his reality is written in his creation. Then he believed in the Lord, verse 6. What do we imply?
36:26 -  Maybe he didn't quite believe till then. When you believe, when all basis for believing is gone, you really believe. And we're going to get into this in a moment.
36:41 -  He takes up the Hebrew word for faith and the etymology, the origin of the word and its Hebraic meanings staggering.
36:54 -  You just want to crawl into a hole for what we have thought the word faith means. What is implied in the great word believe.
37:02 -  It's not just ascent to a credo. It is ultimate trust and confidence in a person whose word is the statement of his character.
37:18 -  Requires a knowledge of God. And that knowledge does not come cheaply. And that's why maybe then he believed.
37:28 -  It took all that... How does this chapter begin? After these things? It took these things first.
37:34 -  To come to a place of authentic biblical Abrahamic faith. Then he believed. When all basis for hope was gone
37:45 -  and God reckoned it to him as righteousness. Have you ever dwelt on that? Is it like a reward for believing?
37:56 -  And what's the connection between righteousness and faith? And if it's reckoned or imputed, it makes clear. It's nothing that could ever have its origin in man.
38:11 -  It's the distinctive of what God himself is. In a certain sense, God imputed himself to Abraham. He gave him his life, the character, his righteousness
38:23 -  on the basis of believing. He was able to entrust him with the treasure of himself because he believed.
38:34 -  I don't even want to cheapen things by even making an allusion to the faith and prosperity quote message that had been current in our generation
38:44 -  in believing for a Cadillac. This is another dimension of Abraham. The two things should not even be mentioned in the same breath.
38:56 -  And he said to him, remember, all this is a vision. It's not an actual experience. It could have been, but it was given in a vision,
39:07 -  this conversation with God. It was born in vision. The whole Abrahamic faith and righteousness,
39:16 -  the whole genius of it comes not even in a dream or an experience or a visitation, but a vision. I am the Lord who brought you out of all the Chaldeans
39:26 -  to give you this land to possess it. Okay, you guys, your turn. Exegete God's statement.
39:38 -  Draw out its meaning. Of all the things that God could say, what does he say to Abraham?
39:48 -  I am the Lord. I am that I am. When Moses said to the God of the burning bush,
39:56 -  who shall I tell the people is sending me? I mean, who am I? I'm in exile for the murder of an Egyptian 40 years before
40:05 -  and they don't know me from beans. Tell them I'm the God of their fathers. I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
40:13 -  I'm the God of Israel. This shall be my name throughout all your generations. I am that I am.
40:21 -  I will be who I will be. God's eternal designation of himself. And that's why in John 8,
40:34 -  when Jesus is being mocked and taunted by his peers, who do you think you are? You think you're greater than the prophets?
40:42 -  You think you're greater than our father Abraham? You Johnny Come Lately? You 33 year old?
40:48 -  Or whatever he was? Well, he said, I'll tell you that before Abraham was, I am.
40:59 -  That doesn't leave you much room. You either have got to fall on your face and cry out, my Lord and my God,
41:07 -  or you have to do what they did. They took up stones to kill him. You don't take the name of the Lord to yourself,
41:14 -  except you are the Lord. Right. Before Abraham was, I am.
41:19 -  And he was glad and he saw my day. So, I am the Lord, God's first statement to Abraham,
41:31 -  who brought you out to bring you in. I didn't just take you out of a place of idolatry, but I took you out to bring you in.
41:45 -  We need to remember that. To give you this land to possess it. So, this saves us from ethereal spirituality,
42:01 -  lofty intangible promises that have only to do with eternity. This land, the specificity of God, terra firma, this piece of real estate,
42:15 -  not just to contemplate, to possess. That's the reason why I brought you out. Of course, with the land,
42:25 -  it's not just a place to grow a garden. It includes the holy hill of Zion. And out of it will come the law
42:33 -  that will bless all the families of the earth. But don't ever separate the one from the other. And you'll hear even men today say,
42:42 -  God is not interested in real estate. Israel is no more significant to God than the upstate New York, baloney.
42:51 -  This land is specific, it's given, it has everything to do with God's purposes,
43:00 -  to be enacted in time, in history, and in place. And it's a possession given to Abraham and to his seed. I've called you out that you might possess this.
43:13 -  Now we come into the mystery. And Abraham said, Oh Lord God, how may I know that I shall possess it?
43:24 -  And God does not dispute the question, but he gives a mysterious answer. Bring me a three-year-old heifer,
43:33 -  and a three-year-old female goat, and a three-year-old ram, a turtle dove, and a young pigeon. Then he brought all these to him
43:40 -  and cut them in two and laid each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds.
43:49 -  Why didn't he cut the birds? They were too small to be cut. Every item here
43:55 -  has to do with the traditional sacrifices that are later to be performed by Israel. Maybe the only thing of question is three-year-old.
44:07 -  And God is so specific in his requirement, nor does Abraham in any way question him. Why this? Why that? How come? What do you mean?
44:15 -  That's what we were saying. How come? What for? Why? He did it.
44:21 -  Abrahamic faith. Why this? Why that? How come? What do you mean? That's what we were saying. How come?
44:27 -  What for? Why? He did it. Abrahamic faith is implicit obedience
44:35 -  to what God speaks without requiring explanation. Later the explanation might come.
44:45 -  When Jesus washed the feet of the disciples and Peter demurred, Lord, not my feet.
44:51 -  If I wash not your feet, you have no part in me. And later you will understand.
44:57 -  Now you obey. Have you had that in your experience? If you haven't had, you will have.
45:03 -  Don't balk in that moment. However much it contradicts all your categories,
45:11 -  even what you think would be incompatible with God. And when you have the spirituality
45:17 -  to hear God, even when he calls you to the things that seem opposed to your understanding of him,
45:23 -  which is exactly what happens to Abraham in being called to take Isaac and make of him a sacrifice.
45:29 -  Even there, Abraham rose early. He cut the wood, stacked it,
45:35 -  took his ass and his son, and he went up. No ifs and buts, no explanations.
45:41 -  He heard the voice of the Lord. It shattered all of his categories. And it meant the removal of the Son of Promise
45:47 -  through whom all these fulfillments are to come. Seems to contradict
45:53 -  all of God's careful plan and intention. Yet he did not hesitate for a moment.
45:59 -  And I don't think he even discussed it with Sarah. She would not have understood. She would have gone hysterical.
46:05 -  He just simply rose up early in the morning. And he did it.
46:11 -  Faith is obedience, and it's prompt obedience. Without delay, without
46:17 -  procrastination, Abraham had learned his lesson in Haran. And here now,
46:25 -  perfectly obedient in what God requires. Faith is obedience.
46:35 -  So, he cut them in two. Can you picture this?
46:41 -  He went right through the middle and laid them out. Like that.
46:47 -  As if on this white line, one side, one half this side, one half that side. At least the reason is why this comes to Abraham
46:53 -  in a vision. Don't forget, nothing of this is actually being enacted. It's all in a vision. He sees himself
46:59 -  doing this in a vision. The conversation is in a vision. This is not actual event.
47:05 -  But as Delich is going to tell us, it's for that reason, more significant.
47:11 -  Can you picture that? Because it's a vision, it's all the more
47:17 -  spiritually significant than if it had taken place in fact. And I'm thinking
47:23 -  that because of Jean's remark. Maybe physically and actually, you can't cut them in a vision,
47:29 -  you can't. And it had to be done in the vision. And if it's a vision, is it less real?
47:35 -  Is it an unreality? Is it just a flighty imaginative,
47:41 -  imaginary thing? Or is it all the more real for the precision of what is being done
47:47 -  that could not have been enacted in a fact? That's why you have to come in vision.
47:53 -  But why that? It's unprecedented. It's not been this way here too far.
47:59 -  But if it was not done this way, God could not have walked between the pieces. The glory of God
48:05 -  came through the pieces to validate, ratify, and endorse this sacrifice
48:11 -  as being the answer to Abraham of how shall I inherit this land? This is how you're going to inherit it.
48:17 -  Through covenant. We will make a covenant, you and me. And we are
48:23 -  represented in the two halves. You in the one and I in the other. And I will walk between to
48:29 -  to solemnify and ratify and establish this forever. And it's on the basis of covenant
48:35 -  that this is going to be performed. Covenant
48:41 -  is exclusive, unique, unprecedented. It may have some
48:47 -  what's the word? Adumbration, some understanding even by pagan peoples
48:55 -  where they made agreements and contracts. But this has its origin in God.
49:01 -  God is the covenant making, covenant keeping God. And here we're seeing it at its very inception.
49:07 -  That there's no fulfillment to the promise of Abraham except through it. And there's no fulfillment
49:13 -  for us except through it. We are the people of the new covenant. Not new in the sense of
49:19 -  novelty. New only in the sense in the way in which the old covenants and all the covenants
49:25 -  of God speak substantially the same thing. It's new only in the way of fulfillment.
49:31 -  I will write my law in your heart and
49:37 -  I will do it. And we even see the presentiment of that here.
49:43 -  Because although covenant requires the willful agreement of two parties,
49:49 -  this is choice of ultimate radical kind. This is commitment unto death. That's why the animals are
49:55 -  cutting. There's no turning back here. There's no I'll try it on and see if it works and if it not
50:01 -  I'll see you around sometime. This is once and for all. It's absolute. It's total. It's death.
50:07 -  Death to any thought that I might have had for myself. And coming into an agreement with you God
50:13 -  on the grounds that you require it. An absolute cutting through.
50:19 -  That's why they say they cut a covenant. You don't make a covenant you cut it.
50:25 -  It's the Brit hadasha where we it's the cutting of
50:31 -  the covenant. It requires blood. As I said to someone the other day over the
50:37 -  table, if circumcision does not bring forth blood it's not valid.
50:43 -  Even in present Jewish understanding it's only then a hygienic thing. It's the blood
50:49 -  the actual cutting that establishes the authenticity.
50:55 -  And when you lay two pieces down the middle there's no chance they're going to come together again.
51:01 -  You're not going to pick up after that and try try again. It's a once and for all in utter
51:07 -  totality. And if it was not that God would not honor it.
51:13 -  If he sees any hedging, if there's something partial, something withheld
51:19 -  is not total, not absolute, not wholly given over. He has no part in that.
51:25 -  And that's why so many marriages fail. He's the third court only when the two courts
51:31 -  are authentic in their bonding and in their joining because they have cut something together and they
51:37 -  symbolize that in the ring that goes all around. Circum
51:43 -  means around. To circumvent the world is to go around the world. To circumvent the flesh is to cut it off
51:49 -  and around and entirely. Jesus was cut off and out of the land of the living by his crucifixion.
51:55 -  He was circumcised without hands. And in doing
52:01 -  that he established the new covenant. He was cut off and out.
52:07 -  And we who join him are cut off and out also from the land of the living.
52:13 -  Dalish raises the question he's looking for the symbolic significance of these animals.
52:19 -  He said, how come that they were not seven? But when you add them all up what was required here?
52:25 -  The two of each kind. The heifer, the female God, the ram, the turtle-bell young pigeon
52:31 -  and cut them in half. He said, you finally come to eight pieces. He said, and I don't see the
52:37 -  significance of eight. Seven I would have seen as completion. Don't you understand? Eight is the number
52:43 -  of resurrection. It's the number of new beginnings. That's why it's eight.
52:49 -  There's a life that comes out of this death. And it's everlasting and eternal and
52:55 -  abundant. It's on the basis of that life that we
53:01 -  are to obtain the land and to possess it. So
53:11 -  he brought all these to him in verse 10 and cut them in two and laid each half opposite the other but he did not cut the birds. They were too small.
53:17 -  They were not to be cut. And we can ask what each of these animals
53:23 -  signifies. A heifer, a goat a ram, a turtle-dove and a pigeon. They all are
53:29 -  symbolic of something and I'll read you Dalish's way of interpreting this.
53:35 -  A great Hebrew Christian scholar intimate knowledge of Hebrew.
53:43 -  And the birds of prey came in verse 11 down upon the carcasses and Abram drove them away.
53:51 -  You can imagine who the birds of prey are. And it's not that they're just
53:57 -  wanting a meal. They want to abolish. They want to exterminate. They want to remove
54:03 -  this thing before it becomes established.
54:11 -  Paul they know and Jesus they know but who are you? And wherever they see the
54:17 -  apostolic prophetic authenticity there they are to try to devour it. Just like the child
54:23 -  with the dragon, the male child that's born to the woman in the wilderness there's the dragon waiting to
54:29 -  devour it. And it says of Israel in its last days tribulation that
54:37 -  its enemies eat them up and devour them like bread. We read that the other day.
54:43 -  A remarkable graphic picture. It's not just enough to slay something.
54:49 -  You've got to devour it to remove its very existence. And Abram drove them away.
54:55 -  It says one act after laying out these parts
55:01 -  and then after that he falls into a deep sleep. So in verse 12 now when the sun was going down
55:09 -  a deep sleep fell upon Abram and behold terror and great darkness fell upon him.
55:15 -  And this is the statement in this chapter that has always intrigued me.
55:21 -  Remember we spoke about the clouds and that somehow the glory of God is shrouded in clouds and in
55:27 -  darkness. And a great darkness that came over the land when Jesus was being crucified. So that
55:33 -  Jesus' crucifixion was the circumcision made without hands. That is the
55:39 -  seal of the new covenant for all peoples. And in that cutting
55:45 -  again a darkness and great dread and terror comes over the earth.
55:51 -  What we need to ask is what is the conjunction between the establishing of
55:57 -  this enormously symbolically significant act of cutting and of
56:03 -  covenant that somehow can only be enacted together
56:09 -  with darkness, dread and terror. And I get a chill even as I say
56:15 -  that this must therefore then be the nation Israel's final experience
56:21 -  in the darkness, dread and terror of its last days tribulation comes
56:27 -  its recognition of its covenant making God and its union with him at last.
56:33 -  And there's no other way. That's the way it was with Abram in the beginning. That's the way it will be with the
56:39 -  seed of Abram at the end. And that darkness and its clouds are gathering now already.
56:45 -  For anyone to want Israel's fulfillment in the possession of the land without
56:51 -  this covenant and without the conditions of this covenant is to be dreaming.
56:57 -  It's not to reckon on God's way. I'll tell you what I think some if not much of our
57:03 -  problem is we have trivialized God. We have not understood, intruded
57:09 -  the glory of God. The things that the ineffable, that means
57:15 -  unspeakable. You can't find words to article. If God is now going to manifest his glory
57:21 -  symbolized through that smoking pot and torch that passes
57:27 -  through these parts that have been cut in two, can that come without darkness to
57:33 -  shroud it? Could Moses come up into God's presence without first being in the cloud for six days
57:39 -  and then being called up out of the thick cloud and it's not a little white
57:45 -  billowy thing. It's a fearful pulsating fire and the darkness and
57:51 -  smoke of God's glory and that Moses cannot directly just come up and say here I am. He had
57:57 -  to pass through six days a day for each aspect of his humanity six being the number of man
58:03 -  and here also now is God himself coming to solemnify and ratify a
58:09 -  covenant with man in his glory and it's got to be shrouded in darkness. God is coming to Israel.
58:15 -  God is coming into the world and he's coming in his clouds.
58:21 -  The reason that we stagger at this and don't understand the necessity for the darkness in which
58:27 -  he must be encased is we don't understand the glory. This is God. What does it say
58:33 -  in Hebrews 13 about tremble? This is not God speaking from Sinai
58:39 -  It's a consuming fire. It's a consuming fire. Fear dread. This is
58:45 -  God. Abraham had to sleep through that.
58:51 -  God is calling you to a use that involves his glory.
58:57 -  There must necessarily be a darkness that precedes it. Now it's interesting
59:03 -  to read what Delich writes and I don't know the time of that writing but it was
59:09 -  either the late 19th century or early 20th century, certainly long
59:15 -  before the Hithad time. And he says, passing through the pieces
59:21 -  he ratified the covenant which he made with Abraham. His glory was enveloped in fire and smoke
59:27 -  the product of the consuming fire both of which are symbols of the wrath of God.
59:33 -  We didn't look at verse 17 and it came about when the sun had
59:41 -  set that it was very dark and behold there appeared a smoking oven
59:47 -  and a flaming torch which passed between those pieces. It wasn't just mere dark
59:55 -  very dark and then there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch.
01:00:01 -  It sounds very much like the cloud by night and the fire by day but it symbolizes God's own presence
01:00:07 -  and his glory passing through the pieces and that's what makes the covenant the covenant.
01:00:13 -  After the conditions have been found acceptable in fact his presence passing through
01:00:19 -  the pieces is the statement of his acceptance of the sacrifice. In the same
01:00:25 -  way that when they finished the temple of Solomon and even in the very first establishment
01:00:31 -  of the tabernacle and the priesthood after the sacrifice was made something like Elijah
01:00:37 -  laying out his sacrifice the fire of God fell upon it and ignited it is the statement of God's approval
01:00:43 -  of the sacrifice. That it's not a show
01:00:49 -  of something or crippled animal or something that you're going to afford but the
01:00:55 -  best, the choice, the perfect, the complete the total. He's the total God. And if there's any
01:01:01 -  hedging, any holding back not a giving, not a full giving over unto him his fire
01:01:07 -  does not fall. So the fact that the light, the smoke
01:01:13 -  and glory, the smoke and the fire pass through the sacrifice
01:01:19 -  as a flaming torch and a smoking oven is the statement of God's acceptance of
01:01:25 -  Abraham's sacrifice and of his obedience and this commentator
01:01:31 -  says that not only ratifies the covenant but that the fire itself
01:01:37 -  is a consuming fire and a symbol of the wrath of God. A judgment
01:01:43 -  at some time. And I'm saying that this is
01:01:49 -  at the beginning with Abraham it'll be at the end with the people of Abraham and both the church
01:01:55 -  and the nation of Israel must come to its final covenant union with God
01:02:01 -  through judgment through fire, through darkness through smoke.
01:02:07 -  Compare this with the present understanding and desire of many so-called
01:02:13 -  friends of Israel that want to see the present state succeed. And just
01:02:19 -  be patient. Yeah, they're going through some problems but still straighten out and it'll be the Messianic
01:02:25 -  prophetic fulfillment without the smoke without the fire
01:02:31 -  without the judgment, without the darkness. You know what that betrays? An inadequate
01:02:37 -  knowledge of God that is bent only on the question of success and not the question of glory.
01:02:43 -  Israel's establishment is not the thing in itself it's a means to a much greater
01:02:49 -  end, the glory of God. And that glory always has to be shrouded
01:02:55 -  and to appear and to come in clouds of darkness, judgment, fire, wrath.
01:03:01 -  That God's millennial glory of a restored
01:03:07 -  earth and nations that acknowledge God comes out of the fire of his final judgment
01:03:13 -  called the time of tribulation. It begins with Israel but then it goes on to affect all nations.
01:03:19 -  So here the final birthing of the age of God, the millennial
01:03:25 -  age, comes out of great judgment, fire, darkness. Not progressive
01:03:31 -  improvement that men would like to see over a course of time
01:03:37 -  that does not require these devastating things. What a contrast between what men would like
01:03:43 -  and the way that God himself brings ushers in the thing that pertains to his glory.
01:03:49 -  Do you need a break? We ask for
01:03:55 -  continuing revelation of the rich truths, my God, that are in this chapter before us
01:04:01 -  this morning. We bless you for what you have already given and look to you, my God, to bring us to such conclusion
01:04:07 -  as should please you. Thanking you, my God, for this Saint Delich and Kiel, these two men, these scholars
01:04:13 -  who wrestled through your word, my God, and give us the advantage of their labor.
01:04:19 -  We receive it as a gift to the Church. In Yeshua's holy name. Amen. Amen.
01:04:25 -  Well, I want to give you a taste of what good exegesis is, the drawing out
01:04:31 -  the Greek word, the drawing out of the meaning of Scripture. What it means to be
01:04:37 -  a scholar in the world. What it means to be a theologian. Can you think of any more wonderful
01:04:43 -  occupation than to study the things pertaining to God? Theology?
01:04:49 -  And don't, I know Jim makes remarks about the cemetery that a seminary often is,
01:04:55 -  but don't disparage biblical learning and respect the
01:05:01 -  great gifts that the Church God has given in such men. Calvin, Luther,
01:05:07 -  I mean, much can be said in criticism as well, but giants of the faith who wrestled
01:05:13 -  with original language and text and sought the meaning of God and have enriched the Church thereby.
01:05:19 -  You'll see it now here. As, for example, the question that we took up at the beginning, why
01:05:25 -  was this given in a vision? Why not an actual act of performance? And he writes,
01:05:31 -  a vision wrought by God was not a mere fancy or subjective play of the thoughts,
01:05:37 -  but a spiritual fact, which was not only in all respects as real
01:05:43 -  as things discerned by the senses, but which surpassed it in its lasting significance.
01:05:55 -  Not only is the thought deep and precious, it is expressed felicitously.
01:06:01 -  This is felicitous language. This is where the expression matches the
01:06:07 -  content, where the thought is spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. And I'll read it
01:06:13 -  again. And you don't come to this cheaply. This is through struggle. This is through labor. This is
01:06:19 -  through effort. This is through rewriting and rewriting until you get the statement the way you want it. Some of you know what we've gone through
01:06:25 -  for a few of our newsletters when we had to come up with a statement on the Toronto blessing or even now on the time of Jacob's trouble.
01:06:31 -  How many times was it reworked and reconsidered and altered and taken into consideration the statements
01:06:37 -  until we finally felt free to publish it? Because once it's in print,
01:06:43 -  that's it. You live with that. And so I'm sure that these men passed through such labors.
01:06:49 -  So he's discussing why a vision? Is a vision mere fancy or
01:06:55 -  subjective play of thoughts? No. It's a spiritual fact, which was not only in all respects
01:07:01 -  as real as things discerned by the senses, but which surpassed it
01:07:07 -  in its lasting significance. That because it is given in vision,
01:07:13 -  it communicates something beyond and more than what would have been understood
01:07:19 -  if it had been an actual happening. That vision allows for an accuracy of
01:07:25 -  spiritual statements, like what we talked about. The cutting in half of an animal,
01:07:31 -  which probably in reality could not have been performed that way. But in the vision it was performed. In the vision,
01:07:37 -  a smoking pot and a burning torch passes through the pieces. In actuality, perhaps that would
01:07:43 -  not have been the mode. God is wanting to say something of a spiritual kind that is more
01:07:49 -  able to give through vision than he would have been through fact. That we are
01:07:55 -  open to data that goes beyond the natural senses and is as
01:08:01 -  real or more real than what the senses would confer to us. And that gives us a
01:08:07 -  source of data and input that is not available to mere earthlings who are limited
01:08:13 -  to sensual and empirical things only, things that can be seen and felt and touched.
01:08:19 -  This is the privilege of the saints by the spirit. These things are intended with a lasting
01:08:29 -  significance more so than action events that strike the eye. The covenant which Jehovah made with Abram
01:08:35 -  was not intended to give force to a mere agreement respecting mutual rights and obligations. This isn't
01:08:41 -  your little contract. I'll do this and you'll do that. A thing which
01:08:47 -  could have been accomplished by external sacrificial transaction,
01:08:53 -  but it was designed to establish the purely spiritual relation of a living
01:08:59 -  fellowship between God and Abram of the deep inward meaning of which nothing but a
01:09:05 -  spiritual intuition and experience could give to Abraham an effective
01:09:11 -  and permanent hold. I'll read that again. Look at the way I've got this. I'm showing
01:09:17 -  you how to read, how to extract, how to mock. I can't understand
01:09:23 -  that anyone could read anything worth reading without mocking it. I have got to mock it. I've got to put it
01:09:29 -  in brackets. I've got to underline. I've got to use my yellow marking pen to
01:09:35 -  catch the key words. I've got to use asterisks. That gets the meaning out. The words
01:09:43 -  for those who didn't hear this about my visit to certain saints in Germany
01:09:49 -  and I was so impressed with the quality of these saints. Only about five or six of them and they all seem to have the same quality
01:09:55 -  of spirituality. There was a depth to them and a quality of life. I said, what is it that you guys
01:10:01 -  have? Oh, they said, well, we were all brought up in the faith by the same teacher. Oh, I said, really?
01:10:07 -  Who was he? Well, it was a woman and she was a simple farm woman.
01:10:13 -  I said, what? And she laid the foundation of this impressive spirituality? Yes. What was
01:10:19 -  her key? Oh, they said, she's a woman who said that we should study
01:10:25 -  every word that proceeds from the mouth of God and we dwelt on
01:10:31 -  every word. See, we've grown up on
01:10:39 -  Gone with the Wind and novels and we read in a blur. To dwell
01:10:45 -  on every word. So, listen to this statement.
01:10:51 -  This was not some little cheapy agreement, a contract. There's a deeper
01:10:57 -  spiritual significance here that required it to be revealed by vision because it was designed
01:11:05 -  design means there was an intent by God of a particular kind
01:11:11 -  that has to do with things that are lasting and enduring. Not just for Abraham himself as a person
01:11:17 -  but all the subsequent seed of Abraham. We're born out of his loins.
01:11:23 -  We were, so to speak, in his loins when this vision came. We were already resident.
01:11:29 -  And now, it has got to be brought to consciousness. It has got to be made
01:11:35 -  our own. So, it was designed to establish the pure
01:11:43 -  spiritual relation of a living fellowship between God
01:11:49 -  and Abraham. A living fellowship. Not a technical one or a
01:11:55 -  contractual one or a business agreement but one by which life itself
01:12:01 -  is being imparted in union. Covenant is union. Covenant is an agreement
01:12:07 -  that brings into union man and woman, God and Abraham.
01:12:13 -  It's very life. It's the life that's gone out of Abraham symbolized by the dead animal
01:12:23 -  that opens the life of God that is given in the covenant and the union.
01:12:33 -  So, the spiritual relationship of a living fellowship between God and Abraham is a deep inward meaning of which
01:12:39 -  nothing but a spiritual intuition and experience could give to Abraham an effective and permanent hold.
01:12:47 -  That somehow, the depth of what covenant means was more registered on
01:12:53 -  Abraham's consciousness by the fact that it was received in vision than if he hadn't gone through
01:12:59 -  the act of it, in fact, is what this commentator is saying.
01:13:07 -  So, in what way did Abraham make known his faith in Jehovah that God could say to him
01:13:17 -  that Abraham believed and God imputed that to him, recounted that to him, reckoned to him
01:13:23 -  as righteousness? In what way did Abraham make known his faith? How is that faith demonstrated?
01:13:29 -  And in what way did Jehovah count it to him as righteousness? What a question.
01:13:35 -  The reply to both questions must not be sought in the New Testament but must be given or indicated in the context.
01:13:41 -  Don't go running elsewhere. Look into the word that is being given right here.
01:13:47 -  There might be allusions to it in the New Testament, as in fact there is in Romans 4,
01:13:53 -  but we want to dig the essential meaning out in the place where it is given in the beginning,
01:13:59 -  Genesis. What reply did Abraham make when receiving the promise
01:14:05 -  and what did he do in consequence when God to confirm the promise declared himself to be
01:14:11 -  Jehovah who brought him out of all the Chaldees to give him that land as a possession?
01:14:17 -  Abraham replied, Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall possess it? And then God directed him to fetch a heifer
01:14:23 -  three years old and so on. Abraham fetched the animals required, arranged them as we may certainly suppose
01:14:29 -  though it is not expressly stated as God had commanded him. The text doesn't tell us
01:14:35 -  but he says we can suppose that what Abraham did was what God commanded, and
01:14:41 -  exactly in the way in which it was commanded. And by this readiness to perform
01:14:47 -  what God commanded him, Abraham gave practical proof that he believed Jehovah.
01:14:55 -  A moment's respectful silence. What is faith? What is Abrahamic faith?
01:15:01 -  How did God know that Abraham really believed? Because he did.
01:15:07 -  In perfect obedience what God commanded him, by the readiness to perform.
01:15:13 -  That's more than just performing. It's a state of being. It's a frame of mind.
01:15:19 -  It's an attitude of heart that you're ready to act the moment God will show you.
01:15:25 -  It's the heart that says, I delight to do thy will, O God. It's not because I
01:15:31 -  like that particular obedience. Whatever it is I delight to do it
01:15:37 -  because it's you who are commanding it. It's not what the obedience is. It has not to
01:15:43 -  do with our preference that we would like this or as against that. Whatever the will of
01:15:49 -  God is, we delight to do thy will. We're all geared up. We're ready to go. We're just waiting
01:15:55 -  for the revelation of it. It's a mindset. It's a disposition. It's faith. It's not
01:16:01 -  some begrudging compliance. I guess I got to. It's a readiness
01:16:07 -  of mind that makes Abrahamic faith faith.
01:16:15 -  By this readiness to perform what God commanded him, Abraham gave a practical proof
01:16:21 -  to believe Jehovah. And what God did with the animal so arranged was a practical declaration on the part of Jehovah that
01:16:27 -  he reckoned this faith to Abraham as righteousness. The significance of the divine act is summed up in verse 18
01:16:33 -  in the words, on that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, on that day, on these conditions, on this
01:16:39 -  readiness to perform, the covenant was made. Jehovah reckoned
01:16:45 -  Abraham's faith to him as righteousness by making a covenant with him, by
01:16:51 -  taking Abraham into
