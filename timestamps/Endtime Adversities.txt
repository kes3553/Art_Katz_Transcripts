Endtime Adversities

00:00 -  I'm sitting here on the couch in a modern television studio. Well-fed, comfortable, the atmosphere is perfect, calm, regulated. My face has been powdered and I'm pampered and yet I want to speak to you about things so earnest and
00:17 -  solemn that the whole situation seems completely out of kilter. Seen upon my heart are the concerns for the end times and I have my Bible open to Joel the second chapter. Blow ye the trumpet of Zion and sound an alarm in my
00:38 -  holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand, a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness. As the morning spread upon the mountains, a
00:52 -  great people and a strong. There has not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. I tell you that I have great sympathy for Joel and for the prophets of God who have ever been the
01:07 -  instrument of his proclamation. Men who had a sense of burden and urgency in their hearts far in advance of the conditions which they saw by the eye of this earth and had to proclaim to a people sitting in comfort, sitting in
01:24 -  padded sofas, sitting with pampered bodies and and powdered faces that the day of the Lord is at hand and that the end times are here. I appreciate your sympathy and as we attempt to express this burden through our discussion
01:45 -  today, I just want to take up some definitions which I hope will be helpful for you. As I talked to the Lord recently at some meetings for his message, it did not come in the time that I expected and we had days of fasting and prayer and
02:03 -  yet the heavens were as the proverbial brass, but one day sitting in at the very beginning of these sessions while another speaker, what was proclaiming the burden of her heart, in an instant the Lord just dropped
02:15 -  something upon my consciousness and in my spirit and I saw as it were lit up in great letters, end time messages and it was not as if the Lord had given me some new messages to speak which I had not proclaimed before, but I saw that
02:29 -  these were not new. They had ever and always been the burden of my heart, the concerns for discipleship, the fascination with the character of the prophet Elijah as a type of an Elijah band that God would be shaping in the
02:43 -  end time, but I saw them all anew in a more urgent focus and it's that urgency with which I wish to express to you today. So let's just follow this and as I use this blackboard, end time messages and I suppose that the first phrase
03:04 -  that we ought to define is the meaning of the word end times itself and the definitions that I'm going to give are not necessarily perfect renderings or the most exact, but the things which the Lord impressed upon my heart on that
03:22 -  occasion and which serve the purpose in the thing which I want to express this morning out of the text that I'll use. So what about the aspect of the end times? One thing that shall characterize it is adversity or crisis. Maybe it's
03:43 -  more correct to say crises because these shall come in great magnitude and great complexity and I think almost all of us have a sense that the world has come to such a place already, so wholly interdependent, so caught up in one
03:59 -  another's fortunes that something as distant as a war in the Middle East affects to the degree of comfort, in fact, our very security in the winter months that are upon us. There's not a thing that happens anywhere in the world
04:14 -  that is not registered under our own roof in our kitchen table and in our relationships with those with whom we're most dear and that gives indication of what these end times shall be, that when these crises deepen in their magnitude
04:28 -  we shall visibly be shaken in a series of circumstances of adversities, of trying crises that we have not known before. Well, what is an end-time crisis or adversity? They are crises and adversities of ultimate proportion. How
04:48 -  often have we heard it said when we discuss with unsafe friends the things which ring so ominously in our own hearts and cause us to tremble into fear for safety and for the future of the human race? They say, well, we've had
05:05 -  things like that in the past. There have been wars, there have been rumors of wars, there have been social breakdowns, there have been cataclysmic events, and we stumble with frustration and we choke and we splutter and we can't begin to express to them that what is coming, although the
05:18 -  world has tasted of it in some form before, we have never seen it in so universal a form, so totally eclipsing the whole of modern civilization in life and in such ultimate proportion. And what can we say then about the nature of crises, the nature of crisis and
05:38 -  adversity? There's something about crisis that reveals our condition. Ever been caught in an elevator between floors? Ever been in a ship in which the alarm has gone off for a fire? There we were poised just a moment before, expressing ourselves in the most polite way and showing
05:56 -  ourselves forth as civil, as educated, as cultured, and a very paragon of virtue. But in another moment there's that sickening alarm or the awkward smell of smoke or caught between the floors and plunged into darkness and another face is revealed entirely. And I just want to suggest to you that
06:14 -  the face that's revealed in crisis is the true face. Oh, it's one thing to sit on the couch and to proclaim out of the Word of God or to sit in our congregations and to praise God with our hands raised and have a wonderful time of fellowship together. But what will be our condition in a
06:32 -  time of ultimate crisis? Because that will reveal what our real spiritual condition is. Crisis reveals and ultimate crisis reveals ultimately or wholly or fully, revealing our true condition and the condition of the world. The world is going to be seen for what it really is. The masquerade
06:59 -  will be over and all of its pretension to culture and to civility and decorum will just vanish like a wisp and its savage, naked, brutal character, its self-seeking, selfish root at the wellspring of our existence and our civilization. That this is Satan's domain ruled over by him and activated
07:20 -  and dominated by the principles of lust and ambition and force that shall be nakedly revealed and every pretense gone in a moment. And as the world shall be revealed in its full darkness, so shall our life be more brilliantly revealed by that contrast. I suppose many of us were led to
07:41 -  believe that we would not be here when these end times came and I don't want to labor much on that. I don't feel that I'm really qualified to speak about when it is that God is going to remove the body of Christ from the conditions which are coming upon the world. But I have a sense in all my heart
07:58 -  and the activities to which the Lord is leading us in discipling others and especially Jewish believers that somehow at least a portion of this experience shall indeed come upon us and be used of God by the light which shall be shining through us in that darkness to bring people to him even
08:17 -  in that extremity. And so for us there shall be trial and what's my definition of a trial? A crushing stress. Why? What are the means? Where it be it an economic problem or a psychological circumstance or something in our family or in our relationship? Stress of the of inordinate kind of
08:41 -  of great pressure crushing to what degree beyond our natural ability or capacity to relieve or overcome. Many of us speak about the word faith and it's become a kind of an unctuous thing and I guess in the minds of many people it's equated with a kind of a feeling or a talent or a disposition
09:13 -  that some people might have as a virtue in greater proportions than others. It's just a happy accident like a talent for painting or for music but not so. Faith is something tested in the crucible. Faith is some kind of deep commitment and the kind of things that's forged in exactly
09:30 -  the background of what is being laid here in principle. So I want to just speak a word of faith, a definition and I suppose there are many definitions for the word faith but one that will serve our purposes today is total dependency upon God's word or we can say God's promises unto
10:01 -  you and you fill in the last word. What do you suppose that that last word is? And I tell you except to be the last word that I have in my heart and mind I don't think it requires faith at all. We don't need faith for things that we can easily out of our own natural strength and
10:20 -  capacity solve but we need that whole dependency upon the foolishness of God's words, God's promises independent of the things which are seen and understood that are natural in situations and crises which are unto death. And if you've been brought at the hand of God to a place of
10:43 -  increasing maturity spiritually and usefulness in this kingdom it's been by exactly this expediency. You have allowed yourself to be brought by the Lord to places of testing and trial where you have no alternative but to utterly cast yourself upon him and his word and accept that he is true
11:02 -  and it was he who called you out of that boat of security familiarity into what was a seeming death that you might walk upon the water you would have perished. And many of us shall learn that cry, yea though you slay me, yet will I trust you. I'm trusting the Lord now that I not be slain by
11:22 -  embarrassment or mortification as I stand before these cameras and before these men in the studio and before you in your living room that I've made some kind of a blithering idiot or become tongue-tied or grow all of a sudden silent and have nothing to say and show myself forth foolishly.
11:40 -  And I tell you people that the fear of death death is far more real for us and far more significant than that death which has only to do with the cessation of consciousness. Many of us are far more ready for that death just to flick the switch and be taken out of the scene groovy.
11:58 -  We're much more run to that than to face the death to which God really calls us the death of sufferings, the death of self-denial, the death of embarrassment, the death of mortification, the death of commitment in a world that shall grow increasingly hostile to the way of God and
12:18 -  to the word of God when we shall stand upon it in the end times, in times of increasing adversity and crisis. When men's hearts shall fail them for fear, what shall they say to us when we shall stand as foolish instruments and say Christ is the answer? Will they just look upon us with disdain
12:38 -  and ill humor or when they look upon us I believe in another way as a dangerous menace and as a real obstacle to the progress and to the solution of human ills? And I believe that in that season that we shall know a degree of persecution that believers have not known in 2,000 years
12:57 -  and we shall see the fulfillment of the scriptures that men shall slay us and claim that they do in God or perhaps humanity a service. We shall be a real obstruction with our foolishness, our foolish solutions, our trying to turn the attention of a world in desperate crisis
13:15 -  to the remedy of God by his word. Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. How shall that register in the years of the world when men's hearts shall fail them for fear, when they cannot breathe their air nor drink their water,
13:31 -  when their governments shall be collapsing in anarchy and chaos and there's no authority and men shall be running and looting and pillaging and raping in the streets like so many savages? Shall they be looking to a Christ and to a God and to his word or shall they be looking to
13:45 -  their legislation, to the armaments, to their state troopers and to all the kinds of devices which men turn in times of crisis? Oh I tell you how shall we stand then and what kind of faith shall we sport then? Perhaps it's no accident that God says that when he returns shall he find
14:03 -  faith in the earth, shall he find actual commitment, actual trust in the foolishness of his word when men will seek to strike us and smite us and extinguish us and stop their ears because what we have to suggest to them is not just mere idle foolishness but a dangerous divergency what seems
14:23 -  to them the most apparent necessity for wisdom and solution of very grave problems. Faith is no white matter nor shall a believer be a light thing in the end times and so does the God speaks to us in advance of the events themselves and I suppose to what degree that I'm fulfilling
14:48 -  a prophetic function of crying out and being used of God to express something yet not seen I understand and begin to experience something of the frustration of people who look at you and say how do you speak of these things now in the comfort of this security
15:04 -  or coming forth out of our color television sets in the beauty of our home surrounded with every amenity and convenience and luxury and there's not a sign anywhere that our life or our situation is to be troubled or imperiled I pray that the spirit of God will give witness to the thing
15:22 -  which he has led me to share today but let's turn to the scriptures and see if we can find a text that illumines the thing that that that we want to express and I think that it especially delights me as a Jewish believer to find such a text
15:43 -  in the old testament scriptures in the book of second chronicles and I don't suppose that this is going to be something new and in fact I'm pleased that it's not I don't want to be an instrument to titillate the ears of God's people or speak something cunning or something ingenious
16:03 -  I think that much greater these I see it in my own life is not to hear things that are new new but to hear the things which are old the things which are true the things which are deep the essential principles and way and pattern of God that we might know his way and the
16:22 -  infinite with his voice and with his expression that when these circumstances come we shall not be stunned and be caught unsuspecting and so in second chronicles
16:37 -  in the 20th chapter we read about a an episode an incident in the life of the Jewish people Judah and it says it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Amon and with them other beside the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat
16:56 -  the battle and there came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from behind the sea of this side of Syria and behold they be in which is isn't it interesting how in just two verses God can set the stage an enormous spectacle is being
17:18 -  described here a crisis of ultimate proportions great armies the uncircumcised standing on the very threshold the frontiers the borders of the land of the people of God ready to inundate them and crush the very life out of them ancestral ages-old enemies the Ammonites the Moabites
17:43 -  those people descendants from lots and that progeny which came by the illicit relationship with his own daughters oh I tell you there's something ominous in that that I don't know quite how to express that somehow the enemies are those who are distantly related to us
18:00 -  and they even seem to have some a seeming relationship or appearance like us there's some kind of a kinship and yet are they utterly different conceived in another context something hostile to the Holy Spirit of God and they've always been opposed to us always
18:17 -  been as enmity with us and now their opportunity is full and they're going to seek to do us in of whom can these scriptures possibly speak if we try to see them in the light of end time conditions I could suggest I don't know how valid this is it might be the nominal world church
18:36 -  distantly related to us and yet a kind of a bastard expression if I may use that that kind of a phrase and and inimical to God and to God's people hostile and seeking to do a sin of whom is it that it that it speaks that they shall slay us and and think that they're doing God a service
18:55 -  that they shall employ a vocabulary of religion and of God I just leave that for your consideration but at least we can say this the enemy is great the forces are overwhelming and that the circumstances are such they're beyond our own natural strength or our ability
19:14 -  to resolve or to to make right a great multitude against thee and what's the next verse Jehoshaph feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed they fast throughout all Judah I tell you that such words are like music in my soul Jehoshaphat feared I know that fear is an
19:37 -  unmanly thing and and but it's not that fear that God is speaking of here where we were so fearful and so rattled that that were made ineffective and incapable of action no this is a sober and right manly regard for the magnitude of the enemy and the forces which are pitted against us this
19:57 -  is not unmanly at all and it's not unbecoming it's right far better than we should be foolish children and think that we're jousting with it with some kind of windmill and that if we rub an abracadabra a vase that some genie will come out in a formula in the name of Jesus and the evil
20:13 -  spirits will flee we've not seen them flee because it's been only an incantation an empty phrase and we've not yet come to the earnest place to which Jehoshaphat had come he feared and you know how earnest he was he set himself to seek the Lord I confess my own personal inadequacy to
20:33 -  comment on such a phrase as that and I can only think of a few instances where God had brought me personally to such an extremity that I set myself to seek the Lord I'm not schooled to set myself my first 35 years were spent in coasting there was little in this world that required the totality
20:54 -  of all that I am in mind and body and soul and spirit so to be sealed and be gathered together in my loins that I would be fitted for combat I coasted I coasted in the service I coasted as a kid I got by with my personality I got by with my cleverness I got by subsequently in my university
21:13 -  experience very little was required from me that was total this has been a rather soft generation it's an affluent generation not a generation that has required the totality of what we of what we are that that we should meet conditions that would bring us to a sharp edge of availability
21:38 -  we hardly know what it means even as believers to set ourselves but I remember one occasion when God brought me to Jerusalem as a believer to be a speaker in a conference to which the saints and the missionaries and the workers in that great land where many of the great end time things that
21:56 -  have been fulfilled were called and who was I to speak to them and what is it that I should speak out of my own cunning my own wisdom or my own well-meaning intentions I was a desperate hopeless man before God stretched out before him and remember we had one night before the beginning
22:14 -  of those meetings a time of prayer in the garden tomb with the choicest things of God and I sat there like a mute stock thing and they prayed and I heard the prayer going about the room and I could not so much as open my mouth and something was beginning to well over me
22:33 -  I was beginning to plumb and to probe and to reach depths that had not before been touched because I had not before been in a crisis of this magnitude and something finally erupted out of my mouth I was startled in the hearing I had never heard myself pray so profoundly I had never heard
22:52 -  such an urgent cry rise up out of the depths of my own soul as I heard that day and I went to God that I could say that that these times have been frequent but they have been they have not been and people our God is ever and always a deep calling unto a deep why is it that the Lord
23:13 -  allows these circumstances to come upon his people it said it came to pass after this also that the ammobites the moabites and the ammonites came against them after what not a time of apostasy a time of researchers a time of restoration very much like what is happening even now where
23:33 -  are the ascents this is a time of being returned to the pattern of God this is the restoration of spiritual things where we're where we're getting earnest in our souls we're coming together as a body this is a wonderful hour and yet in that same hour God allows a crisis
23:50 -  of unspeakable proportion to come against Judah and so also shall it come against us in the end times because although God is a deep calling unto deep we have not answered out of the deep we've answered out of the surface out of the very surface of our lives superficially with
24:11 -  with catchwords with with evangelistic devices with promotions with carnivals of Christian entertainment we've not stretched ourselves out before God we've not set ourselves to seek him there's not been that urgency and you know what the evidence was that Jehoshaphat proclaimed a
24:31 -  fast throughout old Judah praise God that among the things that are being restored is the necessity for fasting and there are many of us who are believers who have yet to experience the thing so elementary in God's sight that the Lord Jesus himself spoke of fasting with with the
24:49 -  same kind of phrase as he spoke of prayer when you pray he said he used the very same phrase for fasting when you fast when you do this most necessary and expected thing and we've lost sight and we've not challenged the control of the flesh over our spiritual lives
25:09 -  but i'll tell you you proclaim a fast in your land and you'll hear subterranean murmurings and cries and shrieks that you've not before experienced there's a God who's calling us a deep unto a deep that we might be a people prepared for an eternal relationship with him for our faith
25:27 -  does he allow the Moabites and the Ammonites to stand on our borders and empower us that we might set our faces before him and proclaim a fast throughout all Judah i ask you to prepare your hearts for the continuation of this message in the next
25:46 -  segment of this telecast that shall come and look with me earnestly that God might speak to us the fullness of the thought that we might be a people prepared for him in these end times i think it's rather symbolic that i'm standing in front of this impressive array of books
26:08 -  how long was my own heart and life moved by such things as this and i thought at one time that it would be impossible to lay hold of the collective wisdom of mankind and what a frustrating venture to try by the encompassing of all of this wisdom to find a course for conduct and for life
26:28 -  i have just the strangest impression as we say before the symbolic bookcase that symbolic bookcase that in the hour at which the Lord is bringing an unsuspecting world what shall all their wisdom and all their encyclopedias mean
26:44 -  will be just so much dust so much drops and shall be alike consummated by flame and turned to the dust which it is to what then shall men look for wisdom in an age of increasing crisis and complexity for end times
27:06 -  the wisdom of God expressed in his word very God himself and to be led by the spirit and by the word and that's been the burden of our hearts through the things which we've been sharing in these teaching situations and we spoke on the last occasion of how the Lord flashed at a meeting
27:24 -  a certain phrase in our hearts as we sat waiting upon him end time messages and i just have to confess my inadequacy to be any kind of a spokesman to tell you in clear terms to what degree God's people are going to be submitted to end time conditions or to be freed or relieved of them
27:44 -  but all that's in my heart seems to speak the word preparation to blow the trumpet in Zion and speak of an increasing darkness and a gloom which is gathering and and we suggested in the last telecast certain definitions which will be important for us to consider in the light of what
28:05 -  it is that God has placed upon our heart to express that the things that shall characterize the end time certain nature of crisis and adversity that shall come upon the world and in which God's children shall not wholly be exempt that there'll be a furnace of affliction
28:23 -  but there'll be a fourth man in that furnace with them that there'll be a wilderness and a solitariness and a rejection but one with them even in that persecution crises of ultimate proportion and the nature of these crises is to reveal ultimately not only the naked condition
28:44 -  of the world long a hostile and that enmity with God but also to reveal our own condition and pray God that when the revelation comes we not we shall not be found wanting carnal selfish insensitive that we ourselves shall collapse because of the pressures that shall come upon us
29:04 -  so habituated were we to luxury and to affluence that when it came to a time of self-denial we simply cracked and could not stand and what shall be the nature of these trials crushing stress beyond our natural capacity to relieve or to overcome i almost feel like saying dumps it up
29:24 -  dumb hey is that an accident or is the lord using exactly this expedient to bring us beyond our own natural strength and beyond our own natural wisdom to bring us to a place of death in relationship to God and to each other and with ourselves that we have not before known and to which we would
29:45 -  have shrunk because it's not an easy place to come and in that extremity and in that crisis the means by which we shall be saved and be an instrument of God's salvation to others is that whole and total dependency upon the foolish promises and word of God even unto
30:06 -  death and in fact that except that it be a matter unto death it hardly requires any faith worth speaking of at all and to to bring these abstract definitions into a kind of a meaningful context we began to speak last time about a certain episode that came upon God's Jewish people
30:26 -  I suppose that as a Jewish man myself I can't read these descriptions with any kind of equanimity with any kind of equanimity and poise and look upon them as just academic instruction after all this is a record of what my Jewish people suffer of what they experience through
30:46 -  their own sweat and tears and blood and death that these things are written for our admonition upon whom the end of the age has come we spoke about the fearful calamity last time of what is described in the book of second chronicles in the 20th chapter great armies uncircumcised enemies of
31:08 -  Israel standing on its very borders ancestral enemies at enmity with God and with God's people and now so overbearing in their great might that they threaten to crush the very existence of the people of Judah but praise God for a Jehoshaphat God raising up a man a man that God uses
31:29 -  not fashion in a moment nor a day and allowing such circumstances to come not when Israel is apostate or being led by some backslidden king but in a moment of return in a moment of restoration very much like our own period right now and so when these things happened Jehoshaphat feared
31:51 -  and set himself to seek the Lord and we began to speak of that last time what it means to set oneself and how little this is known in our own actual experience and yet how becoming it is for the man that God uses to know how to set himself to seek the Lord and how my how only by the grace
32:11 -  of God when I myself am compelled and required to do this because I'm pushed beyond my own natural strength do I find God in a new way in a new depth and a new intensity and there's a chord struck in my soul of deep calling entity to which God has long sought us and wanting to save us out
32:27 -  of a world that is eminently superficial and trivial and surface and I tell you people accept that we be saved from it and be brought to that depth now I have a feeling that at whatever point we are in the moment that this natural life shall be ended I think that we might well be fixated at
32:44 -  that particular place of superficial superficiality or depth to be free to enjoy or to lose the enjoyment of the unspeakable riches which God has laid up for those who love him it behooves us to come to a place of death spiritually now that we might be heir to all the things which God has
33:04 -  laid up for us our eternal reward and so Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and that wasn't just an unctuous phrase the evidence of it was this that he proclaimed they fast about old Judah just like the fast that that Esther called for when the very life of the
33:22 -  Jewish people was again at stake and just like the fast into which God is again returning us as an aspect of our normal Christian life so important yet so little known in the lives of most believers and I'll tell you when we'll undertake it for the first time we'll begin to
33:38 -  understand why it is with so long shrunk from it it's nothing less than dying oh we're absolutely persuaded we're not going to make it we walk into furniture we see spots before our eyes and such hostile growls and sounds emanating from subterranean places that we as which we had not
33:56 -  thought to exist and so long as we had not challenged the flesh we could have gone on playing at our Sunday school exercises and gone on Sunday 12 churches and potluck suppers and our other nice Christian activity and we would have not had in any way been hampered but I'll tell you
34:12 -  when you in earnest begin to contend in that eternal confrontation between flesh and the spirit you're in another kind of ballgame and it behooves us well to begin to understand that confrontation now that when the enemies are found standing on our boundaries we're not called to an experience
34:31 -  with which we have no familiarity Jehoshaphat proclaimed the fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord praise God aren't those words music in your ears as they are in mine
34:51 -  and isn't the great scandal of Christianity been on notorious divisiveness and haven't Jews long murmured to us what are you trying to commend to me with your Methodist church and Baptist church and Episcopalian church and all of your various denominations separate one from another
35:09 -  and in a kind of a subtle competition one with another I'll tell you that one of God's end time purposes as we well know is to bring a unity to the body of Christ and if we'll not come to it eagerly and willingly perhaps in the last analysis will be eight will be compelled to come to it out
35:27 -  of a mutual necessity to find ourselves a raid against a common enemy Judah gathered themselves together and I know my Jewish people well individualistic my goodness they say that if you have two Jews you'll have three arguments and one of the great miracles of Israel far
35:47 -  beyond our own Jewish capacity has been the establishment of the kibbutz team where men have lived together ordering their lives in common a pattern more in keeping with the book of acts than few realize because it was a necessary method of establishing their life
36:08 -  Judah gathered themselves together despite the individualism despite their differences to ask help of the Lord I'll tell you except that we be in that one spirit and one accord shall he hear us in that extremity even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord praise God that
36:26 -  this shall soon be part of the experience of God's body as we move into these end times and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord and before the new court and said oh Lord God of our father are not thou God in heaven and rule us not thou
36:45 -  of all the kingdom of the heathen and in thy hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art not thou our God who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel and gave it to the seat of Abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein as
37:00 -  built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name I'll tell you maybe it's only extremity that brings us to a place of remembrance of just what it is that God has wrought in our lives maybe it's just circumstances like this alone that will bring us to recapitulate that long trek out of
37:21 -  the bondage of Egypt and through our wilderness and to the land of promise for the purpose of establishing God's temple in his holy hill maybe we need to be reminded of what the whole purpose of God has been in his long history with us and maybe nothing less than such extremity as this
37:38 -  will free us from the daily round of our small activities and Christian playacting and evangelistic devices to see the eternal focus of God and what his supreme and ultimate purposes have been from the beginning we need to be brought again to see the entire perspective of God for without
37:58 -  a vision that people perish and so the Jehoshaphat reminds God according to his own word that when we stood at this temple and called upon you and said that if evil comes upon us as the sword or judgment or pestilence or famine and we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy
38:18 -  name is in this house and cry unto thee in our afflictions then will thou hear and help oh I tell you people that there's almost something criminal in reading such a verse as that and moving on with but a moment commentary it deserves surely an hour in itself I just pick out the
38:37 -  familiar words when evil comes upon us sword judgment pestilence famine why if my memory serves me correctly are those the very things that are cited in the book of revelation in the activity of the four apocalyptic horsemen that shall be visited upon this earth in the end time
38:58 -  the sword judgment pestilence and famine is it any accident that these things are also cited in the book of chronicles they are the constituent element of the of the judgment of God coming upon the earth and the very thing which shall drive men either to their ultimate
39:14 -  knees before God that have long rejected him or to their last defiance shall also serve some purpose in us because it says that it elicited from them when we shall cry unto thee in our afflictions when have we cried last I suppose another one of our scandal is the fact that
39:36 -  we've been too long dry-eyed we jews have an expression out of the kishkes out of the guts out of the inmost depth of our life is the real reality the real center of existence when have we been there last and I tell you that it will not come there
39:56 -  for love of truth if everything about us conspires against it if the whole spirit of the world militates against death and towards superficiality maybe it'll only be when the four apocalyptic make their appearance that will come that out of our depths will come such a cry
40:13 -  as came out of the heart of judah in their affliction for then will now hear and help and now behold the children of amen and moab and mount seer whom thou wast not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt and but turned from them and destroyed them not behold I
40:31 -  say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit all our God will not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee praise God can you see his
40:52 -  great wisdom in so ordering circumstances of this kind how long have we been assured in our own devices and thought that all we need do is to invite a flashy evangelist or to pound pulpit or distribute circulars or clever promotion or advertising and fills
41:11 -  buildings or arenas and somehow that the great deep purposes of Godless men would be effective I tell you the lord has got to bring us to a place that we recognize again as we've never before understood that in him is our salvation we have no might against this great company that comes
41:29 -  against us neither know we what to do and maybe there's something poignant coming out of my own spirit in life because the lord has allowed me to be in places in universities and other such places of encounter faced by hostile audiences or angry rabbis or yeshiva students well out of it
41:51 -  exhausted and spent feeling not very clever at all my voice a weak and pathetic thing my speech most unbecoming and hearing these clever men with their angry retorts and not knowing how to answer and there's a cry that has to go out of the heart of God's service in such a time
42:10 -  lord i don't know what to speak i don't know what to do but my eyes are set upon the city oh precious people can you see that in these crises that God is working one purpose in the life of those in the world who have rejected him and yet another purpose in those who have
42:32 -  called upon his name but not in that depth and not in that truth and not by that urgent and real spirit with which we ought he's bringing us to a place where we learn that we're beyond our own devices and beyond our own means when we have no might against this great company that comes
42:50 -  against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon they when all judas stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children praise God that he gives us that little afterthought i tell you that my own spiritual life would have been far different if i had just
43:10 -  been fending for myself through these years i tell you would have been far different if i had not the responsibility of being God's minister and servant i would have been far more nonchalant far less disposed to the sufferings and the denials of fastings and other such exertions
43:25 -  before God i would have been far more casual a believer far more carnal but because the stakes were great because other lives were involved because i stood with my face hanging out not just because of my own threadbare life but all juda with their little ones and their wives and
43:46 -  their children that we were most earnestly dependent upon God oh i tell you the lord knows how to bring us to our knees and our little ones shall not be exempt and all you need do is to turn to the literature of the maccabees in that time when greeks and the greek spirit was running
44:06 -  riot and our temple was desecrated and those jews who stood against that spirit saw their own children taken from them and their very skin slayed from their bodies cut up in pieces and hacked before our sight but we did not give in we did not relent we stood doggedly and determinably
44:24 -  before the opponents of God as a testimony that we would not allow the temple to be profane for though it costs us the lives of our little ones i tell you people except that the cost is total except that it's urgently a matter of life after death not just for ourselves but all that
44:42 -  is due to us we shall not be before God what he would have us to be then it says upon jihosh fiel the son of zachariah a levite of the sons of asa came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation i love it when a verse begins with the word then because it seems to suggest to
45:06 -  me that certain necessary conditions have been fulfilled there's a God who is just waiting to express by his spirit to us wisdom needed for life into the congregation by his gift and through his ministers when the conditions are fulfilled when he shall see us earnestly together with our
45:29 -  eyes set upon him then shall again come as it did then the spirit of the lord into the midst of the congregation through the priest how does the spirit speak and he said harken ye old juda and your inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou king jihoshaphat thus sayeth the lord unto you be not afraid
45:50 -  nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God what a relief to know why that changes everything that removes from us that debilitating anxiety the lord has it all in hand that his battles is his struggle if not ours they were not expected
46:11 -  to undertake it in our puny might say but wait a minute maybe that was a device of the enemy maybe that was something to distract us that that we would be unprepared and to give us a false sense of security say how about that priest through whom that message came was that
46:28 -  really in the spirit i have always wondered about that guy i tell you if we miss it then there are great stakes involved the gifts of the spirit are not some little panoply of God some little device to make our meetings more exciting and more electric i tell you that in
46:48 -  the end time they shall be the difference between life and death and that we have the perfect expression of God without any distraction of the flesh shall be a question of great moments shall we wait then to perfect such offices and the operation such gifts or is God speaking to us
47:10 -  now and asking us and summoning and beckoning us to so be moved by the spirit and so perfect and be used of God that when that moment shall come his voice shall come forth slowly how is it to be done in our great congregations now where our hearts pound when the spirit begins to move
47:29 -  upon us and we're afraid to make a mistake before God and before men herein lies the beauty of what God is working in home fellowships in small groups of God's people meeting face to face in the operation of the gifts of the spirit over the kitchen table where we can well afford a mist
47:48 -  as well as a hit where we can well afford occasionally a lapse into the flesh as well as a lapse into the spirit that by such testings and by such exercising of the spirit we can come to that perfect expression that when all judas shall wait on the perfect wisdom of God when
48:04 -  it's light of that life or death we shall have the perfect expression of God and he shall again remind us that the battle is not ours but his and it changes the face of everything thus says the lord until you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle
48:27 -  is not yours but God and how does he continue tomorrow go ye down against them and behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of geruel you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves and stand ye still and see
48:44 -  the salvation of the lord with you oh juda and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you say what kind of God is this what what does he mean by this why does he give us such a word of this in advance of the great confrontation tomorrow
49:07 -  i'll tell you that if i suspect the intent of the lord of rights isn't this a real test of our faith and our commitment tomorrow go out against them the battle is not yours but mine oh we're so fired up to hear these great words our hearts palpitate and swell with excitement and with
49:25 -  we have heard the word of the lord and he shall do it but tomorrow is yet another thing and how often have we experienced that in our fellowships on sunday we hear the word of the lord proclaim and the gifts of the spirit exercise and the lord gives us assurance tomorrow
49:43 -  go ye out against them and then comes that cold gray dawn that monday following the speaking of God and we wonder was it really the word of the lord that we heard will it really work we're no longer in that same environment in that same setting now we're alone on the job or facing an
50:02 -  unbelieving husband or desperately striving with rebellious children or our own conflict between the flesh and the spirit or in our relationships of the demands which God brings us can we believe his word then tomorrow go ye down against them fear not nor be dismayed why does God air that
50:25 -  little flourish nor be dismayed because we may have rid ourselves of our fears but what do our faces reveal but that sickly kind of dismay and for that reason we look no more different than the world who sport the same kind of apprehensive faith stand still and see the salvation of the
50:47 -  lord what is more difficult for men than to stand still the whole tenor of our life is activity doing going having spending and i'll tell you that the lord gave me recently a moment of such unspeakable joy as i was a guest at a growing new testament fellowship
51:09 -  and there God's minister kicked out of his own denomination because of his fidelity to God in the coming into the gifts of the spirit in the in the school room where their meetings were being conducted in a growing young fellowship spontaneous and alive before God in every meeting different
51:28 -  this precious Godly man who had grown up in the denomination which subtly and overtly and covertly promotes activity and doing and reputation leaned over the pulpit and said let us wait on the lord and i blinked my eyes and thought oh yes what a wonderful rhetorical flourish
51:47 -  but my God he meant it and he actually waited and i tell you there was a silence the silences of which we're so afraid oh what if somebody is coming to see our fellowship and they've heard so many wonderful things about it and they'll be disappointed they'll
52:03 -  think of the foolish people sitting in silence like imbeciles he waited on the lord stand ye still and see the salvation of God stop spinning your wheels stop stop clobbering your unsaved husband with scriptures stop your foolish devices and your evangelistic techniques
52:23 -  and your methods stand still and see the salvation of the lord have the courage to wait upon him that except that his word be true and the battle is truly hid we shall surely perish faith do we have it faith for the end times faith for extremity faith for crisis
52:50 -  even on the seeming dash let's bow our heads and ask God oh lord help us shape us to be such a people as this that we might go forth tomorrow confident that what you've spoken will be true
