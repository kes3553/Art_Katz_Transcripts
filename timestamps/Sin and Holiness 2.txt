Sin and Holiness 2

00:00 -  How many of us are the churches out of the land, out of the place of blessing, out of the spiritual Zion for the failure to hallow his name, that God would be severe in his punishment to Moses for that failure and be lenient with us would be a contradiction. More of us are out of the land
00:23 -  and it shows Bible reading is obligatory. It's no pleasure. Witness is very rare. Prayer is an ordeal, a requirement in which there's no delight. Fellowship is shallow. We're out of the land. We're out of the blessedness that would be ours by entry and kept for the same reason for which he denied
00:46 -  Moses. And I want to raise the question, if God in honoring Moses whom he called his friend and with whom he spoke face to face requires of Moses this severe dealing, what does that teach us? And if God had allowed Moses to get by on this on the basis of a long relationship
01:10 -  in which you have been faithful and have borne much for my name because you know how ministers justified his sin, look how much I've done for God. Therefore, I'm entitled to this special recompense. He knows that I need it. If God had said, because you have been so faithful,
01:27 -  I'll overlook this and permit you the same entry as the nation itself. What kind of statement would that be of God in leniency? His name would have been unhallowed. His own conduct of looking the other way and of not being appropriately severe in judgment would have contradicted himself as a
01:51 -  holy God. And do you think that keeping Moses out of land did not cost God something as father? That he himself did not experience the hurt and didn't empathize with the anguish that Moses had to bear of dying without entry into the land? That that was as much an affliction for the father
02:12 -  who required it as Moses himself who suffered it? That in all of our afflictions he's afflicted, in all of our judgments he experiences the moral anguish of it and yet does not withhold himself? You want to know what righteousness is? This is righteousness. You want to know what holiness is?
02:29 -  This is holiness. God is not exempt from the moral anguish and the pain of his own judgments and his own requirements. He's not acting from some lofty height in which he's impervious and unaffected by what he requires of men. It hurt him to keep Moses out of the land, but he had to do it. His
02:51 -  name required a judgment appropriate to the sin, to the transgression. So for God to be light in this and to look it over as we do with our own children and with ourselves, we are remarkably lenient. That's why Karl Barth says if we were not for the crucified Christ
03:14 -  and we have to assess our own morality and our own iniquity, we will always be a judge favorable to ourselves. We will always pronounce a sentence lighter than what is deserved. But God doesn't let us get away with that as if we can determine subjectively either our own
03:34 -  condition or its judgment. The cross is God's statement that saves us from self-justifying likeness about our own condition. That's the statement as God sees it, not your subjective feeling about yourself. Your subjective feeling about yourself is itself sin.
03:55 -  It keeps you from the acknowledgement of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. So where does Paul say that he's the chief of sinners? As we came up in the morning's prayer time, is Paul talking about his past? Surely he was a murderer and a persecutor,
04:12 -  but he doesn't say I was the chief of sinners. He says I am the chief of sinners and yet the chief apostle at the same time? How can that be? And if you can't answer that, you yourself then don't know as you ought to know. Why aren't you saying I'm chief? Ironically, as you grow in
04:32 -  maturity in the knowledge of God and are becoming more conscious of your walk, at the same time, there's an increasing consciousness of this inherent disposition to transgress, if not indeed in word and thought or omission, if not commission. I'm the chief of sinners. I know exactly what I'm
04:52 -  capable of as I've never seen it before. What, David can fornicate and perform adultery and murder and I'm exonerated? You're only exonerated because life has not required it of you, but given the occasion and the temptation, you would just as equally fall as David himself,
05:13 -  unless you think that you're made of better stuff and your very thought that you are made of better stuff is the height of presumptuous sin. That you have not repented with David because you're waiting for the actual act to confirm the truth, that your sins are not before you always as it was
05:31 -  for him, means that you yourself are in a state of deception with regard to your own condition because you're blinded by your own iniquity, your own transgression. It has dulled your own awareness of your own moral condition. Just let me finish those statements
05:50 -  that I thought were so remarkable that the cross was more for God than it was for men. It was given at the time foreseen and chosen by God for his marvelous display of his own holy character. To look upon that picture of the crucified Christ is a statement of God's holy
06:12 -  character, for if he was less than that, he would have required less, but that he required that and his only beloved son to suffer the severest and vilest of capital punishments is the statement of his holiness. We have to read it rightly and if we don't read it rightly,
06:36 -  we have an inadequate knowledge of God, of holiness and of sin that will show up in our own walk. It's got to show up. It's got to surface. It's got to be revealed individually and corporately in the character of the church in our own walk. If we have not a right understanding of holiness
06:55 -  as it is revealed in the keeping of the character of God, by the willing sacrifice of his own son and his own son's willingness to bear that sacrifice. Father and son transacted in heaven transacted in heaven before Jesus came down in his pre-incarnate life and he voluntarily agreed
07:15 -  to serve this sentence and then would come down in the form of man in order to do it. This is a son's regard for the father's name that could not have been placated or met by anything less than his own sacrifice and if he's the patterned son, that's what is required to
07:34 -  hallow his father's name. What's required from us in such a generation of time as this? Where have we been callow and shallow and indulgent in our own walk and experience mindless about these things? How is it that God was so severe with Moses just for striking a rock
07:56 -  rather than speaking to it and allowed Moses to take the tablets of the law inscribed by his finger on the holy mount and smash them at the base of the mountain when he saw the nation given over to idolatry and there's not a single word of reproof from God over that act.
08:15 -  Can you dare break and smash the tablets of the law inscribed by God with impunity because you have moved to a moral indignation seeing that the nation while they were no longer waiting for you had given themselves to a golden calf? There's not a single hint of
08:33 -  reproof or correction from God for that act. How do you figure that? We need to interpret God not only by what he says and by what he does but by his silences when we think he should be saying something. You don't cast your pearls before swine and you don't bring the holy lord down to
08:51 -  people who have given themselves to idolatry of the vilest kind. He was right to smash those tablets of the law. God does not reproof him because to offer that law to the people would have been a contradiction and a parody and a sacrilege for what is holy. He was required to
09:13 -  make another ascent another 40 days to come down again and it was justified and then he grinds up the golden calf and makes them drink it and you don't hear a whimper in the scripture from any of the sons and children of Israel in that requirement to drink their own idol. God's silence is approval
09:38 -  and we need to drink it. We need to have the truth of our condition internalized, taken in, drink it. Now that I think about it, I wonder if for God's sake Moses grind up the golden calf and make them drink it. Is he commanded
09:59 -  so to do or is he in such union with God that his indignation is the father's indignation at that idolatry and that recompense of grinding it and drinking it was perfectly in keeping with God's heart and thought. It did not require a commandment, it just required a union of a holy
10:17 -  man with a holy God to do it and the same holy man himself transgresses at a later time. Just as the author of the book of Proverbs and who warns us about relationships with unGodly women and foreign wives himself later embarks on a whole career
10:40 -  of a coterie of foreign women and contradicts his own holy calling, having given us instruction and out of his own wisdom of Solomon, who then is safe? If Solomon falls, David falls, Moses falls, who then is safe and how dare we walk in any kind of presumptuous upstart way as if we have it
11:05 -  all together? Why aren't we walking as men who know that there but for the grace of God we would every one of us be fallen? How dare we critique and criticize and look a stance upon a fallen minister as if we ourselves are morally superior to that very transgression,
11:25 -  forgetting that we ourselves have been guilty? Not too long ago they were the same thing and given the opportunity we'd be equally as guilty again. There but for the grace of God go we. We ought to be a broken people, we ought to be sinners
11:40 -  being saved by grace, which the German theologian, the life together Bonhoeffer says, what is the church, what is the fellowship of saints? A community of sinners being saved by grace who are not ashamed to hear the confession of any member or expressing their own because they
12:03 -  acknowledge that they're sinners being saved by grace. Isn't that a remarkable paradox? We're saving yet we're being saved. So to have it all together, overcomers is so contrary to the temper appropriate for true church that needs to be regained in proportion as we understand this.
12:26 -  What shall we say of Peter after his betrayal of Christ? How many times before the croaked and with cursings, I mean a vile rejection, and then the brokenness and the weeping, then the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but how long after that does he have to be corrected by Paul
12:48 -  because of his hypocrisy of doing one thing with the Jewish believers and another thing with the Gentiles? There was duplicity that Paul said not for an hour will I allow this to pass for the truth of the gospel's sake that he had openly and publicly to rebuke Peter who's the the rock
13:07 -  and the first of the apostles because he himself is really slipping away and bringing others into the hypocrisy of his own deceit even that one who's called the comforter Barnabas is already reflecting Peter's transgression until Paul brings the ruthless correction,
13:26 -  the jealousy for God's honor and name. So what does it say in Hebrews? While it's yet today to catch sin in its first inception, while it is yet today to bring correction and reproof, because by next Sunday it may be already too late, the thing is already working, the leaven is in the
13:51 -  lump and before you know it you have the most outrageous sin by people who once were the most estimable in their holiness. So what is true fellowship? People so related in truth that they can discern almost immediately where there's a bit of erosion and turning away and bring a word of
14:12 -  correction. Speak the truth and love is not speaking abstract biblical truths, it's speaking the truth about a brother or sister that you're privileged to see not to exalt yourself but in brokenness to bring that correction and that attention to the one who cannot see it because
14:28 -  he's blind to his own blind spot. This is true fellowship not only for the saints, not only for the sheep but for the shepherds and the failing of shepherds which is so notorious in our generation is the statement that they themselves have not submitted and been accessible for the
14:48 -  correction that would come out of their own body. That the church, the fellowship is as much God's provision as I've said so many times for the shepherd as well as for the sheep. So the failure of the shepherd is an indictment against the body itself for its failure either to identify
15:08 -  the incipient stages of sin early enough to bring correction or to be totally oblivious to it and their human admiration for the ministry and therefore the consequence is an indictment upon themselves and their failure to speak the truth and love even to the shepherd and that the
15:27 -  environment was not conducive because he's in a little ivory tower man of faith and power thing where you don't dare see or address him in his own defect. So how often have I said why didn't you catch it in his voice? Why didn't you notice that he's moving from a certain kind
15:47 -  of naturalness toward a professional tone in his preaching and every week it's getting worse and he's losing that sense of immediacy and reality which you so appreciated and knew at the first. Why is he moving that way? Why is he losing his sense of reality and becoming every week more
16:08 -  professional? He's on the way out. He's in danger. Why didn't you tell him you're embarrassed or you didn't discern it or who are you to bring correction when you yourself need to be corrected? We're in something together saints that brings an obligation but our ability to discern is
16:29 -  relative to the correctness of our own walk. If we ourselves are dull to our own indulgences, our own moral lapses, how shall we discern the condition of the need of another? And if we have not the courage to speak it after seeing it what does that mean? We regard man more
16:47 -  than the holiness of God? We're more deferring to man than hallowing the name of the Lord? That's not an invitation for an open field day just to open up and blast what do they call it roasting the preacher every Sunday but it is an invitation to be the church speaking the truth
17:07 -  and love process and growing up into the fullness and stature of the perfect man even Jesus Christ. It's an act of involvement that requires humility and love truth a whole sense of holiness and the issue of what's at stake here is the name of God and his witness in the world because sin is so
17:28 -  rife the temptation is so manifest that it's almost an hour by hour watchfulness walk down before me where where do you not walk as I said to somebody the other day you walk into your bedroom to the dining hall to the classroom there's no place where your walk will not take
17:48 -  you and God says walk down before me why does he choose that one word because it is so all encompassing there's no activity exempt from walking that's why Jesus's feet need to be pierced through so a walk is a remarkable requirement and we're not sufficiently attentive we're not jealous
18:12 -  and I'll walk this casual slipshod and paving the way for yet more serious failing if we will not keep our hearts keep our work more than just daily but hourly flee from temptation or any appearance of evil it's amazing the liberties that we take
18:36 -  where others like when they counsel a woman will keep their office door open or call somebody else in they'll not counsel a woman alone even though they are circumspect just the very appearance of the prospect has a possibility that one cannot indulge we're not that careful
18:58 -  okay the last statement maybe I'll come back to this again the sacrifice on the cross demonstrates for the first time what God is and shows that in times past and present he is the same of purer eyes than behold evil God could not be just without
19:17 -  the sacrifice of Christ for Christ did not die that God might seem to be just but that in fact he might be just in the very act of justifying the believer and in the last paragraph of another dictionary of the Bible about sin while the person may certainly be conscious of a moral
19:39 -  acts and false motives the reality of man's sinful state can never be perceived merely by self-knowledge the thing that it can be is itself presumptuous sin the totality and inclusiveness of Adam's sin and the consequent depravity of all is an issue that is only truly made known in the
20:01 -  cross what a statement are you writing that down you need to should I go back over this while the person may certainly be conscious of a moral acts and false motives the reality and this reality dear saints is the nexus of all reality if you miss reality here on the issue of sin
20:28 -  and judgment righteousness and holiness where then shall you know reality this is the root of the whole subject of reality this is why the world is schizophrenic this is and freaking out because it has lost reality this is the nub of reality so the reality of man's sinful state
20:49 -  can never be perceived merely by self-knowledge because self will always disguise it self will always give it a better interpretation more honoring and flattering to itself it will not see it as evil the totality and inclusiveness of Adam's sin this issue of depravity this
21:10 -  Adamic taint to which we are all subject and the consequent depravity of all is an issue that is only truly made known in the cross to avoid the cross is to lose any prospect of the true estimation of our condition in that he takes our place it is decided what our place is the cross of christ
21:38 -  itself and the condemnation of human sin that it represents reveals the objectivity and total depravity of our sinful state how righteous Paul Paul says that the gospel is there the revealing of the righteousness of God because it could not have been revealed by anything less
21:58 -  the cross is the ultimate revelation of the righteousness of God and the truth of our condition that would never have been revealed except by it and God knows that and therefore he did not stop short of providing it or else we would have been locked into a subjective place
22:21 -  of self-esteem by which we have we would never have seen the truth of our condition nor have remitted it the cross reveals the truth and how far God had to go in meeting that condition so those who avoid the cross as judaism has done and even if christians have done
22:45 -  by diminishing its reality and allowing its athletes to wear diamond study crosses who are making 50 million a year whatever they make in immoral sums of money just to play sport and where the rap artist wear the cross madonna wears the cross
23:08 -  because we have provided an environment conducive that allows that kind of what's the word travesty that's God's judgment on the church that the cross has become a popular symbol by people who are involved in the vilest forms of sin and have become our culture
23:32 -  heroes and whom we are rewarding with millions any single madonna tour reaps 70 to 80 million dollars of clear profit why does she enjoy the adulation of the millions willing to pay to see this slinky to see this slinky thing who is learning kabbalah and doesn't know God and wears a little red
24:01 -  thing around her wrist as if that a null sin in the worst forms of idolatry and wearing the cross heavy on that bosom is God's judgment upon the church that has not maintained the the appropriate understanding of what that cross represents has come back to haunt us in its misuse the cross
24:27 -  reveals the holiness of God and the depravity of man as no other single act of God is calculated to bring it to reveal it have we esteemed it rightly we are including myself to preach about it and to fall short of its appropriation and the deep
24:51 -  sobering of it is to compound the sin we would be better off to shut our mouths but now that we're speaking along these lines we have the greater obligation to honor that cross and you have the greater obligation to pray for the men who are so speaking
25:10 -  because the enemy will go out of his way to bring them down explicitly as being the foremost threat to their darkness and if they can bring down the man who is the expository of the cross by some transgression and failing of his own what a triumph the kingdom of darkness that you have
25:29 -  allowed by your failure to uphold these men in your prayer and in your intercessions because you're too dull to realize that they are the object of the enemy's severest attacks and will bring temptations at the moments when they are weakest and and most reduced by their own exhaustion
25:46 -  in God's labors and then when they fall you cluck your tongue and even secretly enjoy their fall because by that means you have been exalted we're all indicted we're all in something together we have not recognized the war that we are in for truth and for righteousness and again against
26:08 -  and transgression our own failure to pray is a sinful neglect we have not serious understood seriously what's at stake so this is a great conclusion the totality and inclusiveness inclusiveness of adam's sin
26:31 -  and the consequent the gravity of all is an issue that is only true that truly made known at the cross in that he takes our place it is decided what our place is the cross of christ itself the con and the condemnation of human sin that represents reveals the objectivity and total
26:48 -  depravity of our sinful state jews are in a most despicable condition because they have rejected this revelation of the cross and only the cross would have revealed not only the truth of their condition the holiness of God and even the triune tri triune triune nature of God for there's the
27:15 -  son crying out to the father why have you forsaken me who is giving his life by the eternal spirit as a sacrifice unto God for sin the the triune God is revealed up the cross most powerfully as in no other place as is the revelation of depravity out of the holiness of
27:34 -  God all encompassed in one epochal event that we have allowed to fall into disuse and make of it a parody Jesus christ superstar the cross of dangling around the necks of the most vile sinners shows how the church is not upheld the center of its own faith
27:56 -  that Paul begins in the book of romans i'm not ashamed of the gospel i i i determined not to know anything but christ and him crucified you see how singular a passion is this issue of the cross for Paul the apostle
28:11 -  and how much less it is for us that need that on this ground needs to be regained this article on sin devotes considerable attention to the first sin of adam and eve because in it are all the constituent elements of all sin anything that's given at the first is
28:32 -  always revelatory of something that is ultimate so we need really to ponder that let me read a part of this that she eve had exceeded to her his assault upon God's ferocity maybe women are more prone to this i don't know but Paul gives this reasons Paul cites eve's culpability as the reason why
28:58 -  women are not to be given the place of a third in the church that by their nature they are susceptible to temptation of this particular kind to doubt God's veracity she gave to the temple the place that belonged to God only she accepted the most blasphemous assault upon the
29:19 -  integrity of God she coveted for herself divine prerogatives in her willingness to parlay with the tenter in her failure to meet with hara against the suggestions and in her acquiescence there is disclosed the process that preceded the act of eating the forbidden fruit here we have
29:38 -  the origin of sin and we are pointed to its true character sin does not originate in overt action it proceeds from the heart and mind the poverty of heart registered itself in the transgression of the commandment adam and eve became first estranged from God and then they committed the
29:56 -  actual transgression they were drawn away of their own lust and enticed how this could happen in their case is the mystery of the origin of sin there's some we need to contemplate this what's the disposition of heart that allows itself to be enticed and is not horrified by the suggestion
30:13 -  that the tenter is making how is it that we can have erotic dreams in the early morning hours and not awaken from the horror of it but even allow ourselves to low back into that half-sleep half-awake state that we might have more reveries of that sexual current
30:31 -  i'm ashamed that i'm not horrified and don't awaken in the horror but allow myself to fall back into that slumber because of the erotic things that it arouses something is wanting in my own moral acquiescence that should be horrified she was not horrified and where was
30:56 -  adam when he's allowing his wife to carry on this conversation why didn't he shut her up in the same way that i do chart why didn't he act as he should in his authority because his wife is already going beyond where she should she is transgressing and allowing himself to be silent
31:15 -  he's condoning and make himself one with that transgression that's why it's the judgment of adam and eve so here's the anatomy of sin you guys and any sin that we perform has the same auspices and the same permissive condition by which they they fell we need to be instructed by
31:37 -  he's despised and rejected of men and men of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten with God and
31:54 -  afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace what should have been rightly required of us was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep without exception everyone have got a spray we have turned
32:19 -  everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed he was afflicted and he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his sheers is dumb so he opens not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment
32:39 -  who shall declare his generation for he was cut off and out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he was and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no
32:55 -  violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and when you shall make his soul an offering for your sin he shall see his seed and he shall belong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of
33:16 -  the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities lord great son of God who bore this my God of what should rightly have come upon us what shall we say to you
33:46 -  you are more than any man there was nothing left of any beauty that we should desire you stricken smitten of Gods your face splattered my God with blood and with spit naked and open to such abuse my God that should never have come upon a holy son
34:08 -  on the abandonment of your father you bore the stripes you were the ultimate sin offering and we have all transgressed we are everyone guilty in going our own way unwilling even to acknowledge the truth of our condition
34:28 -  thank you lord what shall we say my God for this condition so pervasive for all mankind without exception shared in that sin God forbid we should add to your suffering now God forbid that we should crucify the son of God a flesh a flesh God forbid that we should add my God in any way to what you
34:53 -  have already borne by our own light regard to the truth of our condition so may God know may we be humbled may may we see may we understand
35:11 -  the evil my God that your father's holy name required to be required at your expense and that you were willing you didn't let that come pass you drank from it to its drinks and then we ask you forgive this blood for our own failure and that of the church
35:33 -  and that of the church to uphold this reality which is at the heart of all reality and we're mocked by madonna's cross and all of these athletes with their diamond studded things as if it's a piece of jewelry and a little cheapy that anyone can string around his neck
35:56 -  or put up in the architecture of the church but that's about as close as we come to it or know of it forgive us lord forgive us lord help us afresh with real revelation my God that you were wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities put something lord deep in our
36:22 -  heart in a man this truth this reality lord that will temper our every conversation our whole demeanor my God has got to be affected by this apical once and for all event thank you lord oh precious God without this foundation what are we lord
36:47 -  lord glib facile anxious cheap church services programs for the benefit of men their pleasure their self-esteem there's no basis for our esteem at all lord this was required of you because of our of the truth of our condition
37:09 -  truly that there's no good thing my God in man and so we bless you precious faithful obedience so unto death and that this death was pleasing to the father who laid it upon you or you would not have been
37:26 -  resurrected that he raised you out of a sealed tomb a sealed cave guarded by the bravest of the brave of these gentiles centurions lest your body would have been stolen and the end would have been worse than the beginning despite all that you were raised
37:48 -  from that death in the statement of the father's approval of the efficacy of that sacrifice thank you lord thank you holy father thank you for raising Jesus up as the approval of his sacrifice that we might be justified by his death thank you lord
38:11 -  thank you my God lord precious God great father holy thank you my God for this piece of history this act give us a hatred of inequity when we see what it requires that we would not even dare to allow the appearance of it seeing what it required
38:39 -  thank you that we would love righteousness seeing what it required that we would take your admonition to be holy as you are holy singing what it required come lord and restore your fear we heed your words by whose stripes we have been healed thank you
39:03 -  bring this revelation to your people Israel we have suffered my God so long all these millennia for the want of this understanding we're still suffering we've rejected your provision and therefore what is the covering for our sin going to the synagogue on yom kippur
39:28 -  and fasting for one day and doing mitzvoth and good deeds is that a a suitable equivalent for the blood of your son we are open to the enemy we're a target to suffer havoc and ruin and devastation because we have not the covering we have not known we rejected my God your great
39:50 -  provision and the church has been guilty in not persuading us of its truth though you have said this gospel is the power of God and the salvation to the jews first we've not gone we've allowed them to languish in their susceptibility to the attack of the evil one
40:10 -  because they are uncovered and their little beanie their yarmulke does not do it but our transgressions are upon our heads my God only your blood would have saved us and it is an offense to our jewish sensibility it has not been commended to us by those who know
40:31 -  about it so mercy lord mercy lord lord awaken the church to its mandate and its ability to perform it by the grace of your spirit
40:50 -  and to demonstrate the power of this foolish message to everyone who believes will believe to the jew first and also to the greek their blood in a sense lord is upon our hands our indifference and our neglect leaves them susceptible to every attack of evil
41:16 -  we have not made your cross known we have not told them that this is the yom kippur that is God's great atonement and that you gave us 40 years to consider it and when we still did not consider it you destroyed your temple you destroyed your altar you scattered your priesthood
41:36 -  there was no possible continuation of biblical sacrifice after that we were left with our sins and have been left with our sins since and are in that condition to this day and their blood is on our hands so my God so my God help us in your mercy help these people in their ignorance
42:02 -  who oppose themselves in their own ignorance and think that the dictums provided by their rabbis has equal weight with your word and with what isaiah says in chapter 53 which is never read in a single synagogue service its meaning is too clear
42:22 -  woe unto them who oppose the truth and unrighteousness and hinder its promulgation for those who would be saved by it leading the world in abortion in incest in vilest forms of
42:47 -  obscene self-indulgence making the films the plays the music the rap my God my God what a hole we are digging for ourselves who are called to be a nation of priests and a light unto the world and promulgate the world's filth and leaders in it in our
43:06 -  ingenuity surely we deserve my God such judgment and those judgments will come and are now even presently coming save out of it we pray a remnant upon whom your eye is set and by them my God restore and redeem your nation that they might be a holy people
