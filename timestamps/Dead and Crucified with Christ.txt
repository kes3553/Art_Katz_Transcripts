Dead and Crucified with Christ

00:00 -  It's too holy a thing for a man to contrive, this point of death and resurrection, beyond doctrine, as event. It's something that God has to perform. I had one thought, it was about Lazarus himself. We don't give him sufficient consideration. What did it mean for him to be the
00:56 -  instrument through which God's glory was revealed? This was the consummating event of Jesus' ministry on earth. Once Lazarus came forth from death, it was finished. The things were set in motion, which resulted in the death of Jesus himself. It was necessary then for the nation
01:39 -  that one man die. This kind of precedent could not be allowed to continue. Precedent, P-R-E-C-E-D-E-N-T, this example could not be allowed to continue. Resurrection is the ultimate offense against all that is religious. When you demonstrate that, you bring the fury of hell on
02:26 -  your head. Far better to only consent to the doctrine than to demonstrate it. That demonstration is intolerable in the world, and especially to religion itself. We stand tonight at a dangerous threshold, a Jordan of crossing over. And I will not blame you if you choose not to
03:12 -  cross. You're not required. You're only invited. But I want you to know that it's a real crossing. And here's the thought that I have. Can anyone really call Jesus Lord, who is not totally dependent upon God for his very life, who is actually bound up in the rock like Lazarus in grave
04:01 -  clothes, with your face covered. You can't see. You can't speak. Your hands bound. You can't do. Your feet bound. You can't move until he speaks. When we have come to that, he is the Lord over all. Lazarus was willing without explanation. That's suffering. And if it's a death without suffering,
04:46 -  it's not a death. It's a mock. It's a game. He had no explanation. Of why his friend did not come. Terrible disappointment unto death without any assurance of anything. Even his sister said, he will rise again on the last day. They had the correct doctrine,
05:28 -  that they did not have the correct understanding of Jesus himself, who is the resurrection and life, and can call us forth out of our tomb at any time. Isn't that what Paul says? We are dead and hid with Christ in God until his life is revealed. Then our life is revealed also. Because that is
06:09 -  our life. We have no other. And it is revealed unto glory. The resurrection life of God is the glory of God. It is the power of God. And this is what must be demonstrated at the end. This is a devotional daily reading by Andrew Murray. And on April 21st, which I believe is the date of
07:09 -  Israel's anniversary as a nation, there is this reading. Christ, our righteousness. Let that sink into your hearing. Because what is our life? But the deepest necessity to buy it, to establish our own righteousness. To make Christ your righteousness is sheerest death.
08:00 -  This is why he was crucified. This was his threat to the Jewish nation. A nation determined to establish its own righteousness, by its own merit, by its own ability. To take that privilege away from a man is to ask his death. We can suffer anything else from God, but don't let him take that.
08:47 -  That's the death. Christ, our righteousness. To forsake our own righteousness, the establishing of our own justification for our own being, is 10,000 deaths for the Jew and for the German, especially. And he quotes the verse from Romans 3.24. Justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
09:50 -  This deserves days of consideration together. His grace. What is the phrase that Paul most frequently uses? In Christ. In Christ. In Christ. In Him I live and move and help my being. And yet we continue to congratulate Paul for his courage, his ability, his faithfulness, and have missed the entire point.
10:50 -  The glory of Paul is Christ. All that Jesus would have done had he continued to live on the earth and serve on the earth, was equally performed by Paul. For it was Jesus who continued to live, no longer in his own body, but in Paul, for Paul was in him, and the life of Paul was the life of Christ.
11:38 -  His wisdom, his speaking, his understanding, it's the apostolic glory, because it's the apostolic life, the resurrection life of Christ, totally in possession of the man, who can say with complete literalness, for me to live is Christ. What hinders us also to say that, and also so to live?
12:26 -  One thing only, we are not as totally yielded to Christ as Paul. We don't want to be dead and hid in Christ, until his life is revealed. We don't want to be justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
13:05 -  1 Corinthians chapter 1, verse 24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God. God has committed all things unto his Son. The fullness of the Godhead is in him bodily.
13:46 -  All that pertains to life and Godliness is in him. He is the power of God. He is the wisdom of God.
14:06 -  We will not have either of these, except to the degree that we have him, or more correctly to the degree that he has us. Listen to the way I'm speaking. Don't miss the point in this.
14:32 -  God is not just proclaiming, he is demonstrating. Do you think I prepared this message while you were out eating? It was hopeless, too complicated, too deep, too significant.
14:55 -  I could only trust, but listen to the logic of what is unfolding. I myself am astonished. This is the Lord's sense.
15:14 -  But Art, it sounds so much like you. What do you want, an echo chamber? Of course it's going to sound like me, but the life of it, the vitality, the content, is him.
15:52 -  And why does God do it that way? Verse 29 of the same chapter, that no flesh should glory in his presence.
16:11 -  You are wise not to congratulate me for anything of the ministry of these days. It's not mine.
16:26 -  It's his. That no flesh should glory in his presence. But of him are you in Christ Jesus,
16:40 -  who of God has made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, all. That according as it is written, he that glories, let him glory in God.
17:03 -  Can you imagine a church like this? But it means the end of your ambition. When you think you should be married,
17:24 -  and to whom you think you'll be married, is finished. It's no longer your privilege to consider that.
17:36 -  You're dead. You have no rights. No future.
17:41 -  No hope, except what is given. This is the Gospel. Can you trust him?
18:11 -  And will it be all the same to you, whether there is a husband or not? That's the question.
18:25 -  If you're to say for me to live is Christ. He is so totally your life, so totally your satisfaction,
18:39 -  so totally your purpose, that if he insists that you have a husband, insist,
18:52 -  then you will reluctantly agree, because the Lord said so. But you have no desire for yourself.
19:08 -  This is not a Christianity for the multitudes, but the end thereof is glorious. If God gives the husband,
19:25 -  that is blessed and heavenly. What is it to be priestly? To come to the place where it's all the same.
19:41 -  To have or not to have? To serve or not to serve? To be in the rock or to be out of it?
19:50 -  To be in the rock or out of it? In sickness or in health? In life or in death?
20:01 -  If it glorifies God? Let's try and do something with this here. Most Christians have a faith in justification,
20:26 -  but they fail sadly, because they do not know, do not in full faith yield themselves to Christ,
20:39 -  to maintain his life in them. They know the God who justifies the unGodly, but they do not yet know the God who quickens the dead,
20:58 -  in whose life alone there is strength and fullness of blessing. So live in him and to grow up in him, that in all things you might be the head.
21:21 -  To count all things but lost for Christ, was the key of Paul's life, and it must be ours.
21:34 -  If we ought to share fully in the power of his resurrection, how little the church understands this. Christ claims the whole heart and the whole life.
21:55 -  This is the law of the kingdom. It's unchangeable. All things lost
22:04 -  for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus Christ, to live as those who are not their own, but wholly his.
22:35 -  On the first night the Lord spoke to us about entering the veil. He bid us enter. He had rent the veil over the holiest place,
22:56 -  and we were invited to enter by the blood of the Lamb, a new and living way. And by faith we came.
23:10 -  And yet for some of us it was a disappointment. Though we came by faith, we did not seem to experience the sense of God's presence. What fail?
23:29 -  Had he mocked us? Did he bid us to come and we came by faith, and yet did not sense the joy of his presence?
23:44 -  What's the problem? I think the Lord wants to show it through this, that though his veil is rent,
23:57 -  our veil is not. There's a veil in many of us that covers still the secret heart,
24:09 -  a very tender tissue that has not yet been torn. And we want to protect it and to keep it, because it's painful to be endangered.
24:29 -  And this keeps us from the deepest intimate union with God and with each other. We have a nice fellowship.
24:44 -  It's pleasant, but it's not yet glorious, not yet intimate,
24:53 -  not yet open, from spirit to spirit. There's a veil,
25:03 -  not from God, but from man, that has not been ripped.
25:09 -  It's the secret life, the self-life, that we want to preserve
25:17 -  and still be Christian. Thosa calls it the veil of our fleshly fallen nature living on,
25:39 -  uncrucified and unrepudiated, unacknowledged, undismissed. It has never been brought to the cross,
26:02 -  and it is an effective block to our spiritual life. It is a tissue that is made up of the self-life, self-righteousness,
26:24 -  self-pity, self-confidence, self-sufficiency,
26:30 -  self-love, and so on. Self, self, self, self.
26:37 -  You know what the remarkable thing is? This is not just for the carnal and the materialistic. There's no place where self has greater opportunity
26:50 -  to be established and to be strengthened than in the religious life. There it disguises itself
27:06 -  and purports to be for Christ and to do for him and to be for him, while all the while it is being secretly strengthened and established.
27:26 -  He says it can live on unrebuked at the very altar of God. It can fight for the faith of the reformers and about grace
27:48 -  and be strengthened by these very efforts. This is the ultimate paradox. Even the desire to be crucified with Christ
28:12 -  by our own effort ironically strengthens self. There must be a work of God.
28:26 -  The same God that rent the veil from the temple needs to rent ours. From top to bottom. It's a work of God, of destruction.
28:46 -  But will we invite him to do it? Will we allow the cross to do its deadly work? If we don't experience this as suffering,
29:06 -  we mock God and we make this the worst of all deceptions by playing with the theme of crucifixion
29:23 -  and still keeping our self-life at the same time. It's painful for God to touch this. And to deny that is to deny the cross
29:40 -  and to make it no death at all. And yet this is what the cross is designed to perform if we are to come free
30:02 -  and fully to have our life in him. We must not be satisfied with the doctrine about it but invite the experience of it
30:21 -  that this work might be done in truth. It's a deadly work but it results in a newness of life.
30:39 -  From it comes the resurrection and the glory for Jesus, for Paul, for Israel, for us. We have come to a moment in the divine history
31:04 -  when something is being required of us that is ultimate. The work of the cross in fact and no mere satisfaction with the doctrine alone.
31:27 -  Something must be rent and torn if we are to move Israel to jealousy, if they are to see the glory and the power,
31:42 -  the Shekinah glory and the radiance of God through those who are actually coming to them out of his presence for there is no veil that separates them
32:04 -  from God's part or their part. The deepest relationship with God and with each other.
32:17 -  It's glory but there's a suffering that precedes it and that's the point where we are now.
32:30 -  Jesus gave himself up freely as an offering without spot to God. This cannot be compelled. It cannot be required of you.
32:47 -  It must be freely given to invite the work of the cross in your life. And this is what I am seeing in these days
33:03 -  by the preaching of this message on Ezekiel 37 in the finest churches in America in Nashville, Tennessee
33:17 -  or in New Zealand. Impressive churches. There the work of the cross was most powerful
33:29 -  because they had the most to give up. Their success based on their own ability which was impressive
33:41 -  but it was not glorious and I watched them go down like dead men.
33:50 -  They didn't just fall on the floor they dug into the floor to give up the best of what they are
34:03 -  to obtain all that he is. That's the long and the short of it. I didn't make this up.
34:14 -  This is of him. That it might be through him that it might be to him
34:22 -  to whom be glory forever. And what will you be after such a death and resurrection? An automaton?
34:37 -  A mechanical robot? Under the dictate of God? Or more truly yourself than you have ever been?
34:55 -  In the full life and power of God but in which you cannot boast except in him.
35:10 -  For this people God has reserved his holiest work for they alone can be trusted with it. Even to speak his word
35:30 -  as very God himself. And this alone will bring Israel from its grave. God didn't need us.
35:45 -  The God who brooded over the chaos and spoke let there be light, let there be this, let there be that and there was.
35:56 -  Could he not have done the same over Israel? Yes. But he chose to speak it through us
36:08 -  as one body in a true corporate unity that is more than some ecumenical accomplishment.
36:23 -  More than some ecumenical design. Religious. That itself is the work of the cross.
36:37 -  Are you such a people tonight? One people, one body? Of one mind, of one heart, of one soul?
36:48 -  One agreement? One speaking? No.
36:56 -  There are pockets of individualism. Self-will. Opinion.
37:07 -  We're not yet that people and nor can we be it except by that work
37:18 -  the cross. To everything that is selfish, vain, self-will rebellious, opinionated
37:35 -  God has got to deal that we might be that one people and speak that one word
37:49 -  in that one agreement that makes it the word of life to a nation that is completely dead
38:04 -  and cannot help itself and waits for that word alone through such a people.
38:17 -  So the Lord is inviting you. How far are you willing to go with him? What is the extent of your intention?
38:37 -  To be an impressive fellowship? Or a glorious? And now the Lord waits for you.
38:53 -  Your word, your willingness to invite his work for the rending of your veil.
39:08 -  It's a pity that you have to die. I myself am impressed with you. I would not have asked more
39:23 -  and find you impressive and delightful. But we're called to more. In him.
39:51 -  So settle it with the Lord. How far are you willing to go? And the giving up of your own life,
40:08 -  your own future, your own hope, your own desire,
40:17 -  your own intention, even for God. And bring everything into death.
40:28 -  And trust that because he lives you will live also. And out of that life to call Israel to life is our calling
40:45 -  for his glory. Amen. Amen.
41:28 -  Amen. Amen. Amen.
42:58 -  Amen. Amen. Amen.
44:28 -  Amen. Amen. Thank you, my God.
45:05 -  Receive our bodies as a living sacrifice. Nothing withheld. Yours entirely.
45:30 -  Thank you. Thank you. Shabbat shalom.
45:48 -  Thank you. Thank you. That last thing that we clutch
46:05 -  and will not give up. Take it now. Let your cross do its work.
46:14 -  Have faith. Have faith. Have faith.
46:20 -  Have faith. Take it now. Let your cross do its work.
46:27 -  Let your cross do its work. Have for yourself sons and daughters who are wholly yours,
46:40 -  whose lives are not their own. Fill them with your glory. Let your radiant light shine.
46:56 -  Let Israel be saved by this demonstration of the life of its God
47:07 -  through these vessels. Bless them in this holy transaction
47:17 -  that is not to be taken back once and for all. Possess us to the uttermost.
47:28 -  Crucified with Christ that we might be raised with him when we come up off of this floor
47:43 -  and from this place of death to a newness of life that is no longer self-conscious,
47:55 -  spiritual in the self-conscious way, totally free, flowing by the love of God
48:09 -  through his life, to each other, the true koinonia
48:17 -  and the true witness. Hallelujah. Korah shamala makiliya roh kashamalai.
48:28 -  Thank you for the cross that it works, that it avails.
48:36 -  It's not just a symbol, a metaphor, it works
48:49 -  unto death for all who will yield unto it, that they might be crucified with Christ
49:01 -  and thereby raised with him. Hallelujah. Work your work, Lord.
49:10 -  Even now, break up in the deeps. Loose these children
49:19 -  from powers that have victimized them, exploited them, intimidated them,
49:28 -  out of fear, out of the necessity to establish themselves, to be found acceptable by men.
49:40 -  Destroy it, that they might be free. Call them forth out of their tomb
49:49 -  into life fully for God. Hallelujah.
49:57 -  Shamak. Roshamak. Thank you.
