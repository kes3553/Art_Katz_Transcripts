True Repentance

00:00 -  for the kingdom of God is at hand. These words, spoken first by
00:11 -  the Baptists John and Jesus, are inexorably joined. Always.
00:27 -  You cannot speak of the kingdom without speaking of repentance. There's no entry into the kingdom without repentance. So we have the reality of the kingdom in exact proportion
00:44 -  as we have authentic repentance. And it's not a once and for all repentance. It's a continual state of being.
01:02 -  More rightly, a state of death. For true repentance is the awesome acknowledgement of God. As he in fact is and not as we thought him to be.
01:20 -  And before that holy presence, no man dare lift his head. Job was described by God himself as being outstanding,
01:34 -  the foremost of all men. God boasted on him and yet at the end of God's dealings
01:48 -  with him the same man cries out I've heard of you with the hearing of my ear
02:00 -  but now my eye sees and I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.
02:14 -  This is classic. This is definitive. And we fall grievously short of this repentance.
02:27 -  And for that reason the kingdom does not come. It's the ultimate expression of God in glory and requires the most profound coming down of man before it.
02:47 -  What does it mean to repent in dust and ashes? What does that symbolically represent having gone under the ground in burial?
03:05 -  There's no place for me other than to be buried. Now that I have glimpsed you as you are there's no place for me as man but in death.
03:23 -  And God received that statement from Job and he said pray for your friends, your comforters for my anger is kindled against them
03:41 -  for you have not spoken as my servant Job has spoken I am continually leaving bewildered saints in my path and I'm remembering one occasion in America
04:03 -  an outstandingly successful fellowship and you know what my message for them was? You think you have it all together?
04:14 -  You haven't even begun to speak as Job's comforters have spoken which is the most sublime spirituality
04:24 -  in the holy scripture It was not appropriate for Job but the statements in themselves
04:38 -  are sublimely spiritual and despite that God says my anger is kindled against you
04:49 -  however spiritually insightful you were deep in your understanding you still failed
05:01 -  but there's only one statement that I can receive from man I have not spoken I abhor myself
05:12 -  and repent in dust and ashes Is there a nation in the world today for which the issue of repentance
05:24 -  is more important than Germany? You will live continually under the shadow of the historic past
05:42 -  will you ever be washed from the stain of the holocaust? and yet there's continual reference to repentance
05:58 -  and I've had opportunity to observe it even most recently on the conference on prayer for Israel in Berlin
06:11 -  there's a continual theme of repentance toward the Jew and toward Israel on the part of the German church
06:23 -  you would think that as a Jewish believer my spirit would rejoice you would think that as a Jewish believer
06:30 -  my spirit would rejoice but the more that I heard these appeals to repentance and witnessed the character of it
06:50 -  the more uncomfortable I felt in the inner man something is wrong with this kind of repentance one of the evidences of which
07:01 -  is the continual need to reiterate it how often are we going to feel sorry for the same thing?
07:17 -  that it needs again and again to be restated that it needs again and again to be restated maybe the problem is that we have not
07:28 -  rightly understood repentance and that feeling sorry falls short of it I got the impression that what these
07:44 -  German saints wanted was psychological relief they came to the conference
07:52 -  in the hope of it and needed so desperately to experience it there's a word for this in psychology
08:08 -  they wanted catharsis a relief a relief for a burden of guilt
08:14 -  a relief a relief for a burden of guilt that evidently had not been met in any other way
08:26 -  and so I began to ponder this before the Lord and here is my essay
08:38 -  notes on the issue of German repentance toward Israel what's wrong with this kind of repentance?
08:50 -  maybe it has to do with not rightly understanding the issue of guilt
09:00 -  that assumes that Germany is the cause of the Holocaust against the Jew
09:10 -  Germany is the cause of the Holocaust if that's your understanding you'll never be relieved
09:23 -  because it misses the truth of the Holocaust itself the magnitude of that tragedy
09:33 -  is beyond the issue of German complicity and if we were students
09:45 -  of God's dealings in history with Israel we would be able to distinguish
09:55 -  between the judgments that God brings and the rod that he employs
10:09 -  Nazi Germany was the rod of God's chastisement but the cause was
10:20 -  Jewish sin itself historic and present the sins of the fathers
10:34 -  never recognized or acknowledged the cries of the prophets
10:42 -  never heard nor repented for and the sin continues
10:50 -  and gathers its weight and though God may deter in bringing his judgment
11:00 -  he's not under obligation to bring it immediately in a cause and effect situation
11:12 -  but bring it he will in his own time for his own purpose
11:20 -  that's even in Germany and the kind of influence that we expressed in our history here
11:38 -  our substitution of German civilization for God's messianic answer encouraging German rationalism
11:55 -  that is offended by the supernatural God that had its final expression in God is dead theology
12:06 -  and in the Jewish reform Judaism this is more than I can say
12:16 -  at the moment God's judgments are always in proportion
12:24 -  to our sins and when Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem
12:34 -  and when Eichmann was in court in Jerusalem this prosecutor
12:52 -  his name was Gideon Hausner he writes this in his memoirs a man's sin or his crimes
13:03 -  may go for a long time unrecognized and unattended but there must come a time
13:15 -  when the culprit is apprehended and the righteous judgment inflicted
13:25 -  so had it come for Eichmann many years after the end of the Nazi time
13:36 -  as the scripture says be assured your sins will find you out it found us out in the Holocaust
13:52 -  and why was Germany the rod of our chastisement because
13:59 -  we so celebrated German culture there was no segment of the German
14:07 -  population more enthusiastic for Goethe, Schiller, Fichte and Hegel we could not believe that a Hitler
14:23 -  could come to power not in the land of such celebrated civilization and culture
14:33 -  this has got to be a momentary thing this too shall pass but it did not pass
14:43 -  and became our judgment so to feel guilty as the cause of
14:51 -  the Holocaust is a false guilt one that God would not have you to assume
15:07 -  does that mean that Germany is completely absolved of all responsibility not at all
15:17 -  you are still the rod of God's chastisement and the willing rod and for that there needs to be acknowledgement and repentance
15:33 -  but not for a falsely assumed guilt there is a deeper sin than the Holocaust for which repentance God still waits
15:52 -  and therefore he will not honor your false repentance which you are only wanting for your psychological relief the German sin is identically the same
16:14 -  as the Jewish sin for which the Holocaust is the judgment and what is that sin
16:28 -  it is the betrayal of the true faith by both Christians and Jews in taking our inheritance
16:40 -  and domesticating it and making of it a Sunday or a Saturday culture a bourgeois accommodation
17:02 -  that would not in any way threaten our real interests and allow us a modicum of religiosity that is the sin
17:22 -  for which repentance God waits the taking of the apostolic faith and the making of it
17:34 -  some kind of addendum to our busy life not just in our liberal Christianity but in our Orthodox
17:53 -  it is nothing less than the misuse of God for man's own purposes and man's own ends it is ultimate idolatry
18:09 -  because it is performed in the name of God and thinks it is even doing him service and so to seek psychological relief through repentance
18:28 -  is to continue in that same sin we are the object of our religious life our relief, our satisfaction, our happiness
18:42 -  it has always been and its character yet remains even in its best charismatic forms
18:54 -  we have not seen this and repented for the misuse of God
19:06 -  in the framing of a religious life in which our personal and selfish interests are foremost it has no interest in a kingdom come
19:21 -  it certainly doesn't want to experience the inconvenience let alone be an object of opposition or persecution better to supply a religious accommodation
19:39 -  and sanctify the purposes of the state and give its imperialist ambitions a little religious aura this is not only Germany's sin
20:05 -  it is the sin of Christian nations everywhere and the decline of Great Britain is the evidence the land of Spurgeon and George Whitfield
20:25 -  the great missionaries is the land of the rock punk culture and its celebrated Christianity
20:39 -  has a funeral for Princess Diana who is a jet set princess of the worst kind such is the bankruptcy of British Christianity
21:05 -  I waited for the British church to express its profession to protest the celebration of this pagan and her illicit relationship with a Muslim prince
21:29 -  not a word not a statement even in its prophetic publications
21:39 -  there is a repentance for which God is waiting but it's not for our relief it's for His
21:53 -  for we have offended against Him since time memorial and what rubs the salt into the wound is not to offend against Him as pagans
22:06 -  but as Jews and as Christians who share together the same mentality of a religious convenience
22:22 -  that serves the purposes of man and is entirely indifferent to the purposes of God ultimate idolatry
22:34 -  performed in the name of God Himself and still continuing in seeking this cathartic relief
22:48 -  at Israel's expense and the fact that this relief is never obtained and needs again and again to be repeated
23:01 -  shows how questionable are its motives and how unrecognized
23:11 -  the church wants to repent toward Israel I'll give you a good reason your failure to have made known
23:24 -  to the Israel in your midst the reality of its own Messiah and God in whom you professed to believe
23:44 -  allowing them to coexist side by side to have their own religious institutions as if somehow the synagogue
23:57 -  is a valid religious reality and not a statement of continuing Jewish apostasy from Christ
24:12 -  and not a permanent confirmation of the Jewish decline of the Messiah of Christ
24:24 -  is there any nation in the world that has had a longer Jewish presence than Germany
24:34 -  and has so little affected them by your witness we had a direct mandate in scripture
24:48 -  this gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first
24:58 -  and then also to the Greek God's priority God's order
25:06 -  which we consciously circumvented because the Jews are so intimidating and so bright
25:20 -  and intellectual and professional and their lives seem so well ordered
25:28 -  better than ours how dare we tell them that they are lost without our Christ in whose name
25:36 -  Jews have suffered historically in Germany such an obedience to the requirement
25:46 -  of Jesus as Lord has got to appear to Jews as being utmost arrogance
25:59 -  who would dare perform it only one that one who is truly
26:09 -  repentant and broken and has so descended into death which is what repentance is
26:23 -  a burial of the inadequate wickedness a burial of the inadequate religious life
26:34 -  and a coming forth in a newness of life that does not need Jewish approval
26:48 -  and is willing to bear the offense of the gospel itself in that you have failed
27:02 -  you have not maintained an apostolic witness to that people whom God has placed in your midst
27:12 -  it's the statement of your failure the betrayal of the kingdom and it's gone on historically
27:24 -  and never been recognized as sin and therefore continues
27:31 -  still the scandal of the Jew is something that polite Christianity cannot afford
27:49 -  and if German society has been anything it's been polite it's more important to be polite than to be radical
28:03 -  no wonder Nietzsche said God is dead he showed no evidence in polite German Christianity
28:13 -  for a Christianity that is polite is not Christian it's a contradiction in terms
28:24 -  the very nature of the faith is radical and will always bring upon itself reproach it's a reproach for which
28:34 -  German Christians were unwilling of course Paul said he would wish himself accursed for his brethren's sake
28:50 -  that they might know Christ of course that's Paul that's not us
28:58 -  that's a man speaking as a Jew in his fleshly ethnic identification with his own people
29:08 -  of course we could not be expected to have a burden like that really?
29:18 -  well I want to raise a question is Paul crying out in Romans 9 out of his Jewishness?
29:29 -  what he is in the natural or is he crying out as an apostle and that the grief he is expressing
29:39 -  is not some ethnic identification but that of the high priest and the apostle of the faith himself
29:51 -  if that's true then there's a possibility for an identification
29:59 -  with the Jewish people that is beyond sentiment it is the deep heart cry
30:09 -  of God himself for which we would be willing to forfeit our own salvation
30:20 -  did Paul have it because he was a Jew? did Paul have it because he was a Jew? or because he was an apostle?
30:36 -  I'm not talking about his title I'm talking about his apostolic union with God
30:45 -  his repentance was authentic it was not a little feeling sorry there was a man who went down into death
31:01 -  and everything that he celebrated as a man and religiously died with him
31:11 -  all his categories went into death and he was raised to newness of life
31:23 -  there's no one in whom the resurrected Christ had greater continuation than the apostle Paul
31:34 -  that's what he meant when he said for me to live as Christ what's our excuse? what did Paul enjoy that is not available to us?
31:52 -  what expression of the resurrection life which bears the grief of God for Israel and the courage to express it
32:06 -  is not available to us also everything depends on our repentance
32:16 -  expressed in our baptism was it a burial? the only thing that our humanity deserves
32:28 -  for in the flesh is no good thing at all or was it a getting wet performing a religious obligation
32:42 -  by those who did not recognize that baptism is a burial and if they knew it even now
32:54 -  would not desire it how shall we expect apostolic reality from a church
33:08 -  that is still alive unto itself and has never repented unto death
33:19 -  and wants only relief and is itself the object of its own consideration
33:31 -  I'm not arguing now for a form of baptism because my preference of course is for the
33:43 -  full immersion as burial but there are untold millions who have gone down that way
33:55 -  and came up out of that water no more changed than those who were merely sprinkled
34:07 -  what was their intention? certainly not death not burial
34:14 -  for they were not persuaded that there was anything about them that required so radical a thing
34:24 -  they are after all nice people who need only to be reformed or improved
34:36 -  not buried you know what I'm saying? the Jew finds us out
34:45 -  and has always revealed the condition of the church even Luther's condition
34:55 -  there is something about the unbelieving Jew that reveals our secret heart and shows us where in fact we are
35:09 -  not only with regard to them but with regard to God a really repentant German Christian
35:29 -  will tell Israel their sins and Jacob their transgressions that's what we are told in Isaiah
35:45 -  do not hold back lift your voice like a trumpet tell Israel of its sin
35:57 -  and Jacob of its transgressions and that the Holocaust was not some momentary historic aberration
36:06 -  but the calculated judgment of God promised in scripture in Deuteronomy and Leviticus in the books of Moses
36:22 -  of what would befall us in the last days if we will not acknowledge our transgression and that of our fathers
36:32 -  that the sword would pursue us and terror in the chamber and the infant and the old man at the bottom
36:46 -  and the young man and the maiden at the top exactly the way the bodies were stacked in the gas ovens God made the terror his judgment
37:06 -  but he will not avert it or he is not God and only the people who will tell Jacob their sins
37:24 -  and the judgment that is yet to come of which I spoke last night of which Jesus spoke
37:36 -  that there will never again be anything like it that eclipses all of the suffering of the past even the Nazi Holocaust itself
37:50 -  and if that time were not cut short no flesh would survive that time is future the conditions for it are already at work
38:02 -  it's near who will tell Israel their transgressions
38:12 -  and that you're going to suffer again for your unrecognized transgression that instead of coming out of the Holocaust
38:26 -  broken and repentant to ask why did we suffer this where was God
38:40 -  for his covenant people unless he was required to be silent or as the scripture says
38:52 -  to turn his face from us and that what we have suffered was in the exact proportion to our sins
39:09 -  and the sins of our fathers for which there has been no capora no covering, no remission
39:23 -  for without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin no levitical priesthood
39:35 -  no place of sacrifice no shedding of blood two thousand years of accumulated Jewish sin
39:51 -  without a covering open and naked to the retribution of the powers of darkness only too happy to inflict the judgment
40:09 -  and take a malicious delight in doing instead of crying out what was our sin
40:21 -  we cried out never again not us we may have been victim in the past
40:32 -  in our Jewish defenselessness but now in the possession of the state and the apparatus of the state
40:44 -  number one world's air force military power never again
40:55 -  and who contradicts us who warns us who shows us the word of God
41:07 -  of the judgments that have come and the judgments that will come only a church that really loves us
41:19 -  loves our souls and wants to save us from the eternal fire and will speak a warning
41:32 -  that will not be appreciated that will not be understood that will invite angry reprisal
41:42 -  how dare you speak this to us German Christians too
41:50 -  after what we have suffered at your hands we have been your victim and so long as we condescend to them
42:00 -  and walk on egg shells not to offend and to seek a reconciliation which never comes
42:14 -  nor can it come is only serving our emotional need
42:25 -  and offers nothing to the Jew redemptively it confirms them
42:35 -  in their understanding of themselves as victims after all for what sin should they have been judged
42:47 -  they live such a nice bourgeois life and made their contributions
42:55 -  to society and never hurt anybody only those who have the courage
43:05 -  to speak to them the truth can save them from the judgment that is to come
43:17 -  both in time and eternity so long as they see themselves as victim victim of what?
43:29 -  of the church's failure the bankruptcy of Christianity and the corruption of the New Testament
43:43 -  that encourages anti-Semitic attitudes so long as you condescend to them you confirm them
43:55 -  in their victim mentality and their condemnation of the church and the church's message
44:07 -  and the church's gospel and therefore it robs them of the only hope that could save them out of death and hell
44:20 -  brother what you're suggesting is frightening I don't have the courage for it I don't have the ability for it
44:32 -  that's true in your present condition but the resurrected Christ
44:41 -  but the resurrected Christ to whom all authority has been given in heaven and in earth
44:51 -  the high priest and the apostle of our confession the ultimate prophet who is also truth
45:03 -  as he is also love he would not withhold himself he would suffer the death of their disappointment
45:17 -  he would suffer the deception the pain of their rejection he did it 2000 years ago in his own body
45:29 -  and he will do it now in yours and you will be able to say with Paul for me to live
45:40 -  is Christ here is your sin you're falling short of the glory of God
45:50 -  and living beneath the resurrection applauding yourself
45:58 -  that you endorse the doctrine but have no necessity for its reality well able to conduct services
46:08 -  and programs as a church that has its own satisfaction as its purpose for being
46:20 -  but take the apostolic mandate of God seriously you'll have to say with Paul as I have to say
46:34 -  standing tonight in front of you speaking this for a first time who is sufficient for these things
46:46 -  a church that's sufficient is outside the faith is already apostate
46:56 -  and doesn't know it yes, there's a repentance which God is waiting for
47:03 -  but not the sentimental one that we thought that only provides us with a relief it's a deep repentance
47:15 -  historically overdone historically long-standing and the truth of the church still
47:29 -  even in its best charismatic forms only by his life could Paul's apostolic burden
47:41 -  for his brethren after the flesh be known only by his life
47:49 -  where was that? yeah, the Jesus life only by that life
47:55 -  could he have the courage to express it only by that life could he have the courage to express it and suffer the rejection that it must bring
48:12 -  only by the life the Christ life the resurrection life
48:18 -  that union that oneness would have shown the Jew in your midst
48:27 -  and that would have shown the Jew in your midst in the past between mere religion
48:35 -  between mere religion and authentic spirituality that demonstration
48:43 -  was never made for 2000 years so what alternative did they have? but their own rabbinical Judaism
49:00 -  or secular culture and in that they perished we're called to move Israel to jealousy
49:14 -  and Paul doesn't explain what that means as if this is a critical purpose for our life as the church
49:24 -  to move to jealousy the enemies of the gospel is ultimate requirement
49:34 -  is ultimate requirement and the church that can answer it and the church that can answer it
49:40 -  is indeed the church and will only become such a church and will only become such a church
49:48 -  out of repentance out of repentance and awareness of its terrible
49:54 -   and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible
49:58 -  and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible
50:04 -  and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible
50:08 -  and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible
50:13 -  and awareness of its terrible and awareness of its terrible and even admiration for your courage
50:26 -  to face them with an unwelcome message that you know they're going to reject and yet you're compelled by the love of Christ
50:43 -  You're not able to keep silence you are Christ-full and when they see this
50:49 -  that you're willing to risk their censure and their condemnation you're the painful rejection of a Germany that so desperately wants Jewish approval
51:11 -  that that very courage will move them to jealousy because they know it's beyond religion it's nothing other than God himself
51:30 -  I'm a Jewish believer burdened both for Germany and for Israel but I'm strangely chafed at this so-called repentance
51:45 -  needing continually to be repeated affecting nothing in the church and certainly nothing for the Jew
52:00 -  repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand this requires a valid baptism
52:11 -  one that is a real burial because our history and present life has persuaded us that in ourselves
52:24 -  there's no man good even our best intentions are not good enough only Christ
52:34 -  the resurrected one as our life consistently
52:40 -  is our answer and God has provided the means a baptism which is more than a religious ordinance
52:54 -  it's a burial of that which needs to be brought to death but there's no hope for it even in its best German form
53:07 -  who fall short of the glory of God who will enter those waters that's once and for all
53:20 -  and if there's no resurrection after that burial you of all men are most to be pitied but don't think that you're going back to your job
53:34 -  your business, your profession all of the nice amenities of your present life your hopes for the future
53:46 -  you have no hope you've died to hope this is a newness of life
53:54 -  and it's radical and it has one motivation only the glory of God
54:04 -  and not our convenience it's for the want of this that God is waiting repentance
54:16 -  we have practiced a Christianity of convenience and it left a great vacuum as it necessarily must
54:30 -  and into it came demonic Nazism we made it possible we provided the vacuum
54:44 -  into which this evil came as a flood for nature abhors a vacuum and will soon enough fill it
55:04 -  if not with the reality of God then the reality of Satan Nazism is our fault
55:16 -  respectable and polite Christianity not only made it possible but made it inevitable
55:26 -  the kind of Christianity that we thought would be polite and humane where God wanted to
55:36 -  garland the cross with roses wonderful human sentimentality becomes ironically
55:50 -  exactly it's opposite in the most ugly
55:58 -  bizarre inhumanity and cruelty we can think in man
56:12 -  be assured your sins will find you out and it will express itself ironically
56:24 -  you celebrated humanism and wanted to be polite and nice then here's the fulfillment
56:34 -  bestiality unbelievable cruelty utterly inhumane
56:44 -  God is not mocked and whatsoever a nation sows that too will it reap
56:54 -  that too will it reap there's no understanding of what is Jewish independent of what is German
57:10 -  we have affected each other shaped a common culture conspired against God
57:20 -  and against his king and we have both suffered for it what would it mean for a German
57:30 -  church now that does not just seek its own cathartic relief
57:44 -  but will find a place of true repentance and brokenness
57:54 -  not only for itself but for its fathers for do not think that you would have done
58:02 -  any better than they if you had lived in the Nazi time no man good, no nut one
58:14 -  we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and God is waiting for that repentance and the laying down of that life
58:24 -  and the evidence of the truth of it that we will find a new ability and a burning passion
58:34 -  to tell Jacob of their sins in Israel of their transgressions to tell Jacob of their sins in Israel
58:42 -  of their transgressions for that prophetic church that can warn of the judgment to come
58:56 -  is alone qualified to speak of the restoration that will follow comfort ye, comfort ye, my brethren
59:08 -  for they have suffered double for their sins they don't need some kind of schmaltzy sentimental pat on the back
59:24 -  they need comfort that is by the spirit God's own word
59:34 -  in the midst of their being judged by a people who did not withhold and did not spare
59:46 -  they spoke the word of judgment they called Israel to the recognition of its sin they will also speak to Israel
59:58 -  God's comfort that will be a comfort indeed the same comfort that you yourself will know
01:00:08 -  who have been raised out of death unto newness of life and can rejoice in Christ Jesus
01:00:20 -  as savior and deliverer you'll comfort them with the same comfort wherewith you have been comforted
01:00:30 -  if indeed you have been comforted and your religious life is not a fraud so this is the deep repentance that is needed
01:00:48 -  not the holocaust as some regrettable momentary lapse an embarrassing historical failure but the inevitable consequence
01:01:04 -  of our own long apostasy our sin is Israel's sin and it is exactly the same sin
01:01:22 -  and it is the same sin and it is exactly the same sin we will not charge them with their sins
01:01:30 -  from some place of superiority from the place of brokenness the priestly place
01:01:46 -  that is able to speak to a sinning people that is able to speak to a sinning people as those who know their own sins
01:01:58 -  and are exactly as Israel's a church willing to come under the Jewish people in its priestly service
01:02:12 -  in its priestly service for which they seek nothing for themselves no benefit, no satisfaction
01:02:26 -  no personal relief for their sake and the Lord's sake
01:02:38 -  a priestly church a repentant church what a blessing for Israel
01:02:48 -  a real blessing and what a blessing for the German nation itself to have such a presence in its midst
01:03:02 -  of a broken priestly people willing to come under another willing to come under another
01:03:12 -  and forfeit any self interest of its own I can't think of any single message that Germany needs more to hear
01:03:28 -  I can't think of any demonstration present Germany needs now more to see what is not only God's calling for the church of Germany
01:03:44 -  but the nation itself God's purpose is not your imperial ambition that you should be a master people over the nations
01:04:00 -  that you should be a master people over the nations he knows your secret heart and this ambition has never died
01:04:18 -  that when the historic reconciliation between East and West Germany came when the historic reconciliation
01:04:24 -  between East and West Germany came I personally did not rejoice something in the inner man
01:04:36 -  now we'll see it again now we will see it again the true Germany
01:04:44 -  in its ambition and power in its ambition and power betraying God's call
01:04:56 -  not to be a great force in the world but a priestly nation to the people Israel
01:05:12 -  so that they might be restored to Zion so that they might be restored to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord
01:05:22 -  for their redemption is his coming and his coming is his kingdom in which nations shall study war again
01:05:32 -  no more the Jew is not just another ethnic people the Jew is not just another ethnic people
01:05:44 -  they are at the heart of God's theocratic design for only with their return will his law go forth out of Zion
01:06:04 -  you could do nothing more for the nations you could do nothing more for the nations not that they should admire
01:06:14 -  your engineering brilliance and your masterful business ability but that you should affect
01:06:26 -  Israel's true restoration true restoration that they might bless all the families of the earth
01:06:38 -  that they might bless all the families of the earth and all the nations will know that the God of Jacob is a long God
01:06:52 -  that's your task go tell it at the Reichstag but with apostolic conviction
01:07:00 -  but with apostolic conviction not as a theory an opinion, a suggestion
01:07:10 -  but as the word of the Lord to the nation spoken with authority
01:07:20 -  by a people whom he has raised from the dead because they have deeply repented for their own sins
01:07:32 -  and the sins of the fathers of which the Holocaust was only a symptom the Holocaust is to Germany
01:07:44 -  what the crucifixion of Jesus is to Israel our Jewish sin is not the crucifixion of Jesus
01:07:54 -  our Jewish sin is not the crucifixion of Jesus it's the summation of all our sins our long history of apostasy
01:08:06 -  our long history of apostasy and the rejection of the prophets that were sent unto us that when the Lord himself came
01:08:18 -  we could not only not recognize him but we were offended by him and had to crucify him
01:08:26 -  he was the summation of our sin and not the sin in itself so also the Holocaust for Germany
01:08:36 -  it's not the sin in itself it's the summation of all your sins through all your generations
01:08:46 -  in converting the radical faith into a domestic addendum a Sunday convenience
01:09:02 -  to the burglish life repent for your fathers and for yourselves
01:09:12 -  for nothing has changed and God will not honor your false repentance that seeks only your relief
01:09:26 -  he waits for this recognition this depth this depth
01:09:36 -  that he might be all in all Israel's destiny is at stake our eternal destiny
01:09:48 -  waits more on such a church in Germany than in any other nation the nation that cast us into the physical fires
01:10:04 -  is the same intended by God to save us from the eternal fire of his judgment
01:10:14 -  you have a destiny a mandate unfulfilled
01:10:22 -  that you cannot fulfill in yourself but only in the power of his life but only in the power of his life
01:10:32 -  but only in the power of his life in union with him both in death
01:10:44 -  burial and resurrection I want to pray
01:10:50 -  for such a repentance such a church such a nation
01:10:58 -  such a people Lord, if this is your word it astonishes me
01:11:10 -  but let the spirit of truth witness to it stab us in our hearts even where our minds cannot lay hold of all this
01:11:24 -  it's so different from what we have understood thinking we were doing Israel's service to let them alone
01:11:36 -  to be polite come oh Lord in this first speaking of this word in this nation
01:11:48 -  let there be from among this people the first fruits of repentance the first breaking
01:11:58 -  the first willing going down into death the forsaking of all interest
01:12:10 -  and if there is no resurrection this people of all people are most to be pitied
01:12:20 -  and our Jewish people with them so in the name of Jesus as the minister of this word
01:12:32 -  I invite you to repentance authentic repentance for yourself and for your fathers
01:12:42 -  unto death a real going down a real going down
01:12:50 -  in which when you are raised up your life will no longer be your own his
01:13:00 -  Christ fools for his last days purpose and his purpose of life
01:13:12 -  and his purpose alone now don't mock God don't come out of your seat
01:13:28 -  for psychological relief as a religious reflex action come out of your seat for death
01:13:42 -  with the end of all your expectations even of how you were going to serve God it's no longer your problem
01:13:58 -  it is his when he will have the total possession when he will have the total possession
01:14:06 -  for the expression of his life who will come forward for this who will kneel at this platform for this
01:14:20 -  you will validate your baptism and bring to it the meaning
01:14:28 -  that God had always intended God waits for this repentance
01:14:40 -  who will come go down go down
01:14:52 -  this is the end and a new beginning hope for Germany
01:15:02 -  hope for Israel that is hope indeed the triumphant life of Christ
01:15:12 -  that death could not contain which Jews had never seen in your midst we'll see now
01:15:26 -  thank you Lord thank you Lord precious God look upon us
01:15:36 -  this is not a sentimental gesture this is not a religious response this is significant response
01:15:52 -  for those who have heard your word and have received your call seal it in heaven
01:16:02 -  put an end to the natural life to the religious life to the charismatic life
01:16:10 -  to the well-meaning life to the polite life and be radical
01:16:18 -  be raised up in this people that they might lift their voice as a trumpet to tell Israel its sins
01:16:30 -  Jacob their transgressions and Germany its error its false ambition
01:16:44 -  its continuing imperialist desire for God has appointed a day in which he will judge all nations
01:16:56 -  by that man whom he has raised from the dead let your voice be heard in this earth whether you were sprinkled with water
01:17:10 -  or were baptized whether you were sprinkled with water or were baptized and immersed
01:17:24 -  God is not interested in the form he is interested in the reality made possible by his own death and resurrection
01:17:38 -  he gives you this opportunity to join him in the waters of death that you might be raised to newness of life
01:17:50 -  more than politeness rehearse this with him you who are down on your knees
01:18:02 -  Lord I receive my baptism though I didn't understand it then
01:18:12 -  I understand it now and I receive it as my death I am buried with you
01:18:24 -  and when I get up from my knees I fully expect to experience the resurrection
01:18:34 -  the newness of life new thought, new expression new impulse
01:18:40 -  new courage new love that's really love beyond sentiment
01:18:48 -  that can be offended against and not fail for it is your love
01:18:56 -  your unconditional love that Israel needs to experience by those who will convey it
01:19:04 -  for they are in your life Lord I seal these children unto the resurrection
01:19:14 -  and raise up in this church an intention beyond anything that men have conceived
01:19:24 -  maybe for the first in the history of the church in Germany an apostolic church
01:19:34 -  whose foundations are immovable for whom the kingdom has come beyond the petty religious ambitions of men
01:19:48 -  because they have repented unto the resurrection because they have repented
01:19:58 -  unto death even of their own design for the church that your kingdom might come
01:20:08 -  seal it perform it be glorified by it
01:20:16 -  let this night be historic for the church of Jesus Christ in this nation
01:20:26 -  that Israel might be blessed and your soul gratified and your name glorified
01:20:40 -  before all nations thy kingdom come is our cry
01:20:48 -  and our belief our real hope in Jesus name we pray
01:20:56 -  amen
