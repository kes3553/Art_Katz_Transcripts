True Repentance for the German

00:00 -  for the kingdom of God is at hand. These words, spoken first by the Baptist John and Jesus, are inexorably joined, always.
00:28 -  You cannot speak of the kingdom without speaking of repentance. There's no entry into the kingdom without repentance. So we have the reality of the kingdom in exact proportion as we have authentic repentance.
00:51 -  And it's not a once and for all repentance. It's a continual state of being. More rightly, a state of death.
01:07 -  For true repentance is the awesome acknowledgement of God. As he in fact is, and not as we thought him to be. And before that holy presence, no man dare lift his head.
01:32 -  Job was described by God himself as being outstanding, the foremost of all men. God boasted on him, and yet at the end of God's dealings with him, the same man cries out,
01:55 -  I've heard of you with the hearing of my ear, but now my eye sees, and I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
02:13 -  This is classic. This is definitive. And we fall grievously short of this repentance.
02:27 -  And for that reason the kingdom does not come. It's the ultimate expression of God in glory. And requires the most profound coming down of man before it.
02:49 -  What does it mean to repent in dust and ashes? What does that symbolically represent? Having gone under the ground in burial.
03:02 -  There's no place for me other than to be buried. Now that I have glimpsed you as you are, there's no place for me as man but in death.
03:20 -  And God received that statement from Job. And he said pray for your friends, and he said pray for your friends, your comforters,
03:36 -  for my anger is kindled against them, for you have not spoken as my servant Job has spoken. I'm continually leaving bewildered saints in my path.
03:59 -  And I'm remembering one occasion in America, an outstandingly successful fellowship. You know what my message for them was?
04:12 -  You think you have it all together? You haven't even begun to speak as Job's comforters have spoken. Which is the most sublime spirituality in the Holy Scripture.
04:29 -  It was not appropriate for Job, but the statements in themselves are sublimely spiritual. And despite that God says my anger is kindled against you.
04:45 -  And despite that God says my anger is kindled against you. However spiritually insightful you were, deep in your understanding,
05:00 -  you still failed. For there's only one statement that I can receive from man. I abhor myself
05:13 -  and repent in dust and ashes. Is there a nation in the world today for which the issue of repentance is more important than Germany?
05:33 -  You will live continually under the shadow of the historic past. Will you ever be washed from the stain of the Holocaust? And yet there's continual reference to repentance.
05:59 -  And I've had opportunity to observe it. Even most recently in the conference on prayer for Israel in Berlin. There's a continual theme of repentance toward the Jew and toward Israel
06:17 -  on the part of the German church. You would think that as a Jewish believer my spirit would rejoice. But the more that I heard these appeals to repentance,
06:43 -  and witnessed the character of it, the more uncomfortable I felt in the inner man. Something is wrong with this kind of repentance.
07:02 -  One of the evidences of which is the continual need to reiterate it. How often are we going to feel sorry for the same thing? That it needs again and again to be restated.
07:21 -  Maybe the problem is that we have not rightly understood repentance. Maybe the problem is that we have not rightly understood repentance. And that feeling sorry falls short of it.
07:41 -  I got the impression that what these German saints wanted was psychological relief. They came to the conference in the hope of it. And needed so desperately to experience it.
08:06 -  There's a word for this in psychology. They wanted catharsis. A relief.
08:16 -  A relief for a burden of guilt. That evidently had not been met in any other way. And so I began to ponder this before the Lord.
08:34 -  And here is my essay. Notes on the issue of German repentance toward Israel. What's wrong with this kind of repentance?
08:50 -  Maybe it has to do with not rightly understanding the issue of guilt. That assumes that Germany is the cause of the Holocaust against the Jew. That assumes that Germany is the cause of the Holocaust against the Jew.
09:17 -  If that's your understanding, you'll never be relieved. Because it misses the truth of the Holocaust itself.
09:32 -  The magnitude of that tragedy is beyond the issue of German repentance. The magnitude of that tragedy is beyond the issue of German repentance. And if we were students of God's dealings in history with Israel,
09:54 -  we would be able to distinguish between the judgments that God brings and the rod that he employs. Nazi Germany was the rod of God's chastisement. Nazi Germany was the rod of God's chastisement.
10:15 -  But the cause was Jewish sin itself. But the cause was Jewish sin itself. Historic and present.
10:31 -  The sins of the fathers never recognized or acknowledged
10:40 -  the cries of the prophets never heard nor repented for.
10:49 -  And the sin continues and gathers its weight. And though God may deter in bringing his judgment,
10:57 -  And though God may deter in bringing his judgment, he's not under obligation to bring it immediately in a cause and effect situation.
11:11 -  But bring it he will. In his own time, for his own purpose.
11:22 -  So you need to pray for the book that Klaus is translating. So you need to pray for the book that Klaus is translating. Utterly radical in its thesis.
11:38 -  Jews will rail against it. Segments of the church will be offended by it. The Holocaust as judgment.
11:58 -  In exact proportion to Jewish sin. Yes, even in Germany. The kind of influence that we expressed in our history here.
12:21 -  Our substitution of German civilization for God's messianic answer. Our substitution of German civilization
12:30 -  for God's messianic answer. Encouraging German rationalism. Encouraging German rationalism.
12:39 -  That is offended by the supernatural God. That is offended by the supernatural God. That had its final expression in God is dead theology.
12:48 -  That had its final expression in God is dead theology. And in the Jewish reform And in the Jewish reform
12:57 -  Judaism. This is more than I can say at the moment. This is more than I can say at the moment.
13:08 -  God's judgments are always in proportion to our sins. God's judgments are always in proportion to our sins. And when Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem,
13:21 -  And when Eichmann was tried in Jerusalem, The condemning, what do you call it? The prosecuting attorney.
13:35 -  Gideon Hausner writes this in his memoirs. A man's sin or his crimes
13:44 -  or that of a nation may go for a long time unrecognized and unattended may go for a long time unrecognized and unattended
13:57 -  but there must come a time but there must come a time when the culprit is apprehended
14:06 -  and the righteous judgment inflicted. And the righteous judgment inflicted. So had it come for Eichmann.
14:15 -  Many years after the end of the Nazi time Many years after the end of the Nazi time as the scripture says, be assured your sins will find you out.
14:24 -  As the scripture says, be assured your sins will find you out. It found us out in the Holocaust. It found us out in the Holocaust.
14:34 -  And why was Germany the rod of our chastisement? And why was Germany the rod of our chastisement? And why was Germany the rod of our chastisement?
14:43 -  Because we so celebrated German culture. Because we so celebrated German culture. There was no segment of the German population
14:52 -  more enthusiastic for Goethe, Schiller, Fichte and Hegel. There was no segment of the German population more enthusiastic for Goethe, Schiller, Fichte and Hegel.
15:05 -  And we could not believe that a Hitler could come to power. And we could not believe that a Hitler could come to power. Not in the land of such celebrated civilization and culture.
15:14 -  Not in the land of such celebrated civilization and culture. This has got to be a momentary thing. This has got to be a momentary thing.
15:22 -  This too shall pass. But it did not pass. And became our judgment.
15:32 -  So to feel guilty as the cause of the Holocaust So to feel guilty as the cause of the Holocaust is a false guilt.
15:42 -  Is a false guilt. One that God would not have you to assume. One that God would not have you to assume.
15:50 -  Does that mean that Germany is completely absolved of all responsibility? Does that mean that Germany is completely absolved of all responsibility? Not at all.
16:00 -  You are still the rod of God's chastisement. You are still the rod of God's chastisement. And the willing rod.
16:09 -  And for that there needs to be acknowledgement and repentance. And for that there needs to be acknowledgement and repentance. But not for a falsely assumed guilt.
16:18 -  But not for a falsely assumed guilt. There is a deeper sin than the Holocaust. There is a deeper sin than the Holocaust.
16:32 -  For which repentance, God still waits. For which repentance, God still waits. And there he will not, therefore he will not honour your false repentance.
16:42 -  For which repentance, God still waits. Which you're only wanting for your psychological relief. The German sin is identically the same as the Jewish sin.
17:05 -  For which the Holocaust is the judgement. What is that sin? It is the betrayal of the true faith.
17:18 -  By both Christians and Jews. In taking our inheritance. And domesticating it.
17:33 -  And making of it a Sunday or a Saturday culture. And making of it a Saturday or a Sunday culture. A bourgeois accommodation.
17:46 -  That would not in any way threaten our real interests. And allow us a modicum of religiosity. And allow us a modicum of religiosity.
18:04 -  That's the sin. For which repentance, God waits. The taking of the apostolic faith.
18:16 -  And the making of it some kind of addendum to our busy life. Not just in our liberal Christianity, but in our orthodox. It's nothing less than the misuse of God.
18:39 -  For man's own purposes and man's own ends. It is ultimate ideology. Because it is performed in the name of God.
18:57 -  And thinks it is even doing him service. And so to seek psychological relief through repentance. Is to continue in that same sin.
19:21 -  We are the object of our religious life. Our relief, our satisfaction, our happiness. It's the way it has always been.
19:37 -  And its character yet remains. Even in its best charismatic forms. We have not seen this.
19:48 -  And repented. For the misuse of God. In the framing of a religious life.
19:59 -  In which our personal and selfish interests are foremost. That has no interest in a kingdom come. It certainly doesn't want to experience the inconvenience.
20:18 -  Let alone be an object of opposition or persecution. Better to supply a religious accommodation. And sanctify the purposes of the state.
20:42 -  And give its imperialist ambitions a little religious aura. This is not only Germany's sin, it's the sin of Christian nations everywhere. And the decline of Great Britain is the evidence.
21:03 -  The land of Spurgeon and George Whitfield. The great missionaries. The great missionaries.
21:18 -  Is the land of the rock punk culture. And its celebrated Christianity. Has a funeral for Princess Diana.
21:38 -  Who is a jet set princess of the worst kind. Who is a jet set princess of the worst kind. Such is the bankruptcy of British Christianity.
21:55 -  I waited for the British church to express its prophetic voice. To protest the celebration of this pagan. And her illicit relationship with a Muslim prince.
22:19 -  Not a word. Not a statement. Even in its prophetic publications.
22:33 -  There's a repentance for which God is waiting. But it's not for our relief. It's for his.
22:44 -  For we have offended against him since time memorial. And what rubs the salt into the wound. Is not to offend against him as pagans.
22:59 -  But as Jews and as Christians. Who share together the same mentality. Of a religious convenience.
23:11 -  That serves the purposes of man. And is entirely indifferent to the purposes of God. Ultimate idolatry.
23:27 -  Performed in the name of God himself. And still continuing. In seeking this cathartic relief.
23:36 -  At Israel's expense. And the fact that this relief is never obtained. Needs again and again to be repeated.
23:50 -  Shows how questionable are its motives. And how unrecognized. The church wants to repent about Israel?
24:06 -  I'll give you a good reason. Your failure to have made known to the Israel in your midst. The reality of its own Messiah and God.
24:28 -  In whom you professed to believe. Allowing them to coexist side by side. To have their own religious institutions.
24:43 -  As if somehow the synagogue is a valid religious reality. And not a statement of continuing Jewish faith. And not a Jewish apostasy from Christ.
25:08 -  Is there any nation in the world. That has had a longer Jewish presence than Germany. And has so little affected them by your witness.
25:31 -  We had a direct mandate in scripture. This gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. To the Jew first.
25:48 -  And then also to the Greek. God's priority, God's order. Which we consciously circumvented.
26:00 -  Because the Jews are so intimidating. And so bright. And intellectual.
26:10 -  And professional. And their lives seem so well ordered. Better than ours.
26:20 -  How dare we tell them that they are lost without our Christ. How dare we tell them that they are lost without our Christ. In whose name Jews have suffered historically in Germany.
26:36 -  Such an obedience to the requirement of Jesus as Lord. Has got to appear to Jews as being utmost arrogance. Who would dare perform it?
26:58 -  Only one. That one who is truly repentant and broken. And has so descended into death.
27:12 -  Which is what repentance is. A burial of the inadequate religious life. And a coming forth in a newness of life.
27:28 -  That does not need Jewish approval. And is willing to bear the offense. Of the gospel itself.
27:46 -  In that you have failed. In that you have failed. You have not maintained an apostolic witness.
27:56 -  To that people whom God has placed in your midst. It's the statement of your failure. The betrayal of the kingdom.
28:10 -  And it's gone on historically. And never been recognized. As a sin.
28:20 -  And therefore continues still. The scandal of the Jew is something that polite Christianity cannot afford. And if German society has been anything, it's been polite.
28:42 -  More important to be polite than to be radical. No wonder Nietzsche said, God is dead. He showed no evidence.
28:56 -  He showed no evidence. He showed no evidence. In polite German Christianity.
29:08 -  For a Christianity that is polite is not Christian. It's a contradiction in terms. The very nature of the faith is radical.
29:22 -  It will always bring upon itself reproach. It's a reproach for which German Christians were unwilling. Of course Paul said he would wish himself accursed for his brethren's sake.
29:46 -  That they might know Christ. Of course that's Paul. That's not us.
29:56 -  That's a man speaking as a Jew. In his fleshly ethnic identifications, with his own people.
30:08 -  Of course we could not be expected to have a burden like that. Really? Well I want to raise a question.
30:20 -  Is Paul crying out in Romans 9 out of his Jewishness? What he is in the natural? Or is he crying out as an apostle?
30:38 -  And that the grief he's expressing is not some ethnic identification, but that of the high priest and the apostle of the faith himself. If that's true,
30:58 -  then there's a possibility for an identification with the Jewish people. That is beyond sentiment. It is the deep heart cry of God himself.
31:14 -  For which we would be willing to forfeit our own salvation. Did Paul have it because he was a Jew? Did Paul have it because he was a Jew?
31:28 -  Did Paul have it because he was a Jew? Or because he was an apostle? I'm not talking about his title.
31:42 -  I'm talking about his apostolic union with God. His repentance was authentic. It was not a little feeling sorry.
31:58 -  It was a man who went down into death. And everything that he celebrated as a man and religiously died with him. All his categories went into death.
32:16 -  And he was raised to newness of life. There's no one in whom the resurrected Christ had greater continuation than the apostle Paul. There's no one in whom the resurrected Christ had greater continuation than the apostle Paul.
32:34 -  That's what he meant when he said for me to live as Christ. What's our excuse? What did Paul enjoy that is not available to us?
32:50 -  What expression of the resurrection life What expression of the resurrection life which bears the grief of God for Israel
33:02 -  and the courage to express it is not available to us also. Everything depends on our repentance
33:16 -  expressed in our baptism. Was it a burial? The only thing that our humanity deserves?
33:26 -  For in the flesh is no good thing at all? Or was it a getting wet? Performing a religious obligation?
33:38 -  By those who did not recognize that baptism is a burial? By those who did not recognize that baptism is a burial? By those who did not recognize that baptism is a burial?
33:52 -  And if they knew it even now would not desire it. How shall we expect apostolic reality from a church
34:10 -  that is still alive unto itself and has never repented unto death? And wants only relief?
34:22 -  And is itself the object of its own consideration? And is itself the object of its own consideration? I'm not arguing now for a form of baptism
34:36 -  I'm not arguing now for a form of baptism because my preference of course is for the full immersion as burial because my preference of course is for the full immersion as burial
34:48 -  but there are untold millions who have gone down that way but there are untold millions who have gone down that way and came up out of that water
35:00 -  no more changed than those who were merely sprinkled. What was their intention? Certainly not death.
35:14 -  Not burial. Because they were not at all convinced that something so radical would be demanded of them. After all, they were nice people
35:28 -  who needed only to be reformed or improved but not buried.
35:42 -  The Jew finds us out and has always revealed the condition of the church even Luther's condition
35:54 -  there's something about the unbelieving Jew that reveals our secret heart and shows us where in fact we are
36:08 -  not only with regard to them but with regard to God a really repentant German Christian
36:28 -  will tell Israel their sins and Jacob their transgressions that's what we are told in Isaiah
36:44 -  do not hold back lift your voice like a trumpet tell Israel of its sin
36:56 -  and Jacob of his transgressions and that the Holocaust was not some momentary historic aberration
37:08 -  but the calculated judgment of God promised in Scripture in Deuteronomy and Leviticus in the books of Moses
37:22 -  of what would befall us in the last days if we will not acknowledge our transgression and that of our fathers
37:34 -  that the sword would pursue us and terror in the chamber and the infant and the old man at the bottom
37:44 -  and the young man and the maiden at the top exactly the way the bodies were stacked in the gas ovens the bodies were stacked in the gas ovens
38:06 -  God may deter His judgment but He will not avert it or He is not God
38:18 -  and only the people who will tell Jacob their sins and the judgment that is yet to come of which I spoke last night
38:34 -  of which Jesus spoke that there will never again be anything like it that eclipses all of the suffering of the past
38:44 -  that eclipses all of the suffering of the past even the Nazi Holocaust itself and if that time were not cut short
38:54 -  no flesh would survive that time is future the conditions for it are already at work
39:06 -  it's near who will tell Israel their transgressions
39:16 -  and that you're going to suffer again for your unrecognized transgression for your unrecognized transgression
39:28 -  that instead of coming out of the Holocaust broken and repentant to ask why did we suffer this
39:38 -  to ask why did we suffer this where is God for His covenant people
39:46 -  for His covenant people unless He was required to be silent or as the scripture says
39:56 -  to turn His face from us and that what we have suffered is an exact proportion to our sins
40:08 -  and the sins of our fathers and the sins of our forefathers for which there has been no capora
40:18 -  no covering, no remission for without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sin
40:32 -  no levitical priesthood no place of sacrifice no shedding of blood
40:42 -  two thousand years of accumulated Jewish sin without a covering
40:56 -  open and naked to the retribution of the powers of darkness only too happy to inflict the judgment
41:12 -  and take a malicious delight in doing instead of crying out what was our sin
41:24 -  we cried out never again not us maybe we have been victim in the past
41:36 -  in our Jewish defenselessness but now in the possession of the state and the apparatus of the state
41:48 -  number one world's air force, military power never again and who contradicts us
42:02 -  who warns us who shows us the word of God of the judgments that have come
42:14 -  and the judgments that will come only a church that really loves us loves our souls
42:24 -  loves our souls and wants to save us from the eternal fire and will speak a warning
42:36 -  that will not be appreciated that will not be understood that will invite angry reprisal
42:46 -  how dare you speak this to us German Christians after all we have suffered through your hands
42:56 -  we have been your victim and so long as we condescend to them and walk on eggshells
43:08 -  not to offend and to seek a reconciliation which never comes nor can it come
43:20 -  is only serving our emotional need and offers nothing to the Jew redemptively it confirms them in their understanding of themselves as victims
43:42 -  after all what sin should they have been judged they live such a nice bourgeois life and made their contributions to society
43:56 -  and never hurt anybody only those who have the courage to speak to them the truth
44:04 -  can save them from the judgment that is to come both in time and eternity so long as they see themselves as victim
44:20 -  victim of what? of the church of the church
44:30 -  of the church of the church's failure the bankruptcy of Christianity
44:42 -  and the corruption of the New Testament that encourages anti-Semitic attitudes so long as you condescend to them
44:58 -  you confirm them in their victim mentality and in their condemnation of the church and the church's message
45:14 -  and the church's gospel and therefore it robs them of the only hope that could save them out of death and hell
45:26 -  brother what you are suggesting is frightening I don't have the courage for it I don't have the ability for it
45:36 -  that's true in your present condition but the resurrected Christ
45:48 -  to whom all authority has been given in heaven and in earth the high priest and the apostle of our confession the ultimate prophet
46:04 -  who is also truth as he is also love he would not withhold himself
46:16 -  he would suffer the death of their disappointment he would suffer the pain of their rejection
46:28 -  he had it two thousand years ago in his own body and he will do it now in yours you will be able to say with Paul
46:42 -  for me to live is Christ here is your sin you are falling short of the glory of God
46:54 -  and living beneath the resurrection applauding yourself that you endorse the doctrine
47:06 -  but have no necessity for its reality well able to conduct services and programs
47:18 -  as a church that has its own satisfaction as its purpose for being but take the apostolic mandate of God seriously
47:30 -  you'll have to say with Paul as I have to say standing tonight in front of you
47:42 -  speaking this for the first time who is sufficient for these things a church that's sufficient
47:52 -  is outside the faith it's already apostate and doesn't know it
48:02 -  yes there is a repentance for which God is waiting but not the sentimental one that we thought that only provides us with a relief
48:14 -  it's a deep repentance it's historically overdone long standing
48:26 -  and the truth of the church still even in its best charismatic forms only by his life
48:50 -  could Paul's apostolic burden for his brethren after the flesh be known only by his life
49:02 -  the Jesus life only by that life could he have the courage to express it
49:10 -  and suffer the rejection that it must bring only by the life the Christ life
49:20 -  the resurrection life that union, that oneness would have shown the Jew in your midst
49:30 -  the difference and that would have shown the Jew in your midst between mere religion
49:42 -  and authentic spirituality that demonstration was never made for 2000 years so what alternative did they have
50:00 -  but their own rabbinical Judaism or secular culture and in that they perished
50:12 -  we're called to move Israel to jealousy and Paul doesn't explain what that means as if this is a critical purpose for our life as the church
50:26 -  as if this is a critical purpose for our life as the church as if this is a critical purpose for our life as the church to move to jealousy the enemies of the gospel
50:42 -  is ultimate requirement and the church that can answer it is indeed the church
50:54 -  and will only become such a church out of repentance an awareness of its terrible
51:04 -  historic failure and its present failure still and repentance unto death
51:20 -  the woe is me, I'm undone out of that death will come the life that will move Jews to jealousy
51:32 -  even an admiration for your courage to face them with an unwelcome message that you know they're going to reject
51:48 -  and yet you're compelled by the love of Christ you cannot keep silence you're Christ's fool
51:56 -  and when they see this that you're willing to risk their censure and their condemnation the painful rejection
52:10 -  of a Germany that so desperately wants Jewish approval that that very courage
52:22 -  will move them to jealousy because they know it's beyond religion it's nothing other than God himself
52:40 -  I'm a Jewish believer burdened both for Germany and for Israel but I'm strangely chafed
52:50 -  at this so-called repentance needing continually to be repeated affecting nothing in the church
53:06 -  and certainly nothing for the Jews repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
53:16 -  this requires a valid baptism one that is a real burial because our history and present life has persuaded us
53:28 -  that in ourselves there's no man good even our best intentions are not good enough
53:40 -  only Christ the resurrected one as our life
53:46 -  consistently is our answer and God has provided the means
53:56 -  a baptism which is more than a religious ordinance it's a burial of that which needs to be brought to death for there's no hope for it
54:12 -  even in its best German form who fall short of the glory of God who will enter those waters
54:26 -  that's once and for all and if there's no resurrection after that burial you of all men are most to be pitied
54:40 -  but don't think that you're going back to your job your business, your profession all of the nice amenities of your present life
54:52 -  your hopes for the future you have no hope you've died to hope
55:00 -  this is a newness of life and it's radical and it has one motivation only
55:12 -  the glory of God and not our convenience it's for the want of this that God is waiting repentance
55:22 -  and if that doesn't exist, that's why God is still waiting for a curse we have practiced a Christianity of convenience and it left a great vacuum
55:36 -  as it necessarily must and into it came demonic Nazism we made it possible
55:48 -  we provided the vacuum into which this evil came as a flood for nature abhors a vacuum
56:04 -  and will soon enough fill it if not with the reality of God then the reality of Satan
56:18 -  then with the reality of Satan Nazism is our fault respectable and polite Christianity
56:28 -  not only made it possible but made it inevitable the kind of Christianity that we thought would be polite
56:40 -  and humane where Goethe wanted to garland the cross with roses where Goethe wanted to garland the cross with roses
56:54 -  a wonderful human sentimentality becomes ironically exactly its opposite in the most ugly
57:08 -  bizarre inhumanity and cruelty that beyond we can think in man
57:18 -  the most hideous kind of humanity that we saw be assured your sins will find you out
57:28 -  and it will express itself ironically you celebrated humanism and wanted to be polite and nice
57:40 -  then here's the fulfillment bestiality unbelievable cruelty
57:52 -  utterly inhumane God is not mocked and whatsoever a nation sows
58:04 -  that too will it reap there's no understanding of what is Jewish independent of what is German
58:18 -  we have affected each other shaped a common culture conspired against God
58:32 -  and against his king and we have both suffered for it what would it mean for a German church now
58:46 -  what would it mean for a German church now that does not just seek its own cathodic relief but will find a place of true repentance
59:04 -  but will find a place of true repentance and brokenness not only for itself but for its fathers
59:16 -  for do not think that you would have done any better than they if you had lived in the Nazi time no man good no not one
59:30 -  we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and God is waiting for that repentance and the laying down of that life
59:42 -  and the evidence of the truth of it that we will find a new ability and a burning passion
59:56 -  to tell Jacob of their sins and Israel of their transgressions to tell Jacob of their sins and Israel of their transgressions for that prophetic church that can warn of the judgment to come
01:00:12 -  is alone qualified to speak of the restoration that will follow is alone qualified to speak of the restoration that will follow for they have suffered double for their sins
01:00:26 -  for they have suffered double for their sins they don't need some kind of schmaltzy sentimental pat on the back they don't need some kind of schmaltzy sentimental pat on the back
01:00:40 -  they need comfort that is by the spirit God's own word that is by the spirit God's own word
01:00:50 -  in the midst of their being judged by a people who did not withhold and did not spare they spoke the word of judgment
01:01:06 -  they called Israel to the recognition of its sin they will also speak to Israel God's comfort they will also speak to Israel God's comfort
01:01:20 -  that will be a comfort indeed the same comfort that you yourself will know who have been raised out of death
01:01:32 -  unto newness of life and can rejoice in Christ Jesus as savior and deliverer
01:01:42 -  with them with the same comfort with which you have been comforted if indeed you have been comforted
01:01:54 -  and your religious life is not a fraud so this is the deep repentance that is needed not the holocaust as some regrettable momentary lapse
01:02:22 -  an embarrassing historical failure but the inevitable consequence of our own long apostasy
01:02:38 -  our sin is Israel's sin and it is exactly the same sin we will not charge them with their sins
01:02:50 -  from some place of superiority from the place of brokenness the priestly place
01:03:06 -  that is able to speak to a sinning people as those who know their own sins and are exactly as Israel's
01:03:22 -  a church willing to come under the Jewish people in its priestly service for which they seek nothing for themselves
01:03:36 -  no benefit, no satisfaction no personal relief for their sake
01:03:48 -  and the Lord's sake a priestly church a broken church
01:04:00 -  a repentant church what a blessing for Israel a real blessing
01:04:10 -  and what a blessing for the German nation itself to have such a presence in its midst of a broken priestly people
01:04:24 -  willing to come under another willing to come under another and forfeit any self interest of its own
01:04:36 -  I can't think of any single message that Germany needs more to hear I can't think of any demonstration
01:04:50 -  present Germany needs now more to see what is not only God's calling for the church of Germany but the nation itself
01:05:08 -  God's purpose is not your imperial ambition that you should be a master people over the nations
01:05:26 -  recognize your secret heart and this ambition has never died that when the historic reconciliation between East and West Germany came
01:05:46 -  I personally did not rejoice something in the inner man now we will see it again
01:06:00 -  the true Germany in its ambition and power betraying God's call
01:06:14 -  not to be a great force in the world but a priestly nation to the people of Israel
01:06:30 -  so that they might be restored to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord for their redemption is his coming
01:06:44 -  and his coming is his kingdom in which nations shall study war again no more the Jew is not just another ethnic people
01:07:02 -  they are at the heart of God's theocratic design for only with their return will his law go forth out of Zion
01:07:20 -  you could do nothing more for the nations not that they should admire your engineering brilliance
01:07:34 -  and your masterful business ability but that you should affect Israel's true restoration
01:07:44 -  true restoration that they might bless all the families of the earth and all the nations will know
01:08:00 -  that the God of Jacob is a long God that's your task go tell it at the right time
01:08:10 -  but with apostolic conviction not as a theory an opinion, a suggestion
01:08:24 -  but as the word of the Lord to the nation spoken with authority
01:08:34 -  by a people whom he has raised from the dead because they have deeply repented
01:08:44 -  of their own sins and the sins of the fathers of which the Holocaust was only a symptom the Holocaust is to Germany
01:08:58 -  what the crucifixion of Jesus is to Israel our Jewish sin is not the crucifixion of Jesus it's the summation of all our sins
01:09:12 -  our long history of apostasy and the rejection of the prophets that have come before us
01:09:22 -  and the rejection of the prophets that have come before us and the rejection of the prophets
01:09:28 -  that were sent unto us that when the Lord himself came we could not only not recognize him
01:09:40 -  but were offended by him and had to crucify him he was the summation of our sins
01:09:48 -  and not the sin in itself so also the Holocaust for Germany not the sin in itself
01:10:00 -  it's the summation of all your sins through all your generations in converting the radical faith
01:10:10 -  into a domestic addendum a Sunday convenience to the burglish life
01:10:26 -  repent for your fathers and for yourselves for nothing has changed
01:10:36 -  and God will not honor your false repentance that seeks only your relief he waits for this recognition
01:10:50 -  this depth this death that he might be all in all
01:11:00 -  Israel's destiny is at stake our eternal destiny waits more on such a church in Germany
01:11:14 -  than in any other nation the nation that cast us into the physical fires is the same intended by God
01:11:28 -  to save us from the eternal fire of his judgment
01:11:40 -  you have a destiny a mandate unfulfilled
01:11:48 -  that you cannot fulfill in yourself but only in the power of his life in union with him
01:12:00 -  both in death burial and resurrection
01:12:08 -  I want to pray for such a repentance such a church
01:12:14 -  such a nation for such a people Lord, if this is your word
01:12:24 -  it astonishes me but let the spirit of truth witness to it stab us in our hearts
01:12:38 -  even where our minds cannot lay hold of all this it's so different from what we have understood before
01:12:48 -  thinking we were doing Israel service to let them alone to be polite
01:13:00 -  come oh Lord in this first speaking of this word in this nation let there be from among this people
01:13:12 -  the first fruits of repentance the first breaking the first willing going down into death
01:13:24 -  the forsaking of all interest and if there is no resurrection
01:13:36 -  this people of all people are most to be pitied and our Jewish people with them
01:13:48 -  so in the name of Jesus as the minister of this word I invite you to repentance
01:13:58 -  authentic repentance for yourself and for your fathers unto death
01:14:06 -  a real going down a real going down which when you are raised up
01:14:16 -  your life will no longer be your own his Christ fools
01:14:28 -  for his last days purpose and his purpose alone don't mock God
01:14:42 -  don't come out of your seat for psychological relief as a religious
01:14:54 -  reflex action come out of your seat for death with the end of all your expectations
01:15:08 -  even of how you were going to serve God it's no longer your problem it is his
01:15:20 -  when he will have the total possession for the expression of his life who will come forward for this
01:15:32 -  who will kneel at this platform for this you will validate your baptism and bring to it the meaning
01:15:42 -  that God had always intended God waits for this repentance
01:15:54 -  who will come for this repentance who will come
01:16:10 -  go down go down this is the end
01:16:22 -  and a new beginning hope for Germany hope for Israel
01:16:28 -  that is hope indeed the triumphant life of Christ that death could not contain
01:16:42 -  which Jews had never seen in your midst we'll see now thank you Lord
01:16:54 -  thank you Lord thank you precious God look upon us
01:17:08 -  this is not a sentimental gesture this is not a religious response this is significant response
01:17:24 -  for those who have heard your word seal it in heaven put an end to the natural life
01:17:36 -  to the religious life to the charismatic life to the well-meaning life
01:17:42 -  to the polite life and be radical be raised up in this people
01:17:52 -  that they might lift their voice as a trumpet that they might lift their voice as a trumpet to tell Israel its sins
01:18:02 -  Jacob his transgressions and Germany its error its false ambition
01:18:16 -  its continuing imperialist desire for God has appointed a day in which he will judge all nations
01:18:32 -  by that man whom he has raised from the dead let your voice be heard in this earth God
01:19:00 -  whether you were sprinkled with water or baptized and immersed God is not interested in the form
01:19:14 -  he is interested in the reality made possible by his own death and resurrection to receive this opportunity to join him
01:19:28 -  in the waters of death that you might be raised to newness of life more than politeness
01:19:40 -  rehearse this with him you who are down on your knees Lord
01:19:50 -  I receive my baptism though I didn't understand it then I understand it now
01:20:02 -  and I receive it as my death I am buried with you and when I get up from my knees
01:20:14 -  I fully expect to experience the resurrection the newness of life
01:20:22 -  new thought, new expression new impulse new courage
01:20:28 -  new love that's really love beyond sentiment that can be offended against
01:20:38 -  and not fail for it is your love your unconditional love
01:20:44 -  that Israel needs to experience by those who will convey it for they are in your life
01:20:56 -  Lord I seal these children unto the resurrection and raise up in this church
01:21:06 -  an intention beyond anything that men have conceived maybe for the first time in the history
01:21:12 -  of the church in Germany an apostolic church whose foundations are immovable
01:21:24 -  for whom the kingdom has come beyond the petty religious ambitions of men for whom the kingdom has come
01:21:36 -  beyond the petty religious ambitions of men because they have repented unto death
01:21:46 -  even of their own design for the church that your kingdom might come seal it
01:21:56 -  perform it be glorified by it let this night be historic
01:22:04 -  for the church of Jesus Christ in this nation that Israel might be blessed
01:22:20 -  and your soul gratified and your name glorified before all nations
01:22:34 -  thy kingdom come is our cry and our belief
01:22:42 -  our real hope in Jesus name we pray amen
01:22:52 -  give him priestly praise not something out of your mind just your spirit
01:23:02 -  let it flow freely all obstructions removed they have been brought to death
01:23:10 -  your self-consciousness give God your voice express your gratitude
01:23:18 -  for such a great salvation that he has made possible through our identification with him
01:23:26 -  in death and resurrection let's lift up our voices beyond charismatic praise
01:23:36 -  priestly praise uninhibited full of God himself
01:23:44 -  God celebrating God through a people whose life is not their own whose praise is not their own
01:23:54 -  whose prayers are not their own whose prayers are not their own for whom to live as Christ
01:24:08 -  for whom to worship as Christ for whom to serve as Christ give him your voices
01:24:18 -  in priestly praise Thank you Lord Thank you Lord
01:24:30 -  our praise is not their own Thank you Lord our praise is not their own
