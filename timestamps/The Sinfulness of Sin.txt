The Sinfulness of Sin

00:00 -  And the text is Psalm 51, which is not often considered. I wonder if it's ever considered at all, that David passed through such a searing time
00:15 -  in the revelation of his own condition as a sinner and gave us such a statement as he has of the anatomy of repentance and contrition and brokenness,
00:25 -  such as not to be found elsewhere in Scripture. That it's David himself who is doing it is a remarkable phenomenon,
00:35 -  because this is Israel's king and the sweet singer of Israel and the beloved of God, lamenting and ruining the fact that he had fallen
00:47 -  into adultery and into murder. And what's more, after he had committed those heinous sins and crimes, was not at all perturbed about it until
00:59 -  the prophet had to tell him a little story of a man who was wronged and took advantage of someone weak
01:06 -  and usurped his single lamb, something like that, and then said, Thou ought the man. And he was stabbed through,
01:14 -  and that opened a whole floodgate of recognition of the magnitude of his sin. So why am I saying all that?
01:23 -  This deserves supreme attention, because we are, all of us, living beneath the recognition of sin,
01:34 -  the iniquity of sin and the terror of sin. And if you miss it there, you miss it everywhere. Everything rises and falls with the recognition
01:43 -  of the enormity and the magnitude of what sin itself is. And if sin is lessened and made trivial and not even recognized as sin or as evil,
01:56 -  everything else suffers loss. What then does atonement mean? What is the cross?
02:02 -  What is Christ and his work if there's not a formidable thing that needs to be overcome through his death?
02:10 -  But if we don't think it's formidable, then the whole thing falls into a little patsy pablum of easily quoted
02:19 -  doctrines and statements and corresponding choruses, as we've heard tonight, without real penetration or conviction,
02:27 -  and dooms us to the lamentable, pathetic culture that we are. We've got to go back to the great issue of sin.
02:39 -  There may be other texts that would lend themselves to it, and maybe the Lord will employ it between today, tonight, and tomorrow,
02:46 -  but I know that we have to begin tonight with Psalm 51, just before I pray. How many people have only a scant remembrance of that Psalm?
02:58 -  Yeah, okay, good, see? Okay, what then can you know about the truth of your own condition
03:09 -  if you've not seen it in David? If David could fall to such unbelievable depths of what are we not capable?
03:20 -  And the fact that you have not fallen, is that a proof that you have a higher moral quality than King David?
03:26 -  Or you have been spared by circumstance and you have not had to face temptations of a comparable kind?
03:32 -  See what I mean? These things are written for our ratification. So Lord, we're asking
03:39 -  Holy Ghost exposition of this remarkable cry, Lord. God forbid that we should read it
03:51 -  and handle it in such a way as to reinforce our present shallowness, and that would be a facetious mishandling of the Word,
04:02 -  and that we ourselves should not be stricken. The only appropriate response to that great cry is our own cry.
04:11 -  So I'm asking my God for that Holy Ghost assistance that only you can give,
04:17 -  that you did not think it extravagant to withhold Israel's chiefest king and the one whom you called beloved
04:25 -  and a man after your own heart, and allow him to fall in such a pattern of disgrace, of transgression and iniquity,
04:34 -  that would serve to instruct every successive generation since, that we have not been instructed,
04:42 -  is a lamentable statement of our present condition, our neglect of your Word, and other things that you know only too well.
04:52 -  So Lord, come, precious God, and let your Word penetrate us into our deeds. Show us what the vile thing is,
05:02 -  transgression, sin, iniquity, my God, evil, and that there's no man good, no man exempt, and that if we have missed such humiliation
05:14 -  and embarrassing conditions, it's only circumstance, chance, and that you're waiting for the greater acknowledgement
05:28 -  on our part that does not wait to fall into those sins in order to acknowledge them. So we give you praise, glory, and honor, Lord.
05:36 -  As we turn to this holy text, out of the anguish of the soul of your beloved David, in Jesus' name, amen.
05:46 -  Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy.
05:55 -  Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
06:03 -  For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you alone have I sinned,
06:11 -  and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment.
06:19 -  Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me. You desire truth in the inward being parts.
06:28 -  Therefore, teach me wisdom in my secret heart. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
06:37 -  Let me hear joy and gladness. Let the bones that you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins,
06:43 -  and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.
06:51 -  Do not cast me away from your presence. Do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
06:59 -  and sustain me with a willing spirit. Then will I teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
07:07 -  Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your deliverance.
07:14 -  O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. For you have no delight in sacrifice.
07:22 -  If I were to give a burnt offering, you would not be pleased. The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit,
07:28 -  a broken and contrite heart. O God, you will not despise. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure.
07:36 -  Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Then you will delight in right sacrifices and burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.
07:43 -  Then bulls will be offered on your altar. Amen. Well,
07:56 -  if mercy is for us only an academic acknowledgement and something that we assume that we have received in salvation,
08:08 -  but is not the cogent blessing for which David is crying out of its depths in order to receive,
08:17 -  we have nothing to say and nothing to offer the Jew in their last days' extremity.
08:23 -  See, I have a vested interest in the things that issue from this whole awareness of our own desperate condition,
08:34 -  our own depravity, or else we just present to them a bunch of smug religionists.
08:42 -  What's the word? Priggish. We are just religious prigs
08:52 -  who are smug and self-satisfied. And we'll look down upon Jews with a certain kind of spiritual superiority
09:02 -  and completely miss the historic encounter for which God is presently moving. We will not be in a position to extend mercy
09:11 -  because the fact of the matter is we have never received it. You only receive mercy
09:18 -  when you are at wit's end and utterly desperate in the awareness of a condition
09:26 -  that if God does not meet it, you're finished, you're a dead duck, you cannot go on,
09:32 -  you're burning with shame, you cannot bear to remember your iniquity and to remember that you performed it
09:39 -  in God's sight. He says that, that against you alone have I sinned
09:47 -  and done with his evil in your sight. You were there when I handled another man's wife
09:54 -  and undressed her and sank my fingers into her flesh and more and did not cringe
10:02 -  and even forgot that I'm not to covet my neighbor's wife, which is one of the Ten Commandments, and that the book of Proverbs are full
10:12 -  that the touch of another man's wife is to welcome death. David somehow was oblivious
10:20 -  to what he should have known as the sweet singer of Israel, oblivious to the command,
10:26 -  so intoxicated with the beauty of this woman, so having to have this rapturous delight that he did not even think
10:34 -  that God was somehow aware, let alone present and seeing. Think on that, you saints.
10:40 -  Maybe you're guilty of the same thing. Do you think that God knows when you take liberties
10:47 -  and pull a boo-boo? When you lie, when you're deceitful, when you harbor in your heart thoughts
10:54 -  that ought not to be there, or other practices or speech or conduct that is unbecoming to a saint
11:01 -  that he's not aware? Think of what sin is. Sin is a remarkable presumption
11:11 -  against God. What it's saying is, you're not really God.
11:17 -  You're not really all-seeing and omniscient and all-knowing and all-present. Therefore, I can take this liberty
11:24 -  and cut this corner and do this satisfying thing, because you're not there to observe it.
11:33 -  To say that God is not there is to say that God is not God. Got the point?
11:42 -  So we are daily denying God as God and come here in the evening and watch the overhead projector
11:49 -  and sing all these songs about His embrace. What shall I call it? Pap? It's not that the innocuous language
12:00 -  of these songs does not condemn them in themselves, but that we're singing them
12:07 -  as if we're in that relationship when we're every day and almost hour by hour violating the most essential
12:14 -  acknowledgment of God as God. I think we can sing our way through that, talk about an embrace.
12:22 -  We're heaping insult upon injury and defaming God as if not only was He not there
12:30 -  when we acted deceitfully, but as if He's not here when we're singing deceitfully.
12:38 -  You know what? Is there a word for that? I don't have a word for it. Is it culture?
12:46 -  Would to God, for me in my house, I would rather blot out the church.
12:52 -  I would rather remove services than we should perform something of this kind that reinforces us in our deceit
13:00 -  and dulls us in our inability even to discern the truth of our own condition as sinners. We've never burned like David.
13:10 -  And don't think that it demands capital sin in order to feel the blot of it. Because sin is sin.
13:20 -  And in God's sight, there's not major or minor, greater or lesser transgressions. Because the nature of sin, as I've said,
13:28 -  is presumption against God. Whether you're fornicating with someone or not,
13:34 -  it's presumption against God. Whether you're fornicating with someone else's wife, singing to the man's murder,
13:40 -  or sticking your hand in the collection box, or acting deceitfully at work, or complimenting people
13:47 -  to smooth away for a transaction for a sale, it has the same nub, the same essence, the same essential ingredients
13:55 -  that constitute sin as sin. And in fact, if you've not moved on to major sin, the progression will bring you there.
14:05 -  If you're allowing, quote, minor transgressions, and you can dismiss them because you have a relative scale by which you evaluate it,
14:13 -  who are you to evaluate it? Who are you to say it's minor? Who are you, God,
14:20 -  that you can assess the moral consequence of an act? You're heaping presumption upon presumption.
14:32 -  So, God's yet to hear our cry for mercy. Maybe He'll hear it tonight. Maybe this is the beginning of breaking in,
14:44 -  where we acknowledge, my God, I need mercy
14:51 -  because I cannot bear this acknowledgment that against you and you alone have I sinned,
14:58 -  and I've done this evil thing in your sight, as if you were not there to see,
15:04 -  or if you did see, you didn't care because you don't have that kind of highfalutin moral sensibility
15:10 -  of the kind that I have. I'm really more moral than you are, because I would probably have been offended,
15:18 -  but you're not offended, so you're less a God than is ascribed to you.
15:26 -  Understand the implications. Understand the implications. As if our moral sensitivity
15:34 -  is greater than his, because if he was there, he didn't take note of it,
15:40 -  so evidently it didn't offend him. Maybe he's just saving it up for the day of judgment.
15:46 -  Won't you be surprised then that what you thought were trifles were dutifully recorded in his book,
15:52 -  and you'll have to stand before him in that day and give answer of the things that you've done in your body,
15:58 -  both good and bad? There's no sense of that in the Church. No sense of impending judgment.
16:05 -  No sense that one day we shall be required of. God's a sport.
16:11 -  He's a pretty, you know, easygoing kind of a deity, because that's the kind we like,
16:18 -  and reinforces us in our way, and we are assured that he's one of the boys.
16:25 -  Although the Scripture warns us that God's condemnation of Israel was, you thought I was such a one as yourself.
16:35 -  You, dear young saps, need to know that God is other than what you think he is.
16:46 -  That's what you need to know. Profoundly other. And for us to use phrases
16:52 -  like holy, holy, holy, and to come out of our mouths like so much stew
16:58 -  denigrates holiness itself. We can't use that word until we've seen him high and lifted up
17:05 -  and cry out. Holiness is... I don't have a word for what I'm about.
17:15 -  Can you see that? Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love,
17:22 -  according to your abundant mercy, because if it's according to me, I'm finished.
17:28 -  There's no hope. The only one upon whom I can cast myself in any chance
17:34 -  of getting this vile thing expelled from my consciousness, my memory,
17:40 -  my heart that is burning with shame is if you expunge it. I'm cast upon you with a desperation
17:47 -  of a kind that I have never before known or needed to know so long as I thought that my life
17:53 -  was relatively reasonable and pleasing in your sight. But now,
17:59 -  when I see what in fact I am and am capable of, unless you forgive,
18:05 -  unless you exercise mercy, unless you expunge and blot out my transgressions
18:11 -  and wash me thorough from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, I'm a goner.
18:17 -  My nights are just filled with horrible images and restlessness
18:23 -  and my peace has departed. I can't praise, I can't sing, I can't have any kind of morning
18:29 -  communion with you, coming to the Lord's table is drinking sickness
18:35 -  and delphin to myself. So long as this condition remains unattended by you,
18:41 -  I am for all effects and purposes out of commission and I'm Israel's king
18:47 -  and supposed to be the model of what you are. I'm the earthly equivalent of what you are in heaven
18:53 -  and if they see me in this condition, how will that reflect upon you and your majesty?
18:59 -  I'm desperate. And God waits to hear that note of desperation.
19:07 -  For I know my transgression. Tell you what, you dear saints,
19:13 -  don't pray for anything else. Don't pray for ministry, don't pray for doors to open,
19:19 -  don't pray for the success of your musical group or the increase of church, pray for this.
19:25 -  I want to know my transgression. I want to know the truth of my condition, not as
19:31 -  I see it, but as you see it. Because if I'm my own judge, I will invariably let myself off the hook.
19:37 -  I will invariably find justification. It wasn't adultery, it was love
19:43 -  and you know the way it is, Lord, and I've had a disappointing marital history and this lady came
19:49 -  who's once won in a lifetime and true that she was also married, but unhappily, but when we
19:55 -  came together, Lord, you know what it was, it was extravagant music, it was ethereal. Surely you had to be
20:01 -  in it. You know what man is? In his deception, in his artifice,
20:07 -  in his ability to gild and purvey things in such
20:13 -  a way as he comes out smelling like a rose? We need to know the truth of our condition as God sees it. Ask
20:21 -  God for the moral stamina to bear that revelation. Because when it came to a
20:27 -  prophet by the name of Isaiah, whose heads and shoulders above you, in every way, the man came
20:33 -  undone and cried out, what was me?
20:39 -  I'm a man of unclean lips and I'm living in the midst of the people of unclean lips because I've seen the Lord
20:45 -  not as I thought him to be in a acceptable
20:51 -  format that reinforces my status quo. I saw him as he in fact is, high
20:57 -  and lifted up, which means to say impaled on a cross. I saw the face of the Lord battered.
21:03 -  I saw it blood spattered. I saw that he had no beauty that any should desire him.
21:09 -  And seeing him in that condition, I have seen God as God. I have seen
21:15 -  the majesty of God in the suffering of this one. And seeing him like
21:21 -  that, I see myself. In fact, until I see him like that, there's no seeing of myself.
21:29 -  To see yourself independent of God is a formula for deception. Or to see yourself relative to other believers,
21:35 -  you'll always come out heads and shoulders above the rest. But to see yourself in the light of
21:41 -  God as he in fact is, is to cry out I'm undone.
21:47 -  When I preached this recently, I said, you don't have to wait to say I'm a man of unclean lips.
21:53 -  The problem is, I'm a man. I've seen the Lord high and lifted up and I'm
21:59 -  a man. And being a man, my lips unnecessarily defiled. Being a man,
22:05 -  I speak facetiously. Being a man, I'm seductive and corrupt. Being a minister,
22:11 -  I'm a glad speaker and a and a toothsome, sweet,
22:17 -  able manipulator using words and tones and attitudes
22:23 -  that serve my purposes. Being a man means
22:29 -  necessarily your mouth is corrupt. Until you've cried out about being a
22:37 -  man, you've not cried out. Something intrinsic in man
22:43 -  for which present day Christendom is little embarrassed to acknowledge there's such a thing as
22:49 -  the doctrine of depravity. What's the whole word, Reg?
22:55 -  Ultimate depravity or total depravity? Total depravity.
23:01 -  There's no space. It's total. Total depravity. We're
23:07 -  rotten through and through. Where's there a man, a righteous man upon the Earth who doeth good and sinneth not?
23:13 -  Where is one who seeks my face? The Old Testament is full of illusions that
23:19 -  there's not one. That the religious are the worst malefactors. And in fact was proven
23:25 -  by the fact that they themselves took the life of their own Messiah. That the most religious
23:31 -  and the most pious and the prized student of Rabbi Gamaliel was the chief persecutor.
23:37 -  That in the self-righteousness of a religious man is the evil that eventuates
23:43 -  in persecution and murder. Hey, what more testimony do you need? You think
23:51 -  you're better than Saul? Better than David? Have you surrendered to the truth
23:57 -  that God says is the foundation of the humanity
24:03 -  we all inhabit? That there's no man good?
24:09 -  Oh, I know you've had seductive thoughts that something special about you and the way you twangle guitar or
24:17 -  I don't know what that the Lord needs and wants and you're
24:23 -  pathetic. We're dust, you dear saints, helpless,
24:29 -  pathetic, deadly, sinners, capable of no good and no righteousness. We don't even
24:35 -  know what righteousness is. We don't even seek it. We don't salivate at the
24:41 -  mention of the word. We rarely ever invoke it. We don't love righteousness and hate iniquity. We refer
24:47 -  to Jesus doing that, but it's not incumbent upon us. We have little or no moral sense
24:53 -  at all. Do you know that? When I say we, you're just the victims who are
24:59 -  sitting in front of me. I mean the church at large of which you're not exempt.
25:05 -  You're part. And it's a rare soul who sees like this and cries out like this. And one
25:11 -  of them is A.W. Tozer who writes, there's a grief in my spirit when I
25:17 -  go into the average church, for we have become a generation rapidly losing all
25:23 -  sense of divine sacredness in our worship. Many whom we have raised in our churches no longer
25:29 -  think in terms of reverence, which seems to indicate they doubt that God's presence is there.
25:35 -  Churches become humdrum, predictable, bland choruses,
25:41 -  sung without appropriate conviction, although we can get ourselves into a bit of an emotional
25:47 -  state. But it's a grief to Tozer and I think it's a grief to God
25:53 -  because the sense of what is divine and sacred is out. We've never had it
25:59 -  and our condition is so lamentable we're not even aware that we lack it and we think that we can complement
26:05 -  and supplement its absence by something that we can perform or we can create. Again, the
26:11 -  sin of presumption against God. The sense of the sacred is only something that God Himself
26:17 -  can give. We can never fabricate it. We would be better off to shut our
26:23 -  mouths and pull the plug out of our equipment and wait on God in holy silence
26:29 -  if He will have mercy upon us and give us a sense of Himself as He in fact is, that we might
26:35 -  begin to understand what reverence and fear is. We become a bunch of practitioners
26:47 -  and whole churches are built on the quality of their so-called worship.
26:53 -  He writes in the majority of our meetings there's scarcely a trace of reverent thought, no recognition
26:59 -  of the unity of the body, little sense of the divine presence, no moment of stillness, no solemnity, no
27:05 -  wonder, no holy fear. We just got a question at IHOP because I had made
27:13 -  reference to the fear of God. What is it art? And how do you recognize it when it comes
27:19 -  and how is it to be obtained? I love the question because it acknowledges it's
27:25 -  so totally absent from our consideration. And I can just say whatever my little testimony
27:31 -  is worth, in 41 years in the faith and traveling the world over in churches of every description
27:37 -  and in the best of churches, the fear of God is absent. If it were
27:43 -  present, we would be biting our tongues. We would be speaking less. We would be
27:49 -  chorusing less. We would be on our faces more. There's not the reverent sense of God
27:55 -  as God. And I don't know what to say about it or cry about it or how to obtain
28:01 -  it, except that we acknowledge our pitiful condition and ask His mercy.
28:07 -  Lest we go on playing church and affecting little or nothing.
28:13 -  That was Tozer's cry in the 1960s. There's
28:19 -  no solemnity, no wonder, no holy fear. And so often there's a dull or a breezy
28:25 -  song lead full of awkward jokes as well as a chairman announcing each quote number unquote
28:31 -  with the old radio continuity pattern in an effort to make everything hang together. We've all seen this.
28:37 -  Maybe we've all practiced it. A succession of choruses most times without even a comment from
28:43 -  one chorus to the other. Why? Because we really haven't anything to say.
28:49 -  That's in keeping with what we are ostensibly singing. We don't have someone
28:55 -  who comes to us out from the presence of God and has been on His face and knows
29:01 -  the sense of the holiness of God and the fear of God and can interject a word here and there in that
29:07 -  song service that saves us from just being a patter of repetitious choruses.
29:21 -  The most pressing need just now is that we who call ourselves Christians should frankly acknowledge to each other and to God
29:27 -  that we are a stray. That we should confess that we are worldly, that our moral
29:33 -  standards are low, and that we are spiritually cold. We need to cease our multitude of
29:39 -  unscriptural activities, stop running when and where we have not been sent, cease trying to sanctify
29:45 -  carnal projects by professing that we are promoting them in the name of the Lord and for the glory of God.
29:51 -  How dare you sanctify your carnal ambition by invoking God's name?
29:57 -  Doesn't your shame ever catch up with you? How dare you use the word
30:03 -  prophet and apostle when you have the faintest notion of what it in fact means and
30:09 -  bandy it about as if it's the latest vogue that we could articulate and mouth at will.
30:17 -  That's taking the Lord's name in vain. This is presumption that becomes
30:23 -  blasphemy and we're so accustomed to it that we don't even blush. In fact, blushing itself is
30:29 -  a lost art. So when I spoke in, what's
30:35 -  that country, I always forget the name, 70 years under communist rule at the very southern end
30:41 -  of Europe. It begins with an A. Armenia.
30:47 -  A German mission, they had me to speak to the high school teachers who were secular.
30:53 -  They were sponsoring the high school and paying the bill. I'm a former high school teacher myself.
31:01 -  What was the subject the Lord gave? The word moral.
31:07 -  I said to those teachers, and the whole church needs to hear this, do you realize that teaching is
31:13 -  a moral vocation? I'm saying to secular teachers that to teach
31:19 -  is not to disseminate mere information. To teach is to raise questions of an ultimate
31:25 -  and a moral kind that have to do with the issues of what is good, what is true,
31:31 -  what is righteous, what is to be desired, what is reality, and that
31:37 -  if you remove from men the moral quotient, you not only degrade men, you remove their humanity
31:43 -  altogether. To be moral is to be a man. And the more moral you are
31:49 -  in the disposition of your soul, and view every act and conduct
31:55 -  from the moral perspective, how is this pleasing in God's sight,
32:01 -  forwarding his purposes, not does it work? Does it succeed? Will I enjoy the benefit?
32:07 -  What is the moral issue at stake in buying something that you're well
32:13 -  able to afford? But morally speaking, what's your habit? Who thinks
32:19 -  like that? And the avoidance of that thinking is reflected in the debased
32:27 -  condition of the Church that lacks a sense of righteousness. How can it talk about
32:33 -  a God that's holy and revere him and fear him when in its own life and conduct
32:39 -  it does not even take into consideration the most elementary things pertaining to what is moral?
32:45 -  That needs to be revived, saints. And you know what? If you go to the dictionary tonight, you'll not find an adequate
32:51 -  answer. Either for the word moral, or for the word righteous, or for the word holy. These
32:57 -  are the great words that you don't obtain through dictionaries in definition. These are the words that
33:03 -  you apprehend, and that apprehend you. Got that?
33:09 -  That you intuit. That's in keeping with the growth of your moral character and your sensitivity
33:15 -  toward God. And the integrity of your life and the carefulness with which you're walking and
33:21 -  speaking, and the acknowledgement that you're a sinner being saved by grace. That you're a man
33:27 -  of unclean lips. How great is God's love to take
33:33 -  Israel's choicest king, who is the sweet singer of Israel,
33:39 -  God's greatest psalmist, and who reveals in these songs such an extraordinary
33:45 -  intimacy in the knowledge of God, and allow him to fall into this
33:51 -  most heinous sin, and to allow him to go unperturbed
33:57 -  for a season until the prophet himself pegs him, and then to evoke this cry.
34:03 -  That he's willing to humiliate his choicest servant, and allow him to go
34:09 -  through sin and transgression in order to bring him to a place of contrition and repentance
34:15 -  that would be a model for every subsequent generation, except ours.
34:21 -  That's how important God thought the question. He gave us two Davids. The David who
34:27 -  exposed sin in his own failure and acknowledges it, against the in the alone have I sinned,
34:33 -  and the David who came to requite that sin by being high and lifted up
34:39 -  in unbelievable anguish of body and soul. Because Karl Barth says,
34:45 -  no man can begin to estimate what sin is until he sees
34:51 -  what has been required to expiate it. Got the picture? Until you see
34:57 -  how far the father had to go to expiate sin, you don't know nothing yet.
35:03 -  You have just subscribed to conventional wisdom and to a body of
35:09 -  nomenclature and correct doctrine, but it has not pierced you.
35:15 -  It's not become through reality. It has not evoked from you a cry for the mercy of God.
35:21 -  And therefore, if you've missed the reality of sin, where have you found reality
35:27 -  at all? If you've not found reality at the point of sin, where have you
35:33 -  found it? Well, little wonder you have gone on from unreality to unreality
35:39 -  in your choruses, in your so-called worship, and the whole decorum of the Church.
35:45 -  It's unreal until we get back to the foundation of the truth
35:51 -  of our condition as God sees it and desires that it be known based on
35:57 -  the revelation of himself as he has paid what is required to expiate
36:03 -  it. Sin is more evil than you know. Of course, you don't even know evil. You're suckers
36:09 -  and easily influenced and you're quite comfortable in the world.
36:15 -  Only a few characters like me are chafed and can't bear it, not only for its flagrant
36:21 -  evil, but for its mentality and its culture and its advertisements
36:27 -  and the kind of soothing things that go along from the classroom to the
36:33 -  TV channel to the newspapers and magazines that there's a conspiracy.
36:39 -  Can you cover your mouth, sis, at least when you're young? Try covering your mouth. Because the speaker always
36:45 -  interprets that as boredom. And you can't afford to be bored over this subject. Where was I?
36:51 -  There's a conspiracy against truth, against reality.
36:57 -  And that which is evil purports to be good and is depicted as good
37:03 -  and is accepted as good, not just by the numb world, but even
37:09 -  by Christians more than we are aware. You don't know evil until you can
37:15 -  see it in the face of apparent good. I yanked out the TV set years ago from my house
37:21 -  when I saw all of the kids of the community clustered around in the dark room, glued
37:27 -  to that screen, and they weren't watching porno. We only have one channel up in Minnesota. They were watching a
37:33 -  drama about the Olympics of a romance between an American male
37:39 -  athlete and a Russian woman. But the concept of romance that was
37:45 -  being set forth was so of the world, was so vile, was so
37:51 -  soulish, was so untrue and unreal, and these kids were sucking it up
37:57 -  as if this were coming right from the throne of heaven itself as uttermost reality.
38:03 -  Well, my son, who was one of those who sucked it up, has now divorced his wife
38:09 -  and will not be reprimanded and thinks that he's doing God's service, not Jesus,
38:15 -  but God, because he's emancipated from an unhappy marital
38:21 -  situation to which he need not submit, forgetting that there's such a thing as covenant
38:27 -  and that God hates divorce and covenant breakers, he has fashioned for himself
38:33 -  a rationale of self-justification by which he has severed a relationship that leave
38:39 -  his three children dangling between one parent and the other, because his lust
38:45 -  for another woman who has come up off the sidelines is presently
38:51 -  so attractive. I wonder how far back that goes to what they were sucking out of the
38:57 -  TV tube in those early years that either we didn't correct or we didn't recognize
39:03 -  what was, what pervasive thing was going into their systems and would one day eventuate itself
39:09 -  in such tragedy as we're now unhappy to relate.
39:15 -  Divorce is as common in the church as it is in the world. No fear.
39:21 -  No fear that God hates something and if he hates it, isn't that enough
39:27 -  reason to put aside every thought of your unhappiness
39:33 -  and if he's a covenant-keeping God, however unpropitious
39:41 -  the present marriage seems, isn't he able to take the worst elements of it and turn it to the good
39:47 -  if you remain bonded in covenant agreement with him? Well, I'm believing for that 42 years
39:55 -  later and we've not yet seen daylight out of the tunnel but I believe not only will we
40:01 -  see it, that when it comes in God's honoring of covenantal faith
40:07 -  that the issue will be more than just domestic harmony that is finally obtained but the glorification of
40:13 -  God because the reason your marriage has gone asunder is that your
40:19 -  prime criteria for its evaluation was your happiness and not his glory. Your happiness,
40:25 -  your satisfaction, your gratification while you still have your looks.
40:31 -  Where's God who is Lord, who has saved us out of death
40:37 -  and that our life is not our own? How all of a sudden has it become our own if we're being frustrated
40:45 -  sexually and the wife is no longer, what's the word, cooperative and she has moods and
40:51 -  that we don't even realize we ourselves are the ones who have perverted the whole atmosphere that make
40:57 -  her to be intimate with us and agony against her own integrity
41:03 -  and if we compel, we're brutes because how shall we be sensitive
41:11 -  to what God has made in his image where we're not sensitive to the God who has made them in his image
41:17 -  and don't see that there's a life fluttering there that we ourselves are despoiling
41:23 -  and brutalizing and running over because we're so taken up with ourselves and our own satisfaction
41:29 -  and not held accountable. You don't have to make explanation
41:35 -  if the church itself will not continue to receive you, others will. Divorce is not so great a scandal,
41:41 -  it's a commonplace. So he cries out in verse 5, indeed I was
41:47 -  born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me. Oh so that's it, now we know your problem David.
41:53 -  Your mother probably was in a compromised moral condition
41:59 -  in that night when she cohabited with your dad and therefore you were conceived in iniquity.
42:05 -  Well that's the way you Americans would think. But it's not so.
42:11 -  He was conceived in iniquity because we are all in iniquity and that he was born guilty
42:19 -  he says. There's something intrinsic in man himself that's Adamic,
42:25 -  that's vile, that is utterly opposed to God but can be trained to be domesticized
42:31 -  and learn to say the right things and be polite about God but be effectively its own lord
42:37 -  even while it calls him lord. He's recognizing that his problem goes much deeper than
42:45 -  Bathsheba. His problem goes back to his birth.
42:51 -  Bathsheba only revealed what was always the truth of his life, that he's a man
42:57 -  and capable of iniquity, given the right circumstance and occasion.
43:03 -  He proved it. And God will prove it with you
43:09 -  unless you vicariously identify with David and say if he was capable
43:15 -  what shall I say? Am I made of better stuff? We need a new birth,
43:21 -  a clean heart and a new spirit when God will have
43:27 -  blotted out our transgression and washed us and created in us
43:33 -  something altogether other than what we were from our inception. That
43:43 -  atom has got to bite the dust. And it's amazing how few
43:49 -  have seen to it in their own baptism in water if in fact they were really
43:55 -  baptized rather than sprinkled. But how many that were immersed
44:01 -  really had such a consciousness of the depth of their Adamic taint, the
44:07 -  innate corruption in their humanity not just in their boo-boos and in their worst devices
44:13 -  but in their virtue. It's your virtue that finds you out. It's the things that
44:19 -  you celebrate and want to retain that show the essence of that which is of man and contrary to God.
44:25 -  And unless you're willing to bring that to death, you can forget about being raised unto a newness of
44:31 -  life. How many believers are there who are so aware of the
44:37 -  truth of their condition and so despise it and know that no correction, no discipline, no lying on a
44:43 -  bed of nails, no amount of discipleship is ever going to alter this. This is stubborn.
44:49 -  This is pervasive. This is intrinsic. This is me as man. This is
44:55 -  from Adam and there's no freedom from it except by death at the cross and
45:01 -  the provision God has made for it that only death itself could meet. Follow me?
45:07 -  We have made a sham of baptism. We've made a sham of the Lord's
45:13 -  table. The sacraments have become trivialized. Why? Because God himself is
45:19 -  trivialized. His worship is trivialized. Our sermonizing is trivializing. The way we conduct
45:25 -  ourselves without the fear and reverence and awe of God, of necessity,
45:31 -  trivializes God. How then shall the sacraments be made exempt? If
45:37 -  you've not met death in the crucifixion and burial with Christ,
45:43 -  your Adam is very much alive. He's just only learned how to be
45:49 -  cover up and be made polite and religious and
45:55 -  inoffensive until the Lord will reveal
46:01 -  something again to your shame. He did it for a whole nation,
46:07 -  Germany, and made Israel the revelation of its depravity.
46:13 -  Lutheran though it was, Reformation nation though it was,
46:19 -  it was capable of the systematic annihilation of God's ancient people and
46:25 -  that without a twinge of conscience. Their nominal Lutheranism did not save them from
46:31 -  bestiality and it will not save you either. What happened with
46:37 -  Katrina and the bursting of the dams in New Orleans and people being
46:43 -  crunched into the, what do you call it, the arena there? Rape, murder,
46:49 -  what do you call it, mass rape, children
46:55 -  going into the john are victimized. Only one black pastor
47:01 -  whose statement I carry cries out that the black community of New Orleans
47:07 -  failed in its moral responsibility when the crisis came and all
47:13 -  semblance of order was removed and even the police forsook their positions. Men acted like
47:19 -  animals. Don't be shocked if conditions should come
47:25 -  in the world that is in process of collapse and restraints are removed to see how men
47:31 -  will conduct themselves and how you yourself might be tempted. Unless you love righteousness.
47:37 -  Unless there's something more important to you than your own self survival
47:43 -  you'll be victim. But that righteousness is not something you learn by discipline.
47:49 -  That righteousness is very God. Righteousness is God.
47:57 -  And we have him in as proportion as we have repented of unrighteousness, of the
48:03 -  Adamic life of its thought and particularly its religiously
48:09 -  amenable forms to which we have given ourselves much too mindlessly.
48:19 -  Keep your heart with all diligence. The book of Proverbs says for out of it
48:25 -  issue all, spring all the issues of life. You can't believe what I've paid to keep
48:31 -  my heart with all diligence. I've lost the publisher. I've lost the affiliations.
48:37 -  You stand out like a soft thumb when you can't go along. When your integrity
48:43 -  will not permit. When you're able to discern that which is
48:49 -  of the spirit and that which is a soulish counterfeit. And you cannot wear a smile with the counterfeit
48:55 -  and nod your head in agreement as if what is going forth is valid and of God. When it is
49:01 -  soulish, when it is manipulative, when the effect of it is to reinforce the immaturity of
49:07 -  saints and not bring them indeed to sonship. And if you don't go along, you will be visibly
49:15 -  in the place of objection. You'll be the square peg in the round hole.
49:21 -  Integrity costs something. Righteousness costs something. To be morally minded
49:27 -  costs something and it costs it continually. And right
49:33 -  now constitutes very little of our present consideration. Got the
49:39 -  picture? So just like
49:49 -  Isaiah who shall go for us? He answers, send me
49:55 -  and the Lord says go. Because his lips have
50:01 -  been purged. He's received the treatment from off the altar of God. God
50:07 -  agreed with Isaiah's cry that he's a man of unclean lips. He did not
50:13 -  say, hey, don't get carried away now. You're my number one prophet. You're the prince of the prophets. You've been prophesying for five chapters
50:19 -  grandly. Don't, just because you caught a little glimpse a little vision, get all
50:25 -  overworked and where you think yourself undone and that you're like Paul the less than the least
50:31 -  of all saints? God agreed with him. Or else why was the call taken from the
50:37 -  altar by the seraphim and put to his lips unless there was that agreement? So let me ask you, discerning
50:43 -  saints, if Isaiah required a purging
50:49 -  and God acknowledged that his cry was valid, that he was a man and therefore his mouth was
50:55 -  unclean by virtue of being a man and that this man also needs to have his sins
51:01 -  blotted out before he can say, I will teach transgressors
51:07 -  your ways, if these great men and the
51:13 -  Job that I've been reading today, I abhor myself, I repent in dust and ashes.
51:19 -  I heard by the ear and now my eyes see if I abhor myself. God says, good.
51:25 -  Now you've spoken rightly, but my anger is kindled against your so-called spiritual
51:31 -  comforters who are giving you a lot of blab who don't even really know me
51:37 -  and I've yet to hear from them what I've heard from you, that you abhor yourself. Because
51:43 -  in the light of my holiness, my righteousness and what I am as God,
51:49 -  every man ought to abhor himself. When I hear that, I'm requited.
51:55 -  Now you go pray for your comforters, lest my wrath come upon them.
52:01 -  If Job required that acknowledgement and David requires
52:07 -  the blotting out of his transgression and Isaiah the blotting out of his
52:13 -  unclean mouth with a cold, what do we require? Who have sung about the blood.
52:19 -  Without any real deep apprehension of the need to be
52:25 -  purged, that there are stains so indelible, transgressions so vile,
52:31 -  if not in act, at least in word and thought and ambition or rivalry or jealousy
52:37 -  or whatever, that we need to be purged by the power
52:43 -  of the blood, which is just a wishy-washy little noxious nothing
52:49 -  unless there's a real cry that quests that purging, that cries out,
52:55 -  purge me. Blot out my transgressions. When has the Lord heard that from us?
53:03 -  Because what transgressions have you had to blot out, you nice Kansas City kids?
53:09 -  What transgression? Who have you raped last? Are you going to wait for a rape
53:15 -  before you cry out? Or will you say, Lord, presently, if I've not raped,
53:21 -  it's only the grace of God and the mercy of God. But I know that if David was capable,
53:27 -  what shall I say? And I recognize the truth of that condition
53:33 -  in which I was born. I was born guilty. I was conceived in iniquity.
53:39 -  I'm still in that iniquity. And unless you blotted out a clean heart,
53:45 -  I will soon enough give evidence of this truth to my own eternal regret and shame.
53:51 -  Save me from it now by the power of what you have shed. And save me from just
53:57 -  what's the word? Making of it a shallow sham confession
54:05 -  and a little proper reference to the doctrines of the faith
54:11 -  that are not deeply felt or sought. Because we do not see ourselves
54:17 -  as sinners needing to be saved by the grace of God. If we miss the issue of sin, saints,
54:23 -  we have missed the issue. There's no hope for reality if we have not found it there.
54:33 -  So, enough ranting and raving. Shall we pray? Precious God on high.
54:43 -  Your mercy, Lord, is sending this aging man into the midst of this youthful
54:49 -  congregation with thoughts and reflections that seem
54:55 -  to come from the remotest place. But we thank you for our love,
55:01 -  Lord, that will not let us go. You know our condition, my God.
55:07 -  Let us follow as all get out. We don't have a message that's vibrant. We can't address sinners
55:13 -  unless we ourselves have been sinners and have been saved out of the depth
55:19 -  of transgression and evil and have come to love righteousness and hate iniquity
55:25 -  in any form. We avoid the world and don't want to in any way reflect it
55:31 -  consciously or unconsciously as if it's something we can toy with because it does not really reflect
55:37 -  the truth of our condition. It reflects it more than you know. You spend more time in your mirror
55:43 -  and evaluating what color dye that you're going to use for your hair and your eyelashes
55:49 -  than you've ever spent in devotion. We're worldlings and shallow
55:55 -  and we're even in the chorus. We're invited to participate.
56:01 -  My God, have mercy on us. Hear a cry for mercy not only for ourselves
56:09 -  but for the Church at large. Come, my God, in reality here at this level
56:15 -  in this place over this issue. Even tonight
56:21 -  if there's anyone who bears the faintest conviction
56:27 -  for transgression and iniquity that has not really been deeply acknowledged
56:33 -  nor mercy therefore received for it and that the evil nub yet remains
56:39 -  and makes one a potential
56:45 -  prospect for a future transgression then meet that one, my God
56:51 -  in the place of truth and integrity. You're generous in your mercy
56:57 -  to those who call out to you in sincerity and in truth. Come, my God
57:03 -  and hear as many cries and petitions
57:09 -  as saints are willing to make to you even this night in Jesus' name we pray.
