DVD 26 - Selling All Your Possessions by Art Katz

00:00 -  And we see the beauty of their lives, and their character, and their integrity, and we hear them speak their many languages, and see their intensity, and their passion, and their character, and their nature, and our hearts covet them for the kingdom of God, that they might be an end-time people of God, proclaiming his salvation throughout the earth. Sayeth the Lord, good evening, you dear saints. I hope you're not scared, and that you'll not be disappointed if I don't conform to your stereotyped expectation. After all, a man who is dressed like this can't be all that prophetic.
01:13 -  Lord, I'm privileged that a Jewish boy from Brooklyn, no longer boyish, is standing before a congregation of this kind in this city, in this Asia. Who would have thought, my God, in that early time, that such a thing as this would come to pass? Let my mother be in the cloud of invisible witnesses overhead, and enjoying the occasion, because she came to the knowledge of you ten days before passing this life, and is now up there with the saints of old, and relishing and cherishing that her son is a privileged servant, although for the first almost 40 years she was aggravated by the same thing that she now celebrates.
01:58 -  So thank you, Lord, for her passing from death to life, and let her enjoy her observing of us tonight in this place, and bring forth, Lord, something along the lines that my brother has prayed and expected. So we want to be astonished, not because we're looking to be titillated, but because we have very real need, Lord. The world is closing in all around us, and its spirit continually nips, my God, at our heels, and seeks to corrupt and to dissipate and weaken our faith and turn it into some kind of commodity,
02:42 -  just another piece of something that can be purchased and obtained and practiced, that will lose its vital prophetic and apostolic significance. So Lord, we're contending tonight for that precious faith, and ask Holy Ghost Assist, my God, to make this more than memorable, a pivotal statement, my God, that sinks deep into the foundations and against which every future thing will be aligned and considered. We're asking largely, Lord, our need is large, and we know you're able to answer.
03:18 -  So come and give us that remarkable grace and the prophets' reward, that even as our brother prayed, I had the remarkable Holy Ghost tingling and sense of your presence that you were saying amen, that whosoever will recognize the calling which I have bestowed will receive indeed that reward. So let it be, Lord, and we thank and give you praise for this occasion now.
03:45 -  Take it to yourself in full measure. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Well, I have before me my next newsletter article. We publish four times a year a modest little newsletter.
04:02 -  The circulation is so pitifully small that I hesitate even to announce it, but this is an occasion for me to use that article as a springboard to speak to you. I'm reading from Matthew chapter 19, verse 16.
04:41 -  I think that the same episode is also described in one or two other places in the Gospels. And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.
05:06 -  But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, honor thy father and thy mother, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The young man said unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up. What lack I yet?
05:31 -  Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
06:01 -  And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld them and said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
06:25 -  So Lord, kindle these verses and extract from them what is appropriate for our consideration tonight that will have a lasting and enduring effect on all of our continuation with you, all our future, my God. You're able, and we ask it, in Jesus' name. Amen. Well, I think in some other edition of this episode, the ruler just doesn't come and ask.
07:00 -  He comes running and asking, comes running and bowing and making concession and acknowledgement in an obsequious way. Excuse my language. A real deference to the Lord as a real teacher. And was very flattering, good master, honored teacher.
07:24 -  What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? So there's something that is struck from the first that deserves our closest attention. And not the least is that Jesus does not succumb to the seduction of flattery and acknowledges that the greeting is appropriate.
07:46 -  He will not allow himself to be acknowledged as good master or even as good. Because had he made that acknowledgement, some fundamental note will have been struck for all time that is of an ideological kind that dares not be conceded, which is to say that there's no man good, no, not one.
08:12 -  To receive that as compliment is to concede that it's true. And that it's a fundamental premise that we can accept and even make it foundational to our own life in God. But Jesus would not receive it and brought it into question immediately.
08:36 -  So the question itself, what must I do to inherit eternal life, is no small thing. But it's not just the issue of what lies beyond death. It's the issue of present life, the issue of continuance in God by the life of God.
08:52 -  Because the same life that is our privilege after death is the same life now that is the basis for our continuation before God. The issue is life. And maybe instead of saying what must I do to inherit, what must I do to acquire it? And the fact that he raises it as a question that he can accomplish by doing is already giving the game away.
09:17 -  It's already revealing a mentality of a certain kind, a Judaic mentality that has to do with things that men can attain by their own virtue, their own works, an attainment. What must I do? See, this thing is riddled with error right from the beginning.
09:35 -  The language of good man, good master, what must I do, is a dead giveaway. Where this man is coming from, what is his orientation, how does he understand God, life, reality? And these understandings are not so strange to us.
09:54 -  You don't have to be Jewish to subscribe even unconsciously to some kind of an attitude by which man deserves a certain kind of acknowledgement that there is something that he can do to inherit or to attain. And I want you to know that I'm personally fiercely opposed to so much as granting an iota of credibility to a mentality of that kind.
10:22 -  We need to spurn and disown anything by which man can think himself to be good, deserving, inheriting, acquiring by virtue of his merit or what he is in himself because this is a, what's the word, an exemplary young man. He's a ruler. This isn't just some Joe Blow off the street.
10:47 -  This is an exemplary piece of Jewish accomplishment and he acknowledges that he's kept all of these laws and all of these commandments from his youth up. What more do I lack? I have it all together. I'm complete in my religious attendance to the commandments themselves. And so the Lord says, well, just one thing do you lack?
11:11 -  And it's that one thing that makes or breaks everything for him and for us. And I'm supposing that we lack it and are not even aware of the deficiency and we're going on, even as Christians, even as charismatic Christians, more in the spirit and mentality of this young Jewish ruler than we know.
11:36 -  We need eternal life, dear saints, not after we pass this life, but we need it presently. For the eternal life is the life, the life of God. And we're called to live from it and through it because any other kind of service that has a source of energy,
11:59 -  a dynamism of an enablement that is not God's life is ipso facto rejected by God. And he'll not allow any performance of those things that pertain to his name, his glory, his honor and his purpose to be actuated by anything other than his own life. I think I'm not presuming upon God.
12:23 -  And in fact, if this message itself in my speaking is not being issued out from the life of God, then I myself am a contradiction in terms before you. But I trust in that. And the Lord seems to be faithful to continually supply and to be my enablement, even at my advanced age,
12:49 -  and to lay country after country before us in the space of weeks to go from one to another is more than just the issue of physical exertion or the deprivation that comes from long hours in airplanes and just finding a speaking occasion. Every speaking from my prophetic point of view is a once and for all that will not be given again.
13:15 -  And what preparation have we had today, just a waking less than a half hour from a nap before coming here, having had even a chance to review the text that I'm now employing and trusting that this little thing that I brought with me is God's text for tonight and that he'll quicken right on the spot and bring forth by the exercise of his own life what he wants through that text,
13:43 -  not just to entertain, amuse, or even instruct, or even inspire, but set forth something in the deeps by the promulgation of his word that will bring us down, that will devastate, that will set something in motion, that will be consequential for all the future, even eternity itself. You see how mad prophets are, how large are their expectations, and which is not altogether uncomely or improper.
14:12 -  The Lord does not frown on that kind of expectation. He intends it to be normative. And when you think in terms as large as that, it's something that cannot be accomplished even by a Jewish speaker. So what hope for you?
14:36 -  If the Apostle Paul had to frequently punctuate with groans and sighs the statement, who is sufficient for these things, what shall you say? The fact that you have not said it shows that you're living beneath the faith and the intention of God,
14:52 -  and that your Christian life is so predictable and tame that you can well conduct it on the basis of your own Singaporean ability, which is no small thing. Your schools have served you well and taught you how to be diligent, and your English is acceptable,
15:12 -  but hardly more. And you've been taught to exercise your own skill, your own ability, your own wit, and succeed on that basis, and you're doing admirably, if I can just judge it by the magnificent cars that are to be seen everywhere,
15:30 -  shining and gleaming, from the showroom floor, being operated by people evidently who have made it in life by the very skills that issue out of human self-sufficiency. So how have you avoided that trap?
15:51 -  How much do you resemble this young ruler in your secret mentality, which is being revealed to you tonight, more than you yourself knew, because you're unwilling and didn't realize that the only way in which his life can be conferred now, presently, for the purposes of God, is not to be rich, not to have possessions,
16:13 -  it's the willingness and the requirement to sell all that you have. And a few of us will go that far with God, and therefore we fall short of the remarkable provision, for the remarkable calling for which the world is wanting and hurting until it be established.
16:31 -  So the life of God is evidently not given until we also comply with the same requirement made of him, sell whatsoever thou hast. What a radical requirement to be made to a rich man. Not just part with some of it, not make a contribution of philanthropy,
16:55 -  but altogether, devoid, remove everything in which you could have had, any kind of confidence that will have sustained you, empty out, rob yourself, for whatever we have, however accomplished, is of man and keeps us from an absolute reliance on Jesus for our life.
17:24 -  Can you understand that? Any possession that we have, sell what thou hast, what you have as man, that you have attained by your own efficiency, your own credibility, your own diligence, now do without. You want life, you want eternal life, here's the condition, sell what thou hast,
17:48 -  because what you have is antithetical and opposed to what I am able to give you and incompatible. If you want the one, you have to avoid the other, you can't have both. My life is not a little addendum, it's not a little icing on the cake, it's the whole thing,
18:09 -  but I'm jealous, my life is holy and powerful and rich. Life is all-inclusive, it's such a term, it's not just energy, although it is profoundly that, but it's the wisdom of God, it's the mercy of God, it's the love of God, it's what God is in himself.
18:27 -  And you want that? Well, here's what is required, sell what you have, your possessions. Imagine if that's the requirement for us as much as it was the requirement for him. If you want an absolute reliance on Jesus for life, that whatsoever, that word, whatsoever thou hast,
18:51 -  is inclusive not only of possessions of a material kind, but our spiritual insights, our ministerial ability, even the best of our motives in serving the purposes of God. You thought it only meant carnal material things, that's kid stuff, it's easy to get rid of the BMW.
19:13 -  It won't be painless, but to get rid of your spiritual acquisitions that you possess may be more of a requirement than you know. Sell what you have, because what you have is yours, you have obtained it, though it has its origin in God,
19:32 -  and it makes up something in which you are spiritually sufficient and even impressive. But if you want the ultimate thing, this is the very thing that you must sell, must void, must give over. Because there's no man good, there's nothing good but God.
19:54 -  Don't you understand the absoluteness of this? What this confrontation means that has been set in scripture is timeless, it's epical in its meaning, it's a collision of an ultimate kind, all the more significant because it's a young ruler,
20:11 -  all the more significant because he's exemplary, because he's got it all together, because he's a really spiritual kind of guy that has obeyed the commandments from youth up, but he's also, of course, rich, because the same character that will obey commandments and is diligent
20:31 -  will also have a material consequence that adds to the substance of the man himself, and Jesus says, sell all that you have. Not some, not to reduce your acquisition so you live more modestly,
20:49 -  but totally void, totally give over all that you have. Get rid of it, because there's nothing good of what you have. Your possessions is equally indicted as you are yourself.
21:08 -  There's no man good. Why callest thou me good? There's no man good but God. When are we going to believe that?
21:18 -  The totality of God's requirement if we are to enjoy his life. And if we don't have his life, we'll have to turn the amplifiers up louder and simulate it and give the appearance of it, and we can do that and make a robust demonstration and enjoy it
21:39 -  and think that by that elation that that constitutes the life. See how dangerous this is? The life, dear saints, I don't have a word to describe.
21:48 -  I'm only hoping and praying, as I do continually before the Lord, that I not only be an expositor of his word, but to demonstrate also its truth. So if what I'm saying does not issue from his life, which is also his wisdom, also his intention,
22:06 -  which if in any moment it should subside or be withdrawn from me, I would crumple before you like the poor piece of dust and earth that I am. I'm wholly dependent on the life of God.
22:22 -  If he withholds it for a moment, I can't speak, I can't gesticulate, I can't move my arms, I can't raise my voice, I have no being independent of that life. And I'm not offering this as some radical alternative that is reserved only for the prophetic man.
22:44 -  The prophetic man like the apostolic man is the demonstration of what is quintessentially God's intention for all the church. For if it is not prophetic and it's not apostolic,
22:56 -  which lives from the life of God, has its enablement out of his power, and wisdom and love and all of the things that are inclusive of that life, what is it? So something needs to sink deep into our hearings
23:12 -  to have a repugnance of the kind that God himself has for what is in man. There's no man good. Why call us me good? I'll not accept your compliment. Only God is good. And only God issues what is good.
23:33 -  Even that which comes forth from the best and well-meaning intentions of man is still something less and other than that which issues from God. And even the disciples were beside themselves.
23:53 -  Well, who then can be saved? Who then can subscribe to this? This is so utter a requirement. And the Lord says, with men it's impossible.
24:04 -  Have you understood the faith to which you have come? The thing to which you have been called? It's an utter contradiction of the world, its wisdom, and its way.
24:15 -  It calls you to be emptied of anything that purports an issues from man that is celebrated as good. Remember early in the Gospel of John, there were some who believed in Jesus when they saw the miracles which he performed,
24:30 -  but he would not commit himself unto them because he knew what was in man that they had come to the right conclusion for the wrong reasons. They had humanly estimated and assessed his miracles
24:42 -  and on that basis had come to a human conclusion that he's the Messiah. Though they came to the right conclusion, they came to it by the wrong means. And he would not yield himself to them even though they were correct in their assessment
24:57 -  because they came to it humanly. But Peter, when Jesus said, Who do men say that I am? And this impulsive fisherman said, Thou art the Christ, the Son, the living God.
25:13 -  Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. You didn't come to this estimation and conclusion because you had the privilege of an intimate association with me
25:27 -  or saw my miracles or heard my teachings. You received something that had to issue from God where there's no way that you can have it. And because you have it from him, you're blessed.
25:38 -  And not only are you blessed, but this is foundational to all the church. On that foundation, will I build my church? That what comes only from God by revelation by the Spirit that issues out of his life,
25:50 -  only that is acceptable, only that is foundational. It's not enough to be correct, even biblically. How many of us are living in any way that can compare with this Jewish young ruler
26:05 -  that our life is as exemplary as his, is as moral as his, is as ethical as his, and is as serious about the commandments of God as he? There's not one of us that would compare.
26:17 -  And yet in God's sight, it's totally a ground for rejection. Follow me, then you have to get rid of all that you have, all your possessions, your riches, your confidence,
26:33 -  which is predicated not on me but yourself and your own attainment as man. With man, it's impossible, but with God. That's the only good thing.
26:53 -  What is in union with himself and issues from himself, and nothing in between and nothing other is good. Believest thou this?
27:05 -  If you believe it, you're as good as dead. You go down on your face, you're destitute. What? Lord, just when I had it all together and thought myself spiritual
27:17 -  and singing the choruses so robustly and with real enjoyment and conviction and living far more impressively than ever I've done before, and now you're telling me, wow, if any aspect of that is the result of my own energy
27:34 -  and intention and human striving, that it's void, and that as much as I enjoy this acquisition of spiritual understanding, if it's humanly obtained by my own cleverness and projected,
27:50 -  I have to get rid of it. I have to be emptied in order to obtain your life and live through that life, to be dead and hid with Christ and God until his life is revealed.
28:06 -  Well, what if he chooses not to reveal it like now? What if a man is called up onto the platform having been given so elaborate an introduction as this, and he stands there at the podium
28:18 -  and nothing happens? He can't draw upon his 75-year history or 40 years in the Lord or even the accomplishments of today that were impressive.
28:33 -  He's totally dependent on the life of God that will be revealed if God chooses, but he'll test us. He'll not always be at our elbow for our convenience
28:48 -  to save us from embarrassment or failure or humiliation. There will be occasions if we cast ourselves in such utter dependency upon him when he'll choose to keep it unrevealed and withheld
29:01 -  and allow our faces to stick out embarrassingly and we have not a clever word to say or a spiritual foot to put forward. Are you willing for that humiliation?
29:11 -  To be so tested? To be hid with God and Christ until his life is revealed? Because when it's revealed, it's no longer the issue of a successful evening
29:25 -  or an enjoyable message. His glory follows. I think the Lord is wanting to ruin you tonight.
29:36 -  And I don't feel guilty because you're so charismatically impressive. But I tell you what, that there's a note of sorrow in my heart tonight that I just learned en route to this meeting
29:51 -  that one of the most celebrated so-called oracles of the hour, internationally known, has been found to be in a condition of alcoholism and homosexuality. And I'm sorrowing not only for the man's fall
30:09 -  but suspecting that it's the beginning of the unraveling of a garment that is long overdue. It's the emperor's garment.
30:19 -  You know that story where only the child was able to see that the emperor is naked and everybody else was oohing and awing at how impressive the supposed garment is? It's a false garment. It's a superficial garment.
30:31 -  It's a religiously contrived something that we have celebrated too mindlessly and enjoyed. And the Lord is pulling and unraveling the thing from the bottom. And who knows where it will end when this most conspicuous figure,
30:47 -  celebrated as the oracle of the hour, God's present prophet, is found to be in a state of moral fallenness of the most shameful kind. Well, where were those who were close to him?
31:00 -  Where were those who should have observed the earliest signs of a tendency and propensity toward a movement away from righteousness that should have been corrected in the moment?
31:11 -  What is it that was working that made this figure so compelling and attractive and full of hype? I've sat in rooms, I've gone out of my way to hear the man.
31:24 -  If indeed he could be the oracle of the hour, I was willing to take second place. But alack and alas, every time I extended myself, it was with disappointment. And yet I watched this figure on the platform being introduced
31:38 -  much more glowingly than what was spoken of me tonight. And the man didn't even stir or bat an eyelash, and I was waiting for him to come to the microphone and say,
31:51 -  I appreciate, brother, your good intention, but I have to say, I'm not what you're describing. I'm just a servant who has the gift of prophecy,
32:01 -  and I can give personal prophecy, but I'm not an oracular figure who's bringing ultimate statements of the kind that are out from the heart of God for this moment
32:12 -  that touch time and eternity and interpret prophetic scripture in the light of present events and things that are future that consummate in the conclusion of the age.
32:22 -  I'm not that kind of prophet. Don't introduce me as the oracle of the hour and the prophet. I'm not that.
32:31 -  But alack and alas, the man never stirred and allowed this heavy acknowledgement to go forth as if it's true. Unlike Jesus, he didn't stop this acknowledgement.
32:45 -  Jesus would not for a moment allow this young man to go on and acknowledge him as good master. Was not Jesus a good master?
32:53 -  My God, he was better than a good master. But he would not receive that compliment in the spirit and mentality from which it issued for to acknowledge and to receive that
33:04 -  is already giving the game away. He would not allow himself to be considered as a man who is good because there's no man good but God.
33:17 -  What must I do? This young ruler shows where his mind is. What must I accomplish?
33:25 -  What must I perform? What can issue from me that can attain eternal life? He doesn't know what it means to sell all that you have, to relinquish,
33:39 -  to let go, abdicate, cease from yourself, surrender, renounce yourself. Abandon ourselves to the Lord. Not the things that we want to be rid of, our bad habits,
33:49 -  our temper, our unkind disposition, our carnality. No, the possessions that make you rich, your accomplishment, your spiritual attainment, your efficiency, your impressiveness,
34:03 -  your worship leader ability, your preaching, your gift of gab, your aura of authority, the kinds of things that have elevated you to a place of prominence.
34:14 -  That's what God is after. Who doesn't want to get rid of the things that we want to dump? It's the possessions that are rich,
34:22 -  that are the things that must be voided and given over if we're to have life. Go thy way.
34:32 -  Sell whatsoever you have. Go thy way. Sell whatsoever you have.
34:39 -  Talent, ambition, spiritual attainment. The remarkable thing is you probably even have it from God, but you have it.
34:49 -  It's yours, your possession, and your confidence and trust is not so much in him who gave it, but your obtainment of it and your manipulation and use through it.
35:01 -  That's why it's got to be given up, given back. I said this morning, there are too many young squirts recently saved that are on the platform with their guitars.
35:11 -  Where and what is their qualification to lead in worship who hardly know the Lord, but are competent in their musicality? I've watched them chew gum and crack gum and smirk and smile
35:23 -  and flirt with the girls even while they're strumming, and the poor minister who has given them this opportunity is being diminished before their sight
35:32 -  because they are where the action is. They're influencing the atmosphere and bringing attention to themselves
35:40 -  in the supposed name of the Lord who's the object of worship, so-called. Phony baloney, dear saints.
35:48 -  Corruptive, defiling. We need to relinquish and take that guitar from that young man and not give it back to him until he demonstrates a sanctified life
36:03 -  through observed discipline and dealings of God where he really comes to know the holiness of the Most High and can worship him in spirit and truth.
36:13 -  Until then, he needs to abdicate and forfeit his musical ability and talent. And whatever is the comparable thing that we have as possession
36:23 -  needs to be, go and sell what you have. Go and give it up. Go and relinquish and forfeit it.
36:31 -  Because there's one thing that you lack. And to lack that one thing is to lack everything. I don't know how to say it.
36:38 -  If you lack that, no matter how impressive are the other things that are important? The other things that are a part of your life,
36:52 -  Christian personality and service, to lack that is to lack all. This one thing.
36:59 -  You lack this? And it has to be so precious in your sight to attend to this one thing that is lacked
37:07 -  that you're willing to forfeit your ambition, your attainment, your preaching style to whatsoever, that you'll have treasure in heaven
37:15 -  and you'll have treasure from heaven that exceeds the best that we can know and waits upon the totality of this renunciation.
37:28 -  Put that into your Singaporean pipe and smoke it. Did you hear that? You who got A's in English?
37:39 -  The best we have needs to be renounced. And God waits on the totality of renunciation if we are to receive the gift
37:49 -  and the privilege of eternal life, which is the life that Jesus said, I've come to bring you life in that more abundantly.
37:58 -  There's no distinction between that life and the life that's eternal. The privilege is that we don't have to wait to die
38:04 -  to have that eternal life. We can have it now, not as an enjoyment or as a new possession,
38:10 -  but as the source of our being, our reason for being, our ability to be and to serve, which at any moment, if it pleases him to test us,
38:20 -  he can withheld. Because we're dead in our humanity, in our confidence, in what we can employ,
38:30 -  and are hid with God in Christ until his life is revealed. And when it's revealed, it may not come out in the way that you would appreciate.
38:37 -  It may come out in a way that will embarrass you, make you an object of reproach, have you to speak foolishly,
38:44 -  and carry on in such a way as to make people frown and look strangely at you who thought that somehow you were Godly
38:52 -  and a servant of the Most High. But how do you begin like that? As we had occasion just days ago in Germany
39:00 -  to begin three days of meetings with German students who found us on a website and wrote to us and said, you seem to be the real thing.
39:08 -  They needed the real thing. They were desperately urgent for the real thing. They weren't looking for some accomplished,
39:16 -  charismatic personality who can give them cliches of a kind that they've already heard that a stone cold dead.
39:23 -  And so we came. I arrived in the back of a car, half the size of what you drive.
39:30 -  It was a little, I don't know what it was, but it was little. And I was so contorted.
39:36 -  I couldn't find a place. We had like a three-hour drive from Holland to Germany, and I was crumpled in that back.
39:43 -  My neck was stiff, couldn't doze off, and I desperately needed sleep. Why?
39:48 -  Because you're up three in the morning, four in the morning, five in the morning. Doesn't the Lord know you need your rest?
39:54 -  Why does he bring you out of your bed for these insane devotional times that could just as easily have been obtained
40:02 -  at seven a.m. and eight at a reasonable hour? Why three, four when the Lord knows that you've got commitment that day,
40:09 -  and you need to be at your best and strongest instead of arriving crumpled and exhausted and spent? And looking out on a sea of German faces
40:21 -  who are looking you over and wondering what they're going to get who had hoped that somehow you would be the real thing.
40:30 -  I looked out on them. I sat in the, just like tonight, listening to their choruses,
40:36 -  which were almost as good as yours, and the strange thing was, I couldn't enter their celebration.
40:45 -  In fact, the more they sang, the more I mourned. I was sorrowing. I had to touch my eyes with my handkerchief.
40:53 -  Tears were welling up in my eyes. I thought, well, why am I feeling like this? Shouldn't I enter this celebration
40:59 -  with these genuine, sincere saints? And when I got up, I was in the strangest mood, and I opened my mouth and I said,
41:09 -  you lack a tragic sense of life. Pow! Do you think I knew what I was talking about?
41:18 -  Not a bit. All I knew was this, that that statement had to be made.
41:25 -  Something needed to be sounded, not just as a device to arrest their attention, but to pierce them in their inward deeps,
41:33 -  because I was conscious, maybe especially as a Jewish man, that hardly a generation after the Holocaust
41:40 -  that had taken six million Jewish lives and a million and a half children, this generation of university students
41:47 -  is completely untouched and unaffected by that recent tragedy and have not a visible, evident, tragic sense of life.
41:57 -  That doesn't let you off the hook being Asian, and that if you're not German, you're not under obligation to have a tragic sense.
42:06 -  If you don't have a tragic sense of life, you're a shallow piece of goods. History has passed you by.
42:14 -  You're living in the present now. You have the narrowest focus. There's every reason to have a tragic sense of life,
42:24 -  whether your history confirms it or not. German history is your history, because it's man.
42:32 -  It's what man has done, man and his failure, and not just ordinary man,
42:38 -  but German man, far more exemplary than Asian man, if you'll allow me that Western bias.
42:47 -  You may cut me off from Chinese food hereafter. The worst of fate for Jews. German is the epitome of civilization,
43:02 -  of man's accomplishment. Call the theologians, the philosophers, who's the one, the ethical, the imperative,
43:15 -  Kant, K-A-M-T, and Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Wagner, Beethoven, Mozart,
43:23 -  Heinrich Heine, poets, philosophers, theologians. It's the genius of civilization,
43:31 -  and they were reduced to something bestial and became a machine for the systematic annihilation of the chosen people.
43:40 -  Hey, saints, that's tragic. Something is rotten in Denmark. Something is amiss.
43:47 -  There's something wrong in the very foundation of life and reality, and how can you be a student
43:53 -  in this factory of a university with concrete walls, and it's not the older universities
44:02 -  that with ivy covered Heidelbergs. This is a new university cast in concrete.
44:09 -  Something like this decor and impersonal, and these are the students there
44:16 -  to attain degrees so that they can become professionals and make a living and have an impressive kind and have their own BMWs.
44:24 -  No tragic sense of life. And you know what? I did not know what the next sentence should be.
44:31 -  My dear brother who was with me thought, it's finished. It's over before it begins.
44:38 -  I've seen Ott get himself into predicaments, but this is one from which he cannot extricate himself. This is absurd to begin that way,
44:46 -  but you want to know something? Three days later at the final meeting, the Lord had moved us from a moment of utter senselessness
44:57 -  that defies rationality and expectation unto glory. He made a deposit in Germany that will touch that nation,
45:06 -  that will touch the church of that nation, that will have consequence of a kind that can't even be estimated,
45:12 -  because he began in an utterly and absurd and foolish and unpredictable way by a man who lives from that life and has to yield to that life
45:20 -  even when it brings forth something that he himself doesn't understand and to which he would not even agree
45:26 -  and offends his own taste and sensibility. That's what it means to live by the life of God. Are you willing, you Asians,
45:36 -  who I understand have a culture that has to do with keeping face and being esteemed and recognized as spiritual,
45:47 -  are you willing to be that absurd, that cast upon God, that foolish, that crumpled, that weak,
45:56 -  to come out of a car where you can hardly straighten up and fogged over by lack of sleep and exhaustion, having gone through severe demand already in Holland
46:06 -  before you arrived in Germany, and open your mouth and let the Lord, whose wisdom is in his life, give expression
46:14 -  as a beginning for which you don't even know how to continue, let alone where it will end, because he's the Alpha and the Omega of every occasion,
46:23 -  not just the beginning of creation, but every day in our Christian life, he's Alpha and Omega.
46:29 -  He's got to begin, because only he knows the end from the beginning, but can he begin through you? If you have your own sense of propriety and rightness
46:39 -  in what is spiritually acceptable, and are not wanting to be cast on that dependency, because after all, you've got something of yourself
46:47 -  and your own and you're intelligent and you're able and you're spiritual, sell all that you have.
46:56 -  Forfeit, relinquish, give it over, not the cheap things, the best things, the things that you most want to cling to
47:05 -  and possess for its man. You can't do it. Therefore, we don't enter into the Kingdom
47:18 -  that heavily dimensioned reality and authority, though we prattle about it profusely, because we trust in our own riches
47:25 -  and make them our confidence and our dependence. Boy, Katz, where did you get that statement? Right out from the life of God.
47:35 -  Not my cleverness. What is he saying? We prattle about the Kingdom of God.
47:41 -  We're fluent, dexterous in our vocabulary, and we're so naive as to think that because we can mouth these terms,
47:50 -  that we have some measure of its reality. We don't even know what the Kingdom is. We have no sense of its theocratic reality
48:00 -  and rule and that it's Davidic and must take place from the holy hill of Zion through a restored Israel and out of there,
48:08 -  Jerusalem must go forth to the Lord and the word of the Lord. But we talk about the Kingdom
48:13 -  and we think that by invoking that kind of term, it brings a little bit more of a luster and dimension of seriousness
48:20 -  to what otherwise would be merely charismatic. We prattle, we speak, but we have not the awesome sense,
48:28 -  the reality of the requirement and the significance of that Kingdom even now. Because with man, it's impossible.
48:40 -  But not with God. When will we believe him that without me, you can do nothing?
48:47 -  How would you like to predicate everything in this trust and confidence that if he be not God, if there be no resurrection,
48:56 -  you of all people are most to be pitied. And if you will not supply what is needed in the moment, which is not just the issue of your reputation,
49:08 -  but a life and death moment. In fact, aren't all your moments life and death moments? Or you don't see that way?
49:16 -  You just thought you go to school or you're at an office or you're learning in college and university
49:22 -  and one day is like another? And so if you meet someone and talk to someone, it's interesting, but no big deal.
49:28 -  You see, you're living beneath the intention of God. You don't understand the eternality of even accidental contact
49:38 -  of a word that can come in season that could set something in motion that will affect a man's salvation in his eternity
49:44 -  and it has got to come from you and not out of your cleverness because you can quote John 3.16,
49:50 -  are you saved, brother? He needs to hear something else. What he needs to hear has got to come to him
49:56 -  from the throne of heaven and the wisdom of God who knows that man intimately and you cannot know,
50:02 -  but are you yielded to the life that can give you a word for that one because eternity is at stake
50:09 -  and who is sufficient for these things? You do err because you do not appraise life
50:19 -  apostolically and prophetically because your one day is like another, because your Christianity is a succession of services
50:28 -  which are enjoyable, but you do not live in the intensity and appreciation of what life means
50:37 -  and why we're here and what can be touched by us even in seeming accident
50:43 -  by a God who is utterly sovereign and knows the end from the beginning and has given us works to walk in
50:49 -  before the foundations of the earth were laid. Which work is taking place tonight? Believe us now this
50:57 -  or is this just a novelty? A Jewish guy that happens to be in town and let's have him because
51:03 -  he has some kind of prophetic reputation. It'll be enjoyable. One of us is devastatingly in error.
51:15 -  I look upon tonight as a once and for all occasion that will not ever be given again
51:23 -  and that we dare not miss it. And merely to bring something good is not good enough.
51:29 -  It's not enough to be biblical and doctrinally correct or amusing or to be a novelty.
51:35 -  There are issues at stake of such moment, of such consequence that we dare not miss God in any moment.
51:44 -  Life is to be heightened in our appreciation for its significance and its meaning.
51:51 -  And how are we to meet these requirements? Even as young believers? Aren't you in school with nonbelievers?
51:58 -  And don't you have teachers that are utterly secular who need to hear from you and see in you
52:04 -  some measure of divinity that makes their heads to turn and makes them to rub their chin
52:10 -  and wonder, what about this student? There's something about her or him and the essay and the assignment
52:16 -  that I'm reading is more than just a kid fulfilling a requirement. There's something here that has a resonance
52:22 -  that comes from another place beyond the earth. Only the life of God
52:30 -  can provide that kind of reality, dear saints. And that reality is reality. And anything less or other is unreality.
52:40 -  And God is beginning to judge it and pull out and unravel it and unmask it and show it forth as naked
52:50 -  before the whole charismatic world that has celebrated and luxuriated in that unreality.
52:56 -  And I praise God for it. Tragic that it would require a man's humiliation
53:05 -  in such deplorable sin. But if that's what it takes to be waken from our sleep and to agree
53:11 -  with God that there's no man good and without me you can do nothing and that we need to sell all that we have
53:19 -  and we're to receive the life by which we're called to live and to give expression in our time and age,
53:26 -  then it's not extravagant for him to require that man's humiliation if it'll save us from living beneath his glory
53:37 -  in predictable Christianity adorned with charismatic flourishes that fall short of the glory of God.
53:53 -  Without me you can do nothing. He yearns for the infusion of his life for us that comes with union with himself.
54:01 -  For the believer can each day be pleasing to God only in that which he does through the power of Christ dwelling in him.
54:09 -  The daily inflowing of the life sap of the Holy Spirit is his only power to bring forth
54:16 -  enduring an eternal fruit. This is from Andrew Murray in his book Abide in Christ.
54:24 -  And you know where Andrew got it? From God. Where did he make this profound observation
54:31 -  that came to him through the life of God to which he submits and yields and which is his life?
54:37 -  When Paul says for me to live as Christ you think he's just coining a little phrase? You think he's playing on words
54:44 -  that this is a piece of rhetoric? That's cute? Or is Paul giving us the definitive principle
54:51 -  by which this man lives this remarkable apostolic lifestyle and makes himself an object
54:58 -  for the attack and persecution and oppression of his own Jewish kinsmen and the powers of darkness
55:04 -  that hate this man's guts and have seen that men will vow and throw dust up in the air and on their heads
55:10 -  that they'll not eat or drink until he's dead because the man is not fit to live. How come you're getting by with much less?
55:18 -  How come you're not an object of oppression and persecution? How is it that you're one of the nice guys
55:24 -  who's both Christian and nice and good fun? Because you're not in Paul's place.
55:32 -  You're not in that apostolic realm. You're not in that intensity of life. You're not living from the life of God
55:39 -  which the world hates. And the powers of darkness want to be able to say Jesus we know, Paul we know, but who are you?
55:47 -  There's nothing about you however well-meaning your intentions, however well you worship,
55:52 -  however much your programs. That makes us in any way to take note of you let alone to fear what you're about
55:58 -  because it only issues from your unaided humanity with a little flourish charismatically from the Lord
56:06 -  but it's essentially you. And it's only him that terrifies us. His life terrifies us
56:13 -  because his life is omnipotent, omniscient, it's powerful, it's rich, it's totally antithetical to the death that we represent.
56:25 -  There's a contest between life and death not in the narrow biological terms but in the largest cosmic,
56:34 -  spiritual and philosophical understanding that there's a contest between two alternatives, life and death.
56:41 -  And the world lies in the wicked one, the evil one, the father of lies who's the author of death
56:47 -  celebrates death and has a whole religious movement called Islam
56:52 -  that loves to take the heads off of shoulders of men who are Western, American, and especially Jewish.
56:58 -  What a trophy they'll have in me because I'm all free. That kind of evil
57:09 -  that loves death because it hates God. And when you read the Psalms, what do you read in the psalmist?
57:14 -  They're after my life, my persecutors, they harass me, they don't let me go,
57:21 -  I'm continually an object of their derision, they bring me to shame, they're wicked, they're evil, they're malevolent,
57:27 -  they're after my life. Not just my physical existence but the principle by which I live
57:34 -  which is God and they hate God in me for he is my life
57:38 -  and they want to destroy that by destroying me. How many of us tonight can say we need to live as Christ?
57:47 -  More than that, how many of us are willing to be brought to a place where we can say that
57:51 -  and desire that? Because we know that without that life who is sufficient?
57:57 -  There's a world dying outside this door in their BMWs and sleek cars and Mercedes and you name it.
58:05 -  They're dying in their era. They have no sense of what lies beyond this. They don't even know
58:10 -  that there's an eternal life. That if they don't obtain it now, they'll not obtain it ever.
58:16 -  Who's to tell them? Who's to break into that unreality that is so pervasive
58:20 -  and so accepted that people think it normative and that you're the queer ones?
58:29 -  We have a task, burden, an obligation for our generation and our time for all Asia.
58:37 -  This cat has boasted that Singapore will be the Antioch to Asia. That out of the Singapore
58:44 -  will come apostolic men sent from apostolic bodies whose word is more than just
58:50 -  an interesting or inspirational thing but is an event. It comes in the power of God.
58:57 -  But where is that sending body if it's resting on its haunches and is content with what it can perform in itself
59:04 -  out of its well-meaning intentions and its own humanity and is not cast upon God for all of life?
59:12 -  That if there's no resurrection, we of all men are most to be pitied and prefer to have it so
59:19 -  and make that the condition of our life and being, casting all upon God. Andrew Murray, the same spirit
59:33 -  that dwelled and still dwells in the sun becomes the life of the believer in the unity of that one spirit
59:41 -  and fellowship of the same life that is in Christ. Praise the Lord that the Italians invented the phrase, Mamma Mia!
59:52 -  What a statement! I'll tell you what, that statement eclipses human brilliance
01:00:00 -  and spirituality. The statement itself is divine in its wisdom and in its origin
01:00:07 -  and it issued out of an earthen vessel called Andrew Murray who knew and spoke this reality
01:00:14 -  because he lived through it and lived by it. What was available to him and to Paul
01:00:21 -  is available to us. Well, why don't we have it, brother? Because you have not sold all that you possess.
01:00:28 -  You have not given up and relinquished your treasure and your riches, your singing and cleaving,
01:00:35 -  and want all this and heaven too. And even want to succeed on the basis of what you have as man.
01:00:45 -  And you can, charismatically, but not apostolically, not prophetically, not gloriously.
01:00:56 -  The unity, the same spirit that dwelled and still dwells in the sun,
01:01:02 -  we are dead and hid with Christ in God, becomes the life of the believer in the unity of that one spirit
01:01:11 -  and fellowship of the same life. Are you having fellowship with the life? Don't think that it's obtained
01:01:18 -  in your choruses. The fellowship with the life has got to be while it's yet dark
01:01:24 -  and day has not yet broken. And you're up at four or five a.m. and on your knees or on your face
01:01:31 -  in your prayer cabinet and in a private and quiet unseen place with God.
01:01:38 -  There is the test of your affection and your devotion, not what you can sing impressively
01:01:46 -  in the corporate environment. The early morning hour where you're foolish and weak,
01:01:53 -  where your body cries out to stay in bed and you get out in foolish devotion and seek the Holy One of Israel
01:02:00 -  and bow before Him for the piece of dust that you are, acknowledging that you don't know
01:02:05 -  how to put one foot before the other to walk out this day that has come, which is once and for all
01:02:10 -  and will not ever be given again, where issues of an eternal kind are ever before you
01:02:16 -  that require a wisdom beyond your own and an ability beyond your own. And you prostrate before Him
01:02:22 -  and in communion, not only to the acknowledgement of who He is, but in the receiving in that communion
01:02:28 -  something from His life. And you're foolish enough like me to take communion daily.
01:02:34 -  You've got to have the bread and the wine. It's not enough to wait once a month for how often you have it.
01:02:40 -  You crave to eat and drink of the Lord. You need the substance of that bread of life
01:02:46 -  that has come down from heaven. You need the wine, which is the essence of His Spirit,
01:02:52 -  to fuel you in your inner man for the day that's before you, and not attend in any serious way
01:02:58 -  except in that power. That's what He's talking about in the fellowship with God,
01:03:04 -  in the place of communion before day begins and the house is asleep,
01:03:10 -  you're foolishly out of bed and before the Lord, and you're not going to give up
01:03:16 -  because you don't feel anything. There's no sense of His presence. So this must be a foolish
01:03:22 -  and wasteful investment. And if I don't have the sense of God's presence, what's the point?
01:03:28 -  Because you're in it to get something, you utilitarian Asian saints. I know you only too well.
01:03:38 -  So much invested for so much obtained. The spirit of utility that prevails in the world
01:03:44 -  governs your spirituality. You're willing to extend for a service if there's a benefit.
01:03:50 -  But communion with God doesn't dangle a carrot before your nose
01:03:58 -  and offer you benefit that's worth your investment. It's because He is who He is.
01:04:04 -  Because He's the living God, because He's the Creator, because He's full of grace,
01:04:10 -  because He has provided an atonement that has saved us out of death and hell that we could not have earned
01:04:16 -  or obtained by any merit or any act that we could perform. He needs daily to be honored
01:04:22 -  and to be acknowledged and to confess that without you I can do nothing. Lord, how am I going to speak
01:04:28 -  to these Singaporeans tonight at this cornerstone church beyond being a mere novelty
01:04:36 -  and a piece of amusement? How are you going to say something Lord that's going to go into the very
01:04:42 -  deeps of that fellowship, that congregation, and require a total reassessment of what we are about
01:04:48 -  and where are we going and by what means and how we need to factor in this word
01:04:54 -  that has come for it strikes at the heart of our being. That's what we have to
01:05:00 -  seek the Lord before the day even begins and trust that when that hour comes
01:05:06 -  and you're awake in the half hour before the meeting having a nap that is so desperately needed
01:05:12 -  and brought there looking all dressed and ready to go that you yourself know you're a crumpled piece of merchandise
01:05:18 -  and in you is no good thing if the life of God is not going to be active. That there's something more at stake
01:05:26 -  than the man's reputation is the once and for all moment that will not be given again
01:05:32 -  that only his life is sufficient to answer not only by its energy but by its wisdom, by its content
01:05:38 -  by his will to live through him and for him unto him to whom be glory forever
01:05:44 -  is the definitive and normative intention of God for all saints. But it requires fellowship
01:05:54 -  with the life, unity with that one spirit that is in Christ and if there's anything of any kind
01:06:00 -  that is contrary to his holiness that fellowship is severed, he withdraws, he recoils
01:06:08 -  that means there's an imperative to walk in such a way that's God honoring to watch our mouths
01:06:14 -  to watch our prattle, to watch our casual speech to watch the disposition of our hearts that even if we hear
01:06:20 -  that a man of God has fallen whom we could never even earlier
01:06:26 -  acknowledge to be the oracle of the hour that we should not secretly and maliciously enjoy
01:06:32 -  his fall. Can you understand that? The human heart, the deceitfulness
01:06:38 -  of the heart that needs to be guarded against lest we lapse into something contrary
01:06:44 -  to the holiness of God that would injure the fellowship that is so urgent by which we derive his life.
01:06:50 -  It takes a constant vigilance and a diligence which we cannot even accomplish
01:06:56 -  by ourselves independently of others with whom we're joined as brothers in fellowship who will be
01:07:02 -  quick to tell us if they see some disposition in us that is contrary to God in his holiness and his way.
01:07:08 -  So that means we need to be in a kind of relationship in which we can be observed in which even the subtlety of differences
01:07:14 -  will be quick to be detected and known and that we love one another even having observed that difference to speak
01:07:20 -  it in love. But you run the risk of being successful.
01:07:26 -  There are too many of you for the kind of intimacy that this reality requires.
01:07:32 -  So you have to find some way in the midst of your success and numbers
01:07:38 -  to have that face-to-face kind of relationship in a frequency in which when there's any
01:07:44 -  deviation in character and life it's quick to be seen and acknowledged and communicated.
01:07:50 -  For we're in something together of an ultimate kind that is more
01:07:56 -  than happy services that requires time and diligence and relationship
01:08:02 -  that is authentic. For if we will not have it with each other to what degree will we have it with God?
01:08:10 -  And I'll tell you what, church that is as earnest as that cannot be performed on the basis
01:08:16 -  of human well-meaning intention and natural energy. It requires itself
01:08:22 -  the life of God. For truth's ultimate demand against the flesh
01:08:28 -  requires a kind of gospel heroism and courage and a love for truth and reality
01:08:34 -  that is God. And so there's a rest that remains to the
01:08:44 -  people of God which is the ultimate hallmark of biblical faith to which few have come.
01:08:50 -  This is that spoken by Jesus if any man come to me and hate not his father, mother, wife, children, brethren, sisters, yea
01:08:56 -  and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. You've got to hate your own life also.
01:09:02 -  You've got not to trust it. You've got to despise its subtlety that wants to run the show.
01:09:08 -  Wants to operate through your intellect or your singing ability or whatever proficiency
01:09:14 -  that you have and have a place of dominance above that of the spirit of God
01:09:20 -  in your spirit. You've got to hate that intellect and put it in its
01:09:26 -  proper place, subservient to the spirit of God in your spirit as a servant and as an employment
01:09:32 -  and not as something that runs the show. And you preachers must sell all that you have. This is really a message for preachers
01:09:40 -  the rest of you can listen in. You preachers must sell all that you have
01:09:46 -  your impressive soulish verve. Did you learn that in English 1A?
01:09:52 -  V-E-R-V-E that stylistic kind of flourish that we charismatic
01:09:58 -  ministers are especially adept to perform and which the people love. We know how to raise our
01:10:04 -  voices, we know how to manipulate, we know how to touch the heartstrings. This is our baggage.
01:10:10 -  This is our technique our methodology our picturesque affectation
01:10:16 -  our style, our calculated stylisms that comprise our riches.
01:10:22 -  And if we are to follow him in the same totality by which he followed the father
01:10:28 -  taking up the cross we have to forfeit those things as riches that we
01:10:34 -  cannot enjoy let alone think to serve God by. That means we're stripped.
01:10:40 -  That means unless the Lord gives a flourish, unless the Lord gives a holy ghost verve, we
01:10:46 -  ourselves will not draw from our own ability to be entertaining or compelling or anything like that.
01:10:52 -  If the word of God itself will not command the attention of God's people then we're dead ducks
01:10:58 -  and he doesn't need our help to liven it up by some kind of dimension we're going to bring
01:11:04 -  that's personable that issues out of our energy and out of our life. The word alone
01:11:10 -  which is his and comes out of the wisdom of his life in the moment of his choosing will serve its own ends
01:11:16 -  and perform its own purposes. We ministers don't
01:11:24 -  I had to caution men at our recent conference don't beat the rock just speak to it
01:11:30 -  the waters will gush out the waters of life it doesn't need your assistance your additional
01:11:36 -  personality and ability and charismatic style in order to bring it
01:11:42 -  forth. Be the simple unadorned saint be what you are that you are by the grace
01:11:48 -  of God come crumpled from the back of a car come without rest come in whatsoever
01:11:54 -  condition because your weakness his strength is made perfect. Be willing to be weak be willing to be foolish
01:12:02 -  don't put your confidence in your own capability and that you're
01:12:08 -  flushed with strength and know how. You make yourself weak you make yourself poor you choose
01:12:18 -  apostolic poverty merely because you have are able to enjoy a BMW
01:12:24 -  doesn't mean that you're driving one. You avoid the kinds of things which you are able to possess
01:12:30 -  because you know their subtlety and you know the inroads and the elevation that comes in the enjoyment
01:12:36 -  of a luxurious vehicle and the various other kinds of things that make up the life that are contrary
01:12:42 -  to the apostolic character of the true faith of men who lived in apostolic
01:12:48 -  poverty. There's a reason why the great prophet wore a camel's hair
01:12:56 -  skin and ate locust and honey and was out from the establishment in the wilderness place.
01:13:02 -  He could not have been for the people nor forgot what he must if he mingled with and drew from
01:13:08 -  and was part of the status quo and the things that are not in themselves necessarily sinful
01:13:14 -  but the enjoyment of them does bring a certain erosion
01:13:20 -  of reality and truth and therefore it's not masochistic
01:13:26 -  this is not some psyching yourself out to voluntarily make yourself poor.
01:13:32 -  You don't have to live to the limit of your income. You can live beneath it and modestly
01:13:38 -  if it will ensure a greater casting upon the Lord for dependency
01:13:44 -  for life, for wisdom, for speaking, for utterance. Got the idea?
01:13:52 -  And so Andrew Murray says meditate on this until your soul
01:13:58 -  bows to worship in the presence of this mystery. You have to meditate on this
01:14:04 -  awkward on the spot interpolation putting something together from a newsletter
01:14:10 -  article that is being presented tonight that probably is more significant than I myself know.
01:14:16 -  You need to meditate upon it. This is a word for successful church. This is word
01:14:22 -  for an abounding Christianity in an affluent Singapore
01:14:28 -  that strikes at the very unspoken premise and wisdom by which the whole society lives its life
01:14:34 -  including the Christian segment of it. We need to meditate
01:14:40 -  and bow and worship what God is saying. The very act of bowing
01:14:46 -  breaks the soulish powers that have had too long sway. You should have been with us this morning. Get the tapes
01:14:52 -  where we talked about the difference between soul and spirit. That the church is
01:14:58 -  in its condition is so abysmal it can't even discern the difference between soul and spirit. It has been
01:15:04 -  so long taken up in the realm of soulishness that it thinks that to be spirit
01:15:10 -  it has not guarded its treasure, its inward integrity and is
01:15:16 -  so open to be manipulated and moved by anything of a kind that excites emotion.
01:15:22 -  There's a purity the jealousy for that inward thing that has come
01:15:28 -  from God that we dare not allow to be assaulted or penetrated because it appears
01:15:34 -  to be, because it seems to celebrate God, because there's a difference between
01:15:40 -  soul and spirit. Not only must we recognize that difference but ruthlessly cleave to the one as
01:15:46 -  against the other. We're called to be sons and daughters of the resurrection. We're a people of the spirit
01:15:52 -  which is his life. But you've got to sell all that you have in order to obtain it
01:16:00 -  and to live continuously by it. So I want to pray
01:16:10 -  in conclusion that you will pray rich young ruler that you are
01:16:16 -  you came running in all kinds of excitement and enthusiasm ready to acknowledge
01:16:22 -  and say the appropriate thing out of your own religiosity out of your own natural enthusiasm
01:16:28 -  wanting something because you think you deserve it or can obtain it or earn it or merit it.
01:16:34 -  Not realizing in man is no good thing at all. Without me you can do
01:16:40 -  nothing nothing of eternal significance that is, though you can perform
01:16:46 -  services admirably. Let's pray. Lord
01:16:54 -  You're ruthless tonight. Even
01:17:00 -  you're close to being disrespectful and you're being very direct
01:17:08 -  my God. If I'm not mistaken if this is not just me
01:17:14 -  if this is not just some petulant Jewish character who has his little bias against Charizmatica
01:17:20 -  but this is your heart and out of your life that's being expressed and is sounding a call
01:17:26 -  of a kind that is so demanding so total that asks us to
01:17:32 -  forfeit anything that has its origin and issuance and perpetuation
01:17:38 -  in our humanity even in our well-meaning humanity as being the very obstruction
01:17:44 -  to the receiving and living by the life which is the life the eternal life of God.
01:17:50 -  So my God look over this people look at the rich young rulers
01:17:56 -  who have obeyed the commandments done all the right things come my God
01:18:02 -  and let them hear your call sell whatsoever you have forfeit
01:18:08 -  anything in which you have a confidence and by which you're finding a measure of success
01:18:14 -  through your ability. Give it up be willing to lose your voice and become
01:18:20 -  a horse and unable to sing a word in note and in tune unless
01:18:26 -  the life of God gives you that grace. You can't preach, you can't teach you can't oversee a congregation
01:18:34 -  accept you receive the ability, the enablement the wisdom, the care, the love
01:18:40 -  of the life that flows from God. Empty yourself
01:18:46 -  forfeit, relinquish, give up the very thing that Singaporean society
01:18:52 -  has encouraged you to obtain by your wit by your skill
01:18:58 -  by the exercise of yourself would be the basis for success not only in the world but in the kingdom
01:19:04 -  and God is asking a total refutation of that wisdom which is not
01:19:10 -  of God but of the worlds which no one has called into question even in the congregation
01:19:16 -  and has allowed us to succeed on that same basis. Come my God
01:19:22 -  show us how jealous you are for yourself that you'll not share your glory with any
01:19:28 -  flesh, that there's nothing that we can perform or do that is admirable and deserves any acknowledgement
01:19:34 -  to conserve your ultimate purpose, that only that which is of you
01:19:40 -  and through you and for you has to do with the eternal praise of your glory.
01:19:46 -  So come my God and collect what these saints are now willing to forfeit and give up
01:19:52 -  their treasure their riches their confidence
01:19:58 -  what a requirement my God to make of Singaporean saints. How cruel
01:20:04 -  of you to make that demand and make it so ultimate and so total that unless
01:20:10 -  it's done in totality your life is not available you'll not let it mingle
01:20:16 -  with some mixed bag thing that is retained in ourselves we have to forfeit the one entirely
01:20:22 -  in order to obtain the other. You're asking a death lord you're bringing before us the cross
01:20:32 -  and give grace now especially to the young ones because they want to succeed on the basis
01:20:38 -  of their life they've had hardly a chance to to sow their oats and to show themselves capable and you're asking
01:20:44 -  that before they even get started to forfeit that kind of quest and give it over
01:20:50 -  and even from the beginning to trust you for life and for everything and these ministers
01:20:58 -  my God who have helped you along with their
01:21:04 -  flourishes and other devices to give up those riches my God that have been so successful
01:21:12 -  and are not in themselves necessarily sinful but they're our riches
01:21:18 -  they're our treasures, they're our possessions they're man's
01:21:24 -  come saints talk to God sell all that you have in your heart
01:21:30 -  let it go that if you find yourself with a voice tomorrow
01:21:36 -  it's the grace of God and not some natural attribute that you possess as your own
01:21:42 -  let's get serious the stakes are eternal the world is
01:21:48 -  dying in its success it knows nothing about eternity
01:21:54 -  because it has not been commended to them by those who are living in that eternal life
01:22:00 -  now so do we bless you Lord
01:22:06 -  break our hearts my God transact with us we can forfeit even tonight
01:22:14 -  those things that for which you have waited that you might be all
01:22:20 -  in all that you might have a Christian community composed entirely
01:22:26 -  of Christ's fools who cannot put one foot before the other
01:22:32 -  without walking into walls however accomplished they are by virtue
01:22:38 -  of what society has taught them to do and to be they're utterly cast upon you
01:22:46 -  come my God and let the life that raised you from
01:22:52 -  the dead be our life let eternal life not be a future consideration
01:22:58 -  but a present ability a present sustenance and all that
01:23:04 -  inheres in your life and it's more than energy it's wisdom it's love that's true
01:23:10 -  it's not shabby affection that is prejudicial and partial
01:23:16 -  and is available to one but not to the other your love is unconditional your wisdom is sublime
01:23:22 -  your integrity is beyond anything that we can attain by keeping our noses clean you alone my God
01:23:28 -  are righteousness and life come my God
01:23:34 -  and fill our vessels with yourself and let it have its expression however foolish
01:23:40 -  it would seem to us however impolite however it would make us to be misunderstood
01:23:46 -  and objects of reproach and derision because we ourselves can't even explain
01:23:52 -  what your life is bidding us to speak and do that offends people rather than seems to
01:23:58 -  bless them but we're your bond slaves my God
01:24:04 -  we're dead unless your life gives us ability
01:24:10 -  to move and live and have our being thank you my God we're cast upon you as
01:24:16 -  as dead men come and let your resurrection continually be
01:24:22 -  responsible and genius of our life save us from mere Charismatica
01:24:28 -  however successful and bring us again to the apostolic verities that once shook
01:24:34 -  the earth and turned the world upside down for the world is as desperately in need
01:24:40 -  this night this Singaporean world this Asian world is as much in need
01:24:46 -  of being turned upside down as was the ancient world into which the apostolic giants came
01:24:52 -  so we bless you Lord come precious God let the words of life
01:24:58 -  that have come not fall to the ground but be taken up in the faith which is even the issue
01:25:04 -  of your life and not our own to change us radically and to be that presence
01:25:10 -  my God for which you yearn and for which you have given yourself and shameful suffering and
01:25:16 -  death that we might enjoy and live by you to the eternal praise of your glory
01:25:22 -  and not the honoring of man and his ability and reputation thank you my God
01:25:28 -  we bow we surrender we relinquish we're dead
01:25:34 -  we're hid with Christ in God let your life be revealed through your own eternal satisfaction
01:25:40 -  praise glory and honor for there is no other motive in Jesus name we pray
01:25:46 -  Amen Amen
