Out of Zion

00:00 -  open up an area that I've never publicly spoken, that I don't even myself likely understand, but maybe the Lord will instruct and inform me out of my own mouth, on the subject of Zion, which is a mischievous word, and there's some
00:19 -  question of whether it's even Hebrew. It might have an etymology and a history that precedes David's conquest of the Jebusite stronghold in the city of Jerusalem, that became through conquest of Joab, an ascending and impenetrable
00:37 -  fortress that these Jebusites thought was unassailable. But Joab took it, and I'm not sure what his name means in Hebrew. Ab means father, and I like to the father in such a way that no matter what curses and deprecatory statements
00:55 -  were coming from these Canaanites Jebusites that were saying, you weak Israelites, you cannot succeed. We are unassailable. He had all the more incentive to storm that precipitous height and take it, and David made that
01:12 -  place his throne room and the city of David and the Zion of God. There's something about the word Zion that I love, that God loves, and that he, in which he puts his name and his presence, and he exalts Zion over all of the places in
01:31 -  the earth. It's a delight to him, but when you see it, if you've been there, it's hardly more than a hill. It's not at all prepossessing, it's not at all some great towering mountain that takes your breath away. It's just a little pimple,
01:45 -  but God has chosen it. He has a fondness and a propensity for pimples, for the weak, for the obscure, for the hidden, for the people without distinction, without credentials, which is the remarkable scripture in Romans chapter 11 that we
02:04 -  started on last night that is inexhaustible, will never come to the end of such weighty statements from the great Apostle. And so when the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, is that verse 26? All Israel shall be saved as it is
02:25 -  written. And then it says, the deliverer will come out of Zion, and he will turn away unGodliness from Jacob, for this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins. What is on my heart tonight is to begin an exploration of the Zion
02:45 -  out of which Israel's redemption comes. We can say from the first reading that that probably means some geographical location out of which the Lord comes from obscurity to come before his people and to do for them what this verse says,
03:03 -  take transgression from them. But there's something in my deeps that goes beyond that, that may include that, that I think it's important for us to consider. This is the Zion out of which deliverance for Israel comes. I believe is a mystical
03:21 -  reference that had to be somehow shielded and covered to a generation that might have understood it, but refers to the believing community of God's people itself, the church. Israel's redemption will come out of some reality, an entity
03:43 -  of the church, when it will come to a condition that somehow is appropriate to the designation Zion. Zion is an ultimate statement. So this is the first opportunity to explore that great word, and I think that there are only two such
04:05 -  references in Paul, in the use of it, but we find it in the Psalms. For example, in Psalm 137, by the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea we wept. When we remembered Zion, we hung our hearts upon the willows in the midst of it, for
04:25 -  there were those who carried us away captive, asked of us a song, and those who plundered us requested mirth, saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land? If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my
04:41 -  right hand forget its skill. If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, and I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy. Remember, O Lord, against the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem, who said, raise it, raise it,
04:55 -  we're going to take it down to the ground, to its very foundation. O daughter of Babylon, who ought to be destroyed, happy the one who repays you as you have served us, happy the one who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
05:11 -  Well, we would need a whole evening just to begin an exploration of this remarkable Psalm, but this much is clear from the very first reading. There is an inveterate hatred of Babylon against Zion. These two locations, these two
05:29 -  polarities, are in utter opposition to one with the other. They are, what's the word, antithetical. Everything that is intrinsic to Babylon is a dead opposition and hatred to that which is intrinsic to Zion. Zion is the ultimate
05:45 -  statement of the holiness and the character of God, and Babylon is everything that is opposed. Here they hang up their harps by the rivers, but some of the translations say by the canals, because we know that Babylon was
06:00 -  one of the great seven wonders of the ancient world, and that it had a network of waterways, that the hanging flower gardens, that was a source of aesthetic beauty and majesty, but also the source of their economy, their rivers, their
06:16 -  transport, the flooding of banks, their agriculture, everything hinged on rivers. Whereas the land of Zion, though it has a river, and it's called the Jordan, it's not the basis for its economy, nor its grandeur, nor its glory. For its economy
06:36 -  and its grandeur does not come from looking down, but from looking up in the God who gives an early rain and a latter rain, to those who keep covenant with him. This requires such exposition, I'm so over my head, but it's a point of
06:53 -  beginning to recognize these antithetical entities. One is religious, commercial, business, Babylon, sin, self-aggrandizement, voluptuous gratification of the senses, luxury, every kind of thing in fact that's
07:11 -  knocking out our door. And how many of us are weeping because we live in the Babylon, and we have we're forgetting Zion, and we're forgetting Jerusalem, and it's no longer dear to our souls. Maybe we've never known it, and therefore we're
07:26 -  not aware of the incursions that Babylon has made even into the Zion that we are called to be and to represent. So there needs to be a conscious recognition of the spiritual forces and powers that are at play between these two great
07:41 -  polarities in which the whole drama of our faith is being walked out in a cosmic way. They wept when they remembered Zion, they couldn't sing, and the fact that their captors required a song of Zion shows the malicious cruelty
08:01 -  of wanting to goad their hapless and helpless captors and rub the salt into their wounds that they are cast out, and that their Jerusalem is destroyed, and that we have been superior in force and power, and now you're at our mercy.
08:16 -  And let's see you sing one of your songs now. There's something vindictive, hateful, spiteful. There's another song, I don't have time to look at it now, in which it describes Jerusalem being destroyed and the temple, the heart of Zion, being
08:31 -  hacked down with hatchets, and they cut the trellises and the artwork and the and all of the delicate frills and the kinds of things that that were inspired in the buildings of that Solomonic temple. They take a relish and then they
08:45 -  burn the the the hewed and hacked down remnant of what was once the glory of God because there's a spiteful malicious hatred against Zion. And yet, if Israel's deliverance does not come out of Zion, it does not come. And what is the Zion that
09:08 -  God is alluding to? Is it yet a piece of geography, or is it something of a symbolic kind that is a final and ultimate statement of the church that has come of age, that has come to maturity, that cherishes Zion, that
09:24 -  cherishes the holy things that constitute the economy and the culture of the kingdom of God? And know that we are presently in exile and we long for and yearn for the establishment of that reality for which we have been saved and
09:41 -  desire to seek God's own people who are in ignorance even of these things to be brought to it. A few thoughts on my bed. Zion, the holy city, is established over the Jebusite location in keeping the principle that God plants his banner
09:59 -  and establishes his rule over the very place as employed by his arch enemies. Have you noticed that? There's something in the in the mystery of the principalities and the powers of the air, of the issue of who is ruling from
10:22 -  the principal location in the city of Jerusalem and Zion. Will it be Jebusites, Canaanites of a kind that put their children through the fire and indulge in temple worship with male and female prostitutes and every vile thing that is
10:39 -  an abomination in God's sight, or will it become the city of David? And David, young king as he was, did not understand the anthropology or the archaeology or perhaps even the spiritual things that I'm trying myself to express and yet he
10:56 -  intuitive because he's David that somehow this location is prime. This is choice. It may not be convenient. It may cost us something to take it, but take it we must for the enemy must not be allowed to have the principal stronghold
11:10 -  in the city of Jerusalem to mock the God whose city that is and that he has chosen as the place to put his name. I want you to know that we're not just speaking about ancient history, we're speaking about present contemporary
11:24 -  struggle. The issues remain the same and the forces that conspire and contend are yet against everything that Zion represents namely ourselves and that people who are intended to return to Zion when mourning and sighing shall
11:41 -  flee away as the redeemed of the Lord even the lost sheep of the house of Israel will be found. There's a Zion to which they must return and be restored and we are the ones who will be the salvific agents of God to aid them and
11:56 -  to help them for the deliverance to them comes out of us. Whatever that means and I want to find out tonight something what that means as I hear it out of my own mouth. This is explorative, this is experimental, this is going for broke,
12:11 -  this is not preaching pretty messages, this is trying to grope and find and probe and sense something in the depths of God's own heart that is on time for us as the church to restore to us a panorama, a framework of understanding
12:26 -  that saviors from prison of triviality and as I said yesterday making one Sunday as another that enhances the church's own appreciation of itself as the Zion of God whose principal function will be Israel's redemption
12:40 -  when indeed it obtains that character. But what is that character? It's holy and so whom occupies the highest mountain? The governing locus is the issue of the centrality of that which affects all nations in the world because as we all
13:03 -  know from Psalm 2 and from Isaiah chapter 2 and Micah 4 1 the law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem and that's not poetry that is God's statement of his theocratic rule as it will affect the
13:21 -  governance of his creation out of the one place which he has chosen Zion for he has put his name there and the Lord does not go forth out of Zion it'll not go forth at all and we'll continue to have anarchy and and looting as we're
13:35 -  seeing this and in Iraq now in Babylon now rightly so and what is the efficacy and the moral restraint of the Islamic religion that when the lid is off and there's nothing to be feared they strip they loot they take greedily and
13:52 -  caught away such things as you wonder how they can even move them or have any value just to possess and to have in the nature of Babylon itself it's a cry for restraint and governance and the government shall one day be upon his
14:06 -  shoulder it's upon his shoulder now and the law shall go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem to all nations no wonder that the powers of darkness so contend in conceding this ground to God where they know that once
14:23 -  it's a pain they are forever finished and if this is their last attempt at holding some measure of ground they will do it vehemently and viciously without pity and spitefully even as we saw in the psalm in the way they go to their
14:40 -  hapless prisoners to sing the song of Zion in a foreign land if I preaching a new gospel or is this another place or is it the faith in its apostolic and prophetic proportions in its cosmic contour that we have not understood
15:00 -  we've got to see our faith in its daily function and its operation and the church in this context we don't see it at all so there's a reason that even David intuitive being David that this stronghold had to be taken even that is
15:21 -  more ancient than history it's primordial it's prehistoric of this contest and conflict between powers of darkness and light vying for a principal location that has to do with the governance either through evil or in
15:36 -  righteousness for the city of God is the place of righteousness and this one Zion will affect other localities to the degree that it becomes a predominant factor in all the world it becomes an axis the naval the the did I say nexus
16:00 -  it's good word the respect the center point of the things that affect the whole of creation and nations and mankind and races of men so it's not likely that David understood these things but his spirit told him that this
16:22 -  genocide fortress that was considered unassailable that no one could take was to be the locus of his own Davidic Kingdom and the Zion of God so there's a pattern no that is both primeval and final there's something that begins
16:45 -  even before history and the recording of these things and the same thing that has its ancient beginning has its final expression in the last days that the law shall go forth out of Zion the same Zion that is contested about through the
17:01 -  forces of darkness that are primordial before history is the same Zion that becomes the principal factor out of which Israel's deliverance comes and out of which the law shall go forth to all creation that remarkable new contemporary
17:14 -  American high school graduates red white and blue apple pie and all of the rest kinds of things that make up the American mainstream in Kansas I've got to know and be comfortable with the confluence of things utterly ancient and
17:33 -  primordial being in inextricable connection with the things that conclude the age in the Zion out of which Israel's deliverance comes and out of which God's governance of creation issues and when you have a framework of
17:47 -  understanding like that you are changed you are set on the road to becoming the Zion of God where the Zion of God has got to somehow rise up above and be beyond our American cultural limitations it's nice apple pie and the
18:04 -  Kansas City basketball team or University can or that's all nice but watch out that it doesn't bring Babylonian overtones that diminishes and dulls the keenness of your spirit of those things that are everlasting and
18:19 -  eternal and significant from God you've got to contend for this I love this country I've never loved it more than I do now I'm clipping out articles of New York Times on the Jewish high school principal whose whole life has been
18:35 -  devoted to teaching and finding innovative ways to teach slum kids and the Pulitzer prizes for journalism that occupied a full page in the New York Times for the correspondence in the war zones and those who wrote on the
18:50 -  corruption in business there's something that well looked in my heart that America you know I love this country there are values here there are truths there's a sense of rightness and and responsibility all the more in contrast
19:04 -  with what we see from our Islamic adversaries I just had a fish meal in Brooklyn just had a hankering for fish and I passed a restaurant I thought one day I'll go in and I did and there's a big sign about Allah Allah is God and
19:20 -  Muhammad is his prophet well so I sat there and I ordered the fillet of soul dinner for ten bucks and it was pretty good well when I came to pay he said it's 12 bucks I showed him the menu said fun oh but we gave you two pieces of
19:38 -  fish well I didn't ask for it you know if you're going to give me something additional give me an option and say would you like another piece of fish it's only you see that's American that's Judeo-Christian that's got to do with
19:52 -  reason and legitimacy and rightness but what is Islamic is get it while you can and don't make any bones about it and just so I'm cherishing what's in this country and yet at the same time I'm saying that we have an obligation beyond
20:10 -  our own culture however precious in this conflict with those that are opposed to it to have something to break in our hearts to have something in our hearts for Zion to desire the ultimate thing of God and to have a breadth of
20:24 -  understanding that is life-changing and that the very embrace of these mysteries and of something that has its origin before time in history and has its ending at the end of the ages of the taste of Israel's redemption and the
20:40 -  government of God for our creation is a framework that not only just gives us a mental understanding but affects our inner man it gives us a sense of seriousness of depth of the purposes of God that had their inception before
20:55 -  time of the historic enmity of the powers of darkness that have contended against God and when they can get their hands on Zion whether it's the temple or the city or the son of God they wreck it and mar it beyond any recognition
21:11 -  that's why the psalmist says let their let their infants be bashed against us they are so horrific that they deserve out of most judgment for they are contemptuous of God and violent against his people and want to resist by every
21:28 -  means that design of God should find fulfillment will not understand the Old Testament prophets will not understand the Psalms will not understand Paul unless we begin to have an appreciation for this sense of Zion that is cited
21:45 -  here and there in installment for they understood and they took the heart this deep mystery it's the very issue of the heart of God because it's the issue of God's selection of a location not because it is physically overbearing and
22:03 -  impressive but because it's least in the sight of men but because it is chosen by God in the God who chooses and the God who elects to favor Zion is to favor the God who has chosen Zion not because it is preeminent and overwhelming in its
22:21 -  stature but because it's least but because we choose what he has chosen there's an affirmation of God when you celebrate Zion and understand why it is that the same God is born in a stable and dies with criminals outside of the
22:39 -  city in the the heaps and the kind of death that he suffered and that his great David has the inception of his kingdom in a cave and that before that to avoid capture and destruction he has to scribble on bill pulse and train
22:56 -  madness and drool in his spirit all of a sudden is a flash of recognition of the genius of what God is who celebrates Zion not because it's ostentatious and visibly impressive but because it's least that's why he chose Israel that's
23:14 -  why he chose us out of the mouths of babes he will perfect wisdom stop the mouth of his adversary who loves ostentation that's who can't you work you ostentation are the palaces of Hussain Saddam Hussein he had over 40
23:36 -  palaces my God how much was a man need but he loves this this overdone voluptuousness of unspeakable luxury that when the American Marines came in their jaws up and they get they've never seen such things marble toilets
23:56 -  and and exquisite fixtures and and things beyond any utility because there's something about Babylon that loves excess that loves voluptuousness that loves the things that are visible or Nate to be seen felt touched have
24:14 -  been possessed but our God chooses the hill but it's the holy hill and we need to choose it also more than choose it we need to be it we need to be whatever Zion means in character as the daughters of Zion the sons of Zion the church that
24:36 -  has come to maturity and the speeds and cherishes what God himself does have you learned that just because you can afford something is not the reason necessary to have it for some of us into Mercedes Benz for me it's the dollar
24:52 -  hamburger now that used to be much more but because it's reasonable and I'm able to afford it is not the reason to have it we've got to begin to think like Zion and not just the appetites on wheels who can gratify it because we
25:09 -  have the enablement we need to impose upon ourselves holy descriptions and live in an appropriate modesty and if we have a means beyond that dispersive for the purposes of the works of God but let's avoid that temptation for the
25:25 -  things that are ornate or spectacular or voluptuous or visible but that is Babylon in that science Zion is modest Zion is precaution science turning the lights out when they're not being used Zion is shutting the water when it's
25:42 -  running needlessly Zion is being irritated when a brother says that he has to wake up with a shower and all that beautiful hot water that cost all that much to produce is to wake up by I'm in and out in two to three minutes I
26:01 -  don't know if I'm ascribing to Zion whatever I have obtained from being at the question baby but I don't think God's offended by a sense of youth carefulness reasonableness proportion modesty good taste
26:25 -  is this the best piece of paper you could find out well it's better than the envelopes that I usually write on so the issue of Zion is the issue of election and we know that in Revelation speaks about the waters of God
26:40 -  springing forth out from under the throne of the temple and out of Zion comes living waters the German word Ursprung the original source comes out of this location to water the earth in righteousness in the knowledge of God
26:59 -  it's not by magic but by the Yahweh who is in the midst of her as it says in Psalm 46 verse 5 and Psalm 48 verse 3 Zion abides and cannot be moved it's the city of peace Jerusalem Shalom city of peace so the whole world
27:19 -  lies in the wicked one the father of lies its values and reality are so controverted that their correct correction constitutes a turning of the world upside down remember that's what they said the Apostles these are they
27:30 -  that turned the world upside down my professor how live me at Columbia University needs to be turned upside down in fact Columbia University itself needs to be turned upside down if you walk into those institutions and sense
27:44 -  their gravity and their weight their prestige and their pump what they resonate with what is the underlying moral value of it is something it's a power that needs to come down it's a wrong value and there are hapless
28:01 -  victims grinding out their lives to obtain certificates and diplomas that they might be on the treadmill toward success in a whole system that celebrates being certificated and having diplomas by industriously fulfilling the needless
28:14 -  requirements of men there's a battle on for truth and righteousness and value and the best of the world both religious and civil Jewish religion and Roman law were the co-conspirers in the crucifixion of our Lord our Master our
28:42 -  God so much for what the world celebrates when it shows its true colors we can only weep in Babylon to the degree that we remember Zion and hold it dear seek its attainment know that I can't even read my scribble that it's
29:05 -  not we are not impressed with this rivers or its canals its humanly contrived waterways that celebrate the pump of men but the horse from the waters of life that issue out from under the throne of heaven the Zion of God to
29:26 -  sing to Jews Zion songs means that we first lament and weep over Zion's loss Paul says that we need to move the Jews to jealousy by what means don't we do it are they going to be impressed with our services and by the way those dances
29:42 -  deserve the greatest of course that was very precious bless you but even with that and ourselves at our best is that the kind of thing calculated to move Jews to envy or must it be a demonstration of a yet more ultimate
29:57 -  kind of a of a climb that is heavenly of an ultimate reality that eclipses and shows by contrast the fought new force of things that are that are offered for men and supposedly constituting reality and value and only a church that is the
30:14 -  church can make that this way it's not for individual virtuosos it's it's for the church in its totality and all of its racial mix and all of its color and variety and shape and size and age bridging the racial disharmonies and
30:28 -  the generational gaps that afflict the world are show forth yet the greater glory of God in the true and unaffected unity and hot bondedness that is to be found in the house of God when it is designed with God I think something like
30:45 -  that will move Jews to jealousy when they will see the thing that is heavenly being set forth before them in the earth and all the more when it's not some calculated production or performance all the more when it's artless when we're
30:58 -  on self-conscious all the more when we're not trying to put our best foot forward all the more that even in our warts and and pimples and and the things that are wrong there's still something that shows forth that is
31:11 -  unmistakably the statement of God there's something about my Jewish people that can recognize when something is phony and something that's true they detected our philandering evangelists long before we even suspected that they
31:25 -  were cavorting and taking such liberties and they would look for a moment and flip them off the TV screen there's a sense of reality that has been tempered by the millennia of Jewish life in the struggle for existence and having
31:39 -  to live by our wits and survive in an inhospitable Gentile world that skills us in discerning things that are false in fact we're in the false business we're the movie makers we're the entertainers we have the dream factories
31:52 -  we produce all those escapist things because we're masters at it and so much as we have a facility for fantasy equally also we know the things that are real so God forbid that we should show them something phantasmical something
32:10 -  that's a production something that's religious may they sense the reality of Zion that cannot even be defined but needs to be displayed and needs to be displayed corporately or not at all and needs to be displayed in the locality
32:26 -  where we are for my Jewish people have gone to condescended to Babylon shockingly they are the leaders in the rap music business in seamy films in corporate greed and dubious schemes to enrich themselves and evade taxes and
32:46 -  and take great loot from their corporations before they dissolved in bankruptcies I winced every time I read such an account and see a Jewish name attached to it and we will one day reap painfully what we are now sewing so we
33:03 -  need to show for the ultimate sign of God what Zion presently is and maybe that will move them to jealousy that's the deliverance that comes from us and through us to them when we ourselves will have attained to what Zion itself
33:19 -  means well another one of my scholarly papers where this New Testament scholar talks about the text that we have read in Romans that out of Zion the deliverance of God shall come and he said Paul is using a verse from Isaiah
33:41 -  chapter 59 verse 20 but in Hebrew the passage speaks of the deliverer coming to or for Zion let's see on in Hebrew but Paul's Greek text probably spoke of a deliverer who comes on behalf of or because of Zion see how cunning Paul is
33:59 -  instead of using the Hebrew edition of Isaiah he draws from the Greek subdueges because in the Greek there's a nuance of meaning that goes beyond to that is spoken of in Isaiah 59 but speaks of coming out from Zion and opens
34:17 -  to Paul a key of understanding of an interpretation that he has intuited and that we ourselves are trying tonight to capture where is called taking the liberty to using scriptures in that with that kind of largest and that kind of
34:35 -  freedom to give it a certain kind of employment that goes beyond the very literal statement to Zion which would have stopped him in his tracks but he says something beyond what Isaiah indicated by his own apostolic authority
34:51 -  and spiritual intuitiveness in the exercise of the creative God who allows such a liberty to those who are yielded to its use as for example myself tonight as for example yourselves tomorrow or Monday or at work or at school there's a
35:13 -  whole creative realm of inventiveness and initiation and things that we have not thought that God will encourage and allow if we're not ourselves locked in to such self-imposed strengths that keep him from giving us a way of seeing and
35:30 -  knowing and understanding that opens dimensions that are on time for us as the Church of God in the last days as for example the subject of sonship not only am I catching it from my Jewish kinsmen I'm catching it from brothers in
35:47 -  the church but your view of sonship we think you're taking great liberties here for the adoption of sons as we read in Romans 8 takes place with the Lord's own appearing when Paul speaks elsewhere that in a moment we will be changed and
36:07 -  we have a glorified body and that constitutes our adoption of sons how then do you dare presume to speak and to suggest that there's a way in which sonship could be understood presently as an attainment even now although it's
36:20 -  final final completion takes place in the Lord's own appearing because the issue of sonship is the issue of Zion and we need not wait for the final consummation that's what we're looking for why didn't you help me because you
36:39 -  didn't do that well in English huh you better learn to love the language and to use it with expertise and don't be afraid to employ your dictionary we are guardians of language and of truth I need to find expression for those things
36:55 -  that are too deep so there's a way that I'm suggesting that the issue of Zion is the issue of sonship it's the issue of maturity it's the coming of age of a church that will be consummated in the Lord's own appearing when we shall see
37:11 -  him we shall be like him and we will experience the adoption of sons how then can you say art that there's a way in which we can enter the realm of sonship even now by the same principle that every appearing of the Lord is a
37:24 -  step toward the realization of ourselves as sons that what is this Paul said of Peter that the Holy Spirit is given to them who obey him and that the path to sonship and maturity is the is the road of obedience and that every obedience
37:44 -  that requires the operation of the Holy Spirit as for example tonight brings with it not only the enablement than the power to speak and probe but also the character of God that is implicit in his spirit that comes with the power did you
38:00 -  ever think about that the spirit of God is the spirit of truth that the spirit is the essence of what God is in himself and though we have only celebrated the power aspect of spirit every communication of spirit in my opinion
38:15 -  communicates God and something is being formed in us of what is intrinsic to God in his own essential character so that every appearing of the Lord by his spirit which we need for obedience also brings something of the revelation or
38:31 -  the essence of himself and what is implied to us is not only the power but the character and the character is the issue of sonship and sonship is the issue of Zion. Now hang me for heresy. Paul's Greek text spoke of a deliverer
38:48 -  who comes on behalf of or because of Zion. Wow that's so much that's saying something so much more than that the deliverer comes out of Zion that sounds geographical and locational but that he comes in behalf of Zion that he'll come
39:06 -  when he sees that that Zion the people of God have attained to a certain correspondence to his own character and life to his own mercy and compassion to his own heart for this people who will be despised all the world over he comes
39:20 -  because of them in behalf of them but in his coming he takes transgression from Jacob according to the covenant that I have made with them which is written it's not something that Israel deserves or something that Israel has obtained or
39:37 -  attained by any virtue of its own he simply comes and takes transgression from Jacob not because of Jacob because of Zion in behalf of Zion we are the key that's the mystery you'd be saying so you didn't get it last night we the issue
39:58 -  of Israel is the issue of the church Israel is done for Israel is finished Israel will be inert they will be the dry bones described by Ezekiel in chapter 37 they'll have nothing in themselves by which they can affect their own
40:11 -  restoration their own redemption they cannot even be allowed to well you know what Jews are we're braggarts we're hot shots we both we take credit this our doing and is that salvation and is that going to equip us to be a nation of
40:26 -  priests in the light of the world that we should boast of the salvation that we obtained by our virtue it's got to be pure and unadulterated gift it has got to come to us not on any basis of our deserving but on the basis of this
40:40 -  nursing of his giving because he has responded to the Zion that has come of age and in behalf of it and because of it he will come as a deliverer to Israel but the issue is with us to become and to attain that character for which he
40:57 -  waits so long as we're slothful so long as we're satisfied with things as they presently are so long as we're service oriented ministry oriented so long as we're satisfied with superficial things and obtaining our limited goals and are
41:10 -  not willing for the sacrifice that is intrinsic to Zion from the very first taking of this bastion that was straight up and that defied any conquest will require the same kind of exertion now spiritually of the kind that Joe had
41:28 -  employed in the taking of that fortress from the Jebusites but where are those who will go up for the father where those who go up for God where those who are willing to strive and to strain and to seek the Lord and to come into the
41:43 -  kinds of realities that Zion signifies and and are willing and will have the courage to turn the chairs around or the pews around and look at each other's faces and and face hard things and hard questions and find our way through to a
41:58 -  quality of life that for the want of any better word is heavenly while it's yet on earth it has all the earmarks of everything that is antithetical to Babylon and it shows forth what is intrinsic to the design of God which is
42:11 -  to say that which is intrinsic to God as God and his character spirit in life we can tell you stories of what it means to live in community for 29 years in hardship in order to seek for these very things that in the years ago we could
42:34 -  not even define but now in retrospect looking back I realized this is what it was about but it took struggling and sacrifice it took disappointment it took disloyalty and treason and misunderstanding and other kinds of
42:49 -  stick luck and things that God's people are capable of and we ourselves as God's people but it's because of Zion that the deliverer will come Paul has a different reading of a deliverer coming from Zion and another commentator by the name of
43:07 -  Ellis says Paul seems to have departed from the traditional text evidently with a hermeneutical purpose and view Paul took the liberty to depart from the traditional way in which the passage in Isaiah is to be understood and gave it
43:21 -  and imparted to it a new kind of valence and meaning and suggestion that opens up a whole round of consideration it has to do with the genius of the church as the church as being the key to Israel's deliverance then this quality and
43:38 -  character shall come how dare he take the liberty he must because that's what an apostle is that is God in any way irritated the provoked that that this apostle should take the scriptures and
43:57 -  use the Greek text in such a way as to open up a door of perspective that is incumbent for us in these last days and that has been hidden and that I've not read anyone commenting on it until this has fallen into my hands of these very
44:12 -  days and I didn't read it until last night or somewhere early this morning very early he's departed with from the traditional text with a hermeneutical purpose in view he's not just playing games he's not just looking for some
44:27 -  innovation that will be cute and a fresh way to avoid boredom and instead of speaking something traditional he has a hermeneutical he has a interpretive purpose in mind and because he has it he's going to find it and because he has
44:41 -  found it and God will give us the grace to learn what he has found and the grace to fulfill what he has found Israel's deliverance will take place to the everlasting glory of God I remind you again of how the great chapters Romans
44:56 -  9 to 11 concludes Paul as setting forth the remarkable mystery sees something of such magnificence that goes beyond even Israel's redemption because how do you how do you understand the final verses of Romans 11 33 to 36 that begins with
45:14 -  all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God I'll tell you what I would give ten bucks just to hear Paul say oh when Paul says oh you get hit in your solar plexus you double over it's not just a little
45:31 -  verbalization it's a gas of something too deep for words oh what has he seen the depth and the riches of the knowledge of God who has been his counselor who shall give to him and it shall not be given again for of him and
45:46 -  through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever I can just see Paul toppling off the platform and and and dissolving into drool and and apoplectic joy because he has seen something more than we have seen great
46:05 -  apostle and son of Israel that he is and rejoicing for the redemption that will come when the deliver comes out of Zion has seen something more he's seen the Zion out of which deliverance comes he sees not only a church a nation that is
46:21 -  redeemed this is a church which is glorified this is a church which is transfigured he sees the church that has lifted up out of its normalcy out of its conventions out of its practices out of its ministry oriented values and goals
46:35 -  and the kinds of things that limited and discouraged it and take on too much to paint the Babylon and he sees it in the glory of God's intention but you know what he sees more than that the church will never come to that condition in and
46:48 -  of itself except only in the challenge that comes to it directly from the Israel who waits for the redemption that comes to it we need Israel as much or more as Israel needs us we need an incentive for sonship and maturity and
47:07 -  the church as church was as a glory to God that is not available to us in the profound sense in which it must come to us except through Israel who's who shall call those dead bones to life the God doesn't do it let it cause a son of man
47:22 -  to do it to prophesy to those bones and there was a son of man box profit that he is can these bones live son of man if you say so what a faltering faith and who would not stagger before the heat of those desiccated bones that if you touch
47:39 -  them they will crumble in your hands and you're going to believe that those bones can live and believe it all the more because you yourself prophesied to those bones you are cats born in Brooklyn New York 1929 195 pounds 202 6 1
47:54 -  full of defects failing this that that out of your mouth and those Kansas City people and the Midwest and Americana and all that little Popeye and McDonald's of the culture that out of people who are framed and born and come
48:12 -  and that will come a collective corporate voice of prophetic obedience that can address those bones that they might live if it will not come from us things it'll not come we have got to come to prophetic stature we have got
48:27 -  to come to fullness the fullness of the Gentiles must come in and when it does you'll know when they'll be recognized as Gentile you'll be recognized as Davidic you'll be recognized as the sons and daughters of Zion you'll be
48:40 -  recognized as the people of God who eclipse and transcend every kind of racial gender designation by which people ordinarily identify themselves America is an identity crisis who am I what am I but to be a son and daughter
48:54 -  of Zion is ultimate designation but it's not a pain cheaply and it's not a pain separately it's a pain together or it's not a pain at all well I'll tell us how what have I told you how as if I could it would no longer be Zion you will be
49:14 -  doing something by the numbers would be mechanical would be something that you could perform that's Babylon if it's to be obtained it's got to be creative innovative Holy Spirit inspired it's got to be the succession of obedience is
49:29 -  that are never comfortable and always require you to an obedience beyond your own capacity to perform that always contains with it the sort of failure of humiliation of defeat of disappointment to others more than yourself if you're
49:43 -  unwilling for those risks there's no attainment design Zion was an ascent to a fortress that thought itself unassailable and it's the same as I said today for those who willing to go up and to take it and to be it but don't tell
49:59 -  me how then we're not told how John did it it was not so much the technique as the intent and the church that has not this intent is not the church it's not so I am it's a cultural phenomenon it's a charismatic billion do we have even
50:17 -  Zion as our intention what is the extent of our intent before God how far do we go how do we define success how much are we embracing those things that have their origin in primordial times before the advent of history and I conclude in
50:37 -  the eschatological future and pertain to the glory of God forever how much is that our framework of consideration even we go about our daily business it's there it hums in our spirit it lingers with us it's continually before us it gets us up
50:52 -  early in the morning to have a devotional time with the Lord so I love what the scholar is saying and I'm utilizing I'm one who synthesizes I take from this I take from that and bring it together in a new kind of an amalgam a
51:06 -  new way of proceeding and seeing that was not available before we need to read scholarly articles we need to read the Christ who will appear from the heavenly Zion is what Paul is describing and that's exactly what Zion is by definition
51:24 -  because it is the identity of the Redeemer of Christ himself you've been remarkably patient and I'll just try and close here's a footnote to the remarks that I've just read where this Ellis explains Paul's innovation as arising
51:45 -  from his identification of the church as the body of Christ how did Paul take this liberty to go beyond what a mechanical reading of Isaiah 59 20 means why did he use the Greek text so as to have the liberty to see something that
52:01 -  is not to Zion but from Zion because he saw in it a statement a hint of the identification of the church as the body of Christ that is the new Zion from which the Redeemer will go forth hey this guy isn't bad isn't it wonderful
52:19 -  when you find yourself confirmed by a scholar you come to the same conclusion and it rings with evident truth it's no poetic explanation it's a reference which appears nowhere else in the book of Romans or the rest of the whole of
52:38 -  the Pauline corpus of all of his writings it's unprecedented it's an attempt to create a Christological symbolism a new statement a goal a definition a point of something that we need to pursue seek and obtain we'll be
52:55 -  happy for that eternally who wants to hear that we have fallen short of the glory of God and that we fail to attain through all that God intended for us in this lifetime and that when the Lord comes with his rewards to bring to every
53:10 -  man for his the works that he has performed we receive none who will want to live eternally who has not had crowned to lay before the feet of the Holy One of Israel because we live lives so modest and so wanting in true
53:26 -  apostolic and prophetic significance that there was no crown to obtain no crown to lay our Christian life was a succession of services keeping our Kansas noses clean and avoiding conspicuous sin and getting by we had
53:39 -  no vision we didn't share with Paul the thing that eventuates in the glory of God forever and we're that final generation by which that last day's consummation will take place when the redemption of Israel comes out of Zion
53:56 -  the redeem of the redemption will issue from Zion and only from Zion when Zion is in fact Zion I rest my case let's pray Lord we don't know what we're talking about really but we sense that what we're talking about is dear to your
54:22 -  heart and we're not going to know it in any kind of factual or mechanical way in which we can boast this is something that needs to be intuitive this is something that needs to be apprehended that needs to apprehend us so wake us
54:40 -  up in the night hours with one word softly spoken Zion Zion show us when we're hesitating between the purchase of two things and that we were tempted to indulge ourselves in the luxury beyond any need we'll hear the whisper Zion give
54:57 -  us a restraint as sons and daughters when a decision has to be made where we could have indulged ourselves and no one would have censored us but that we know that you're looking and that somehow it affects not only our own personal life
55:10 -  and character but those with whom we're joined for we're in something together resign my God upon our spirits give us a love for it of the kind that you have for as much as you love it the enemy your adversary your ancient adversary
55:28 -  hates it and we love what you love and we hate what you hate Lord we long for Israel's redemption totally undeserved and you're not waiting for them to repent you're not even waiting for them to see their sin you will just simply
55:44 -  come and take transgression from Jacob and once their transgressions are removed what will they not see what will they not be able to believe what will they not be able to become the light to the nations and the nation of
55:58 -  priests for which they will call and for which the world is in desperate need that loots and grabs and exploits at every opportunity come my God finish the great redemptive saga through the church that is the church that has come of age
56:13 -  the sons and daughters of God will move to maturity and identification with you with every act of obedience in the things to which you call us which we would never embrace because there's the fear of failure because it requires
56:29 -  something because there's a relinquishing and a giving up because we're fearful and timid with every obedience in those requirements something is imparted out of your spirit that is more than just the enablement
56:42 -  than the power it's the life of God which is the character of God and the nature of God by which every such infusion through obedience brings us more and more into your image for you're bringing many sons to glory so my God
56:59 -  spoil any lesser ambition that anyone in this room has had to know of what religious success means or any such thing and give us such a palpitating heart to be the jealous sons and daughters of the living God sons and
57:15 -  daughters of Zion I bless this people Lord for you have created this occasion and you have given a people who can draw your heart out who are not nervously watching the clock to wonder when is this speaker going to stop who want to
57:30 -  hear every syllable and every word that issues from the throne of heaven even if it's a statement of a first kind that bewilders or even confuses if we're willing because even when our minds are not fruitful something is going into our
57:43 -  spirit that will later be brought to the level of consciousness and understanding and enactment so Lord receive our gratitude surely we have come to such an hour for radical utterance for the pulling out of the
57:57 -  stops for the fulfillment of the things which Paul took that liberty all those millennia ago to come to transpose and convert and give to a familiar passage in Isaiah a new rendering in a meaning fought with significance whose time for
58:12 -  fulfillment is now we say we're willing Lord for whatever it costs come my God have so precious a people whose time has come and out from whom your deliverance to the people Israel shall come and for that we thank you and give you praise
58:32 -  for the high privilege of God in Christ Jesus which we receive a new tonight in whatever the cost and whatever the loss whatever the bewilderment whatever the could the misunderstanding of people thought we've gone off the deep end and
58:46 -  you can't talk about sonship until the adoption in the Lord's coming all those kinds of things that rail against us has railed against the children who were required to sing the song songs of Zion in a foreign land we bless you Lord we're
59:01 -  one with them we cherish the thing that they long for and from which they were expelled and look for the day that they shall return and Zion again will be the holy center of all creation and nations will come up to it and give homage and
59:18 -  honor to the God of Israel at the Holy Hill of Zion worshiping the God who has set all this in motion in his great wisdom we bless you Lord here here the what your saints are saying in their hearts right now I'm not asking for any
59:36 -  any consecration any response any coming to the altar any standing any raising of your hand but I'm asking say something to God in your heart he's waiting to hear something in your inner man that says yes Lord I hardly know how to want how to
59:53 -  understand but my spirit is reverberating my spirit is responding my spirit knows that there's a call here to challenge here of so ultimate a kind that it could be the death to everything that I've cherished and
01:00:07 -  labored for in all my life long because who knows where this will lead I want to be a son and daughter of obedience where so ever you shall be yes Lord I I'm in roles I I ascribe to this word I say yes thank you Lord in the heart of America
01:00:25 -  let this word have its inception at its commencement and let it radiate out to the rest of the nation and to the nations we thank and give you praise for our privilege in Jesus name and God's people said amen
