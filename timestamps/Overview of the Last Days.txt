Overview of the Last Days

00:00 -  But it will go through you and beyond you to the Church of all Latin America. So we have been praying in a remarkably ambitious way for the Lord. That He would lay foundations for the Church that cannot be moved.
00:31 -  And the end result is a highway of holiness. Which my Jewish people shall tread throughout the whole of Latin America. In the last days on their way to Zion.
00:55 -  We'll speak more of this later. But the reality needs to be established tonight and tomorrow night. Through the word which the Lord will send.
01:14 -  In the beginning was the word. So Lord we're asking in your precious jealousy over your own purpose and will.
01:25 -  Which we understand only in part. That you will redeem this night. And all of the occasions before us in these days.
01:43 -  To lay your own foundation. To not only bless the Church but make the Church a blessing. That the Church itself will be the highway of holiness.
02:03 -  In which your people shall pass over. So speak Lord. For these great purposes.
02:15 -  Filling my mouth with good things. Opening the ears and hearts of your people. And the remarkable phenomenon of your word.
02:31 -  Even as it constitutes an event. More than instruction. But establishes something.
02:44 -  Even by the speaking. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
02:55 -  Amen. Amen. Amen.
03:02 -  Amen. Thank you. Some of you may have been offended last night after the service who came up for personal prayer.
03:26 -  Instead of answering your request as I could easily have done. I asked you a question. Have you brought this request to the elders of your own Church?
03:47 -  Before coming up to us. And most were surprised by the question. No, they had not done so.
04:00 -  Or they come from congregations where the elders leave something to be desired. I said you go to them nevertheless. Because there is something at issue here more important than your personal need.
04:26 -  It's the issue of the government of God. Which is the issue of the kingdom of God. Which is the issue of the word of God.
04:38 -  If any among you be sick. Let him call for the elders of the Church. Let them anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith.
04:51 -  So they might be healed. We don't want to circumvent that requirement in God's word. Because it weakens and demoralizes the Church.
05:12 -  And robs the elders of their responsibility. And the exercise of their authority. That's why they are weak.
05:24 -  Because you haven't called upon them. And reminded them of their responsibility. To be in that place of God.
05:35 -  That can confer blessing. In the local body in the assembly. We must honor the principles of God.
05:47 -  And be turned away from personality. The visiting speaker. As if he has some special kind of magic.
06:07 -  And that assures the immaturity of the Church. So we want to turn the attention away from ourselves. And direct your attention to where it belongs.
06:28 -  To the elders of your own Church. And to find your healing there. To find your healing there.
06:38 -  And not in some magical hope that has to do with a visiting speaker. Nor his personality. So don't feel insulted if we direct you in that way.
06:54 -  It will be a blessing for you, a blessing for the elders. That the Church might be the Church. And divine order be restored to the Church.
07:09 -  In the respect for its authority and government. And the preeminence of the word of God. If any among you be sick, let him call.
07:24 -  For the elders of the Church. That's humiliating. You know them too well.
07:34 -  You see them in their humanity. They don't have that mysterious charismatic quality that the visiting speaker has. But if you knew us as well as you knew your elders.
07:49 -  There's no special magic about us. So let us grow up rightly unto the Lord. Amen.
08:07 -  Amen. I think that by and large we're much more sick than we should be. We are more sick than we ought to be.
08:29 -  We have too many ailments. And I think that the problem is our preoccupation with ourselves. We are too much the center of our own concern.
08:49 -  Which roots us in the earth. We're looking down. How we feel, how we appear, our condition.
08:59 -  When God calls us to look up. We are heavenly minded people. So we need to break the power of self interest.
09:13 -  Self centeredness. Even as Christians. Because all that is earthly is carnal.
09:24 -  Selfish. And even devilish. Gives the enemy opportunity.
09:33 -  When we are preoccupied with ourselves. And the things of the earth. God has given the church a remarkable provision in this regard.
09:57 -  That provision is Israel itself. So when the church in Rome asks Paul, Is God finished with the Jew?
10:11 -  What does he answer? God forbid you should think that. They have only momentarily stumbled.
10:27 -  Even in the crucifixion of their own messiah. So that salvation might come to the gentiles. So as to move them to jealousy.
10:44 -  That's in the book of Romans chapter 11. I think it's verse 11. What a remarkable statement.
10:55 -  Salvation has come to the gentiles through the momentary fall of the Jew. But there's a purpose in God. For which reason salvation?
11:11 -  But there's a purpose in God. For which reason salvation has come. Which was such an astonishment that required Peter to receive a vision in a trance.
11:32 -  For salvation is of the Jews. And Peter was asleep on the roof of the house in Jaffa. And the Lord brought him into a trance.
11:45 -  And he saw a vision of a scrawler, a parchment coming down. Full of pictures of unclean animals. That Jews were forbidden to eat according to the law.
12:04 -  And the voice said to Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter. Kill and eat. And even in his trance he cries out as the orthodox Jew.
12:19 -  Lord you know I have never eaten anything unclean. And the Lord said what I have made clean, call thou not unclean. In that moment there's a knock at the door.
12:42 -  A group sent by a Roman authority. That Peter would come and speak to them about the holy faith. Having received the trance that is no longer unclean, Peter went.
13:06 -  Because otherwise he would not have entered the house of the uncircumcised. And as he was sharing in this house of the Roman with his family and staff. About what had happened in Pentecost.
13:27 -  While he was speaking the spirit fell on those who were listening to him. And they began to speak with other tongues. Exactly of the kind that Peter and the disciples experienced.
13:45 -  Peter said how shall we deny them baptism in water seeing they have received the same gift. It was an astonishment. God was saving Gentiles.
14:01 -  And the salvation which is of the Jews. And giving them the same spirit. And that never happened before.
14:11 -  This was unprecedented. That such grace and mercy should come to the Gentiles. And they came back with the report to Jerusalem.
14:23 -  God has done something new. He's establishing a church. Both of Jew and Gentile.
14:31 -  As one new man. We need to appreciate the gracious gift that has come to us. It was far off and without God and without hope in the world.
14:52 -  You have received the salvation intended for the Jews. And have shared with them in their faith. In their covenant, their hopes, their promises.
15:05 -  So later on Paul is explaining to such a church. Who are asking is God finished now with the Jew? Are we now the new Israel?
15:18 -  God forbid you should think that. They are only temporarily set aside. The natural branches have been broken off that you might be granted.
15:30 -  So through their false salvation has come to the Gentiles. And Paul adds that one further statement. So as to move them to jealousy.
15:49 -  Let that sink deep into your hearing. Let that sink deep into your hearing. For you are not exempt from that responsibility two thousand years later.
16:08 -  You cannot plead that, well, I'm not capable. I'm just an ordinary believer. I have no distinction.
16:21 -  I can't begin to impress these Jews. There's no excuse for the church anywhere. Because this is not only a provision for the Jew.
16:35 -  It's a provision for the church itself. There's a purpose for your salvation beyond yourself. And a purpose of such magnitude.
16:50 -  That it has the power to break self-interest. Ego-centrism. The deep thing that keeps the whole of mankind in bondage.
17:08 -  Self-centeredness. I, me and mine. My health, my economy.
17:21 -  Me, me, me. So, in the world before we were saved. That self-centeredness was expressed in wanting a different car, better place to live, food.
17:37 -  But when we come into the church, we bring it with us. We bring it with us. We still have this orbit, this centeredness.
17:49 -  But it may not be expressed so carnally. But we are still the center of our own universe and our own world. So we are a congregation of individualities.
18:08 -  More than the organic body of Christ, which is the genius of the church. More than the organic body of Christ, which is the genius of the church. What can break and cancel this so great power?
18:30 -  We are first and foremost in our own consideration. The purpose of God. To move the Jew to jealousy.
18:44 -  And Paul doesn't tell us how. But it's got to come through you. It's the reason for your salvation.
18:55 -  Beyond the benefit which salvation has brought. You need to recognize the mystery of God. In the church and the Jew.
19:07 -  Which is as binding tonight as the day in which Paul first spoken. A church that is ignorant of that mandate, of that requirement. Will retain its selfish character.
19:28 -  It will become a thing unto itself. It will live for its own enjoyment. It will be outside the purposes of God.
19:39 -  It will fall short of the glory of God. It will have no place in his eternal purpose. And glory.
19:58 -  I'm glad that the Lord restrained Paul not to tell us how to move them to jealousy. But I want you to sense the magnitude of this responsibility. That cannot be demonstrated as individuals.
20:20 -  But only in the totality of the church as the church. You've got to exhibit something together. Another kind of reality.
20:34 -  As seen in your relationship. In speaking the truth in love. In the way in which you respect each other.
20:46 -  You're not stopped by differences. Of race, of nationality, of sex. It's a nationality.
20:58 -  It's another society. Of a heavenly kind. That is rooted in love.
21:06 -  And righteousness. And truth. That speaks and does and acts rightly.
21:14 -  And is not selfish. Is sacrificial. Exhibits the character and nature of God.
21:24 -  It's a piece of a kingdom already come. That has never seen. And could not themselves know.
21:34 -  Because it's the work of the spirit. By those who have the spirit. The church.
21:44 -  Amen. Thank you Lord. I'm walking ever so carefully.
22:06 -  I don't want to overload you. But I want you to turn to Ephesians chapter 3.
22:16 -  And show you another piece. Of the apostle Paul's wisdom and understanding. By which the church becomes the church.
22:30 -  As more than a place for a succession of services. And benefits that we would receive. Although of course there are benefits.
22:44 -  They are not the first purpose for our being as a church. God has established the church of the gentiles. To perform a particular function for his people Israel.
22:58 -  To move them to jealousy. And also to extend mercy. And they might obtain mercy.
23:08 -  Because the hour is coming. And is now at hand. When Jews the world over will need mercy.
23:18 -  Or they will all together perish. In Ephesians chapter 3. Paul reminds the church of his
23:30 -  commission and call. That we might understand the knowledge which is his in the mystery of Christ in verse 4.
23:42 -  Of the things which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men. As it is now revealed.
23:52 -  As with holy apostles and prophets. By the spirit. That the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body.
24:02 -  As partakers of the promise in Christ in the God. Paul is summing up what I have already said. Of this remarkable mystery.
24:18 -  Being revealed now. That the gentiles who were far off. Without hope, without God in the world.
24:28 -  Have now been brought near by the blood of the Messiah Jesus. That they should be fellow heirs with the Jews. In the same body.
24:40 -  Partakers of his promise. In their Messiah. Through the gospel.
24:50 -  What a remarkable revelation. That we have taken all together for granted. Have not understood.
25:00 -  Have not appreciated. And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling. And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling.
25:12 -  And therefore we are living beneath the glory of our calling. We think we invented the church. No, it is a continuation.
25:24 -  Of the faith already understood and held by believing Jews. Of the faith already understood and held by believing Jews. And you are being joined together with them into the same body.
25:36 -  And you are being joined together with them into the same body. To have part in their promises and their inheritance in the gospel. To have part in their promises and their inheritance in the gospel.
25:46 -  Of which he has made a minister. Before that you were wild branches. That could not bear fruit.
26:00 -  By its very nature. But God has grafted you into their tree. But God has grafted you into their tree.
26:08 -  That you might receive the sap and the life through the root. And the fruit buried. A special fruit.
26:18 -  That cannot be had and formed. Except through the life flowing through the sap. And it is that fruit that will move them to jealousy.
26:28 -  And it is that fruit that will move them to jealousy. Because they themselves cannot bear it. Because they are broken off out of their own tree.
26:36 -  Because they are broken off out of their own tree. Paul says don't you boast. Let you be broken off.
26:46 -  For if you don't hesitate to break them off. For unbelief. For if you don't hesitate to break you off.
26:54 -  Therefore do not boast. You do not support the root. Because the root supports you.
27:02 -  So be fruit bearing. By the life that is now available to you. When you are consciously
27:12 -  When you are consciously Grafted into their root. And understand it.
27:20 -  And are grateful for it. And receive the benefit of it. Otherwise
27:30 -  You remain a dead fruitless branch Even though you are grafted in. The sap flows by your gratitude.
27:40 -  By your awareness. That you are grateful To be grafted into their tree.
27:50 -  And you are not too proud So as to despise it. You count it as privilege.
28:00 -  To be grafted into Israel's tree. Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Of the patriarchs and the prophets.
28:10 -  Of the holy prophets and apostles. The whole history of that people. Then Paul continues.
28:30 -  So I made a minister according to the Grift of the grace of God.
28:38 -  Unto me who am less than the least of all saints. Verse 8 Is this grace given?
28:48 -  That I should preach among the Gentiles The unstruggable riches of Christ. And to make all men see
28:56 -  What is the fellowship of the mystery Which from the beginning of the world Has been hidden in God
29:02 -  Who created all things by Jesus Christ To the intent that now Stop.
29:10 -  We are not going to read this quickly. We need to prepare ourselves. The chief apostle
29:20 -  The chief apostle Who is the least of all saints in his own estimation Because the more authentically
29:32 -  Spiritual you become The more you recognize your least. Therefore to him can be given
29:44 -  The revelation of the mystery Hidden from the beginning of all time That now is to be revealed
29:54 -  That God who has created all things Through Jesus Christ In order that
30:04 -  And here is where we should stop breathing In order what Paul? What's the purpose for God creating all things
30:14 -  What's the purpose for God creating all things What's the purpose of this creation This world
30:22 -  The races and nations of men The resources God has placed in the earth That's only an enablement
30:32 -  But it's not the purpose It makes the purpose possible The great apostle
30:40 -  Is about to tell us Is about to tell us What is God's purpose
30:46 -  In having created all things In having created all things Through Jesus Christ
30:52 -  In order that Are you ready? In order that
30:58 -  Through the church Through the church Under the principalities and powers in heavenly places
31:04 -  Under the principalities and powers in heavenly places My verse 10 My verse 10
31:12 -  Might be known the manifold wisdom of God Amen In order that through the church
31:26 -  Let this sink in dear saints God has created all things In order that
31:36 -  Through the church If we were not told anything more This we know
31:46 -  That in God's sight The church was so important to him That he did not think it extravagant
31:54 -  That he did not think it extravagant To create the whole world and the universe In order for the church
32:00 -  In order for the church That something might be performed Through the church
32:06 -  And only and exclusively Through the church We need to wake from our sleep
32:16 -  Church is more than a succession of services Even good services It's a mystery
32:24 -  That goes back to creation That God foresaw the church And his purpose through it
32:32 -  That required the creation of all things May you rise to the importance Of what it means
32:44 -  To be a member in the church Of Jesus Christ in the world For which reason God has created all things
33:02 -  Because we're suffering From a sense of inferiority We're poor
33:12 -  And we don't have large things In which to boast We don't have a makeshift church
33:20 -  It's not a glass cathedral We don't have many material advantages And we're living beneath
33:30 -  The estimation That we ought to have Of the church
33:38 -  Which if we understood it Would enable us to rise To the stature and the fullness
33:46 -  Of Jesus Christ Until a perfect man Oh, if you could but see
33:54 -  Oh, if you could but see it Oh, if you could believe it What a calling
34:02 -  And what is it For which we have been created The church and the world
34:10 -  To demonstrate The manifold wisdom of God To the principalities and powers
34:20 -  In heavenly places Now that is stupefying What kind of wisdom
34:34 -  And to whom is this demonstration made It's not even for the world It's something in the air
34:44 -  The principalities and powers of the air That this is important to God This is very important to God
34:52 -  He wants to demonstrate something to them That will bring a final defeat To their influence in the world
35:02 -  And can only come through the church I'm always wanting to pray Again for more grace
35:14 -  I'm holding my breath As if the whole history and future Of this congregation
35:26 -  This work Of the church of Latin America Is hanging in the balance
35:32 -  Right now In the understanding and the receiving Of this mystery
35:40 -  Of which Paul is made a steward That he might teach the church The inestimable riches in Christ
35:52 -  And the reason for its own existence Beyond its own enjoyment Beyond its own self-centered interests
36:02 -  Beyond the issue of its health Its poverty Its possessions
36:08 -  Its reputations Its enjoyment There's a purpose in God
36:16 -  To make a demonstration That would never occur to us To be important
36:26 -  But the fact that he has created All things for this What to persuade us
36:34 -  That it's important for him And he did not think it extravagant To create all things the world
36:46 -  That it could support the church So that it might make this demonstration Of the manifold wisdom of God
36:58 -  To the principalities and powers of the air That cannot even be seen That are invisible
37:08 -  Over every nation Including Mexico Every city and locale
37:18 -  Including Monterrey And have been exerting throughout all time Their influence
37:26 -  Their power To suppress mankind To excite anger and violence
37:32 -  And bloodshed and death Because they have another wisdom That is based on selfishness
37:42 -  Not ambition And they want to rule They want to influence
37:48 -  They want to jerk and manipulate Nations and peoples And they've been having a field day till now
37:58 -  As history shows it History shows it In Africa
38:04 -  Black against black Wholesale genocide by the million Men, women and children
38:16 -  In bloodthirsty anger Because they're not on the same tribe Because the pride of one people
38:26 -  Has been excited against that of another Oh, you dear saints If you will not
38:38 -  And cannot Understand That there's an invisible
38:44 -  Realm of reality that Roots over nations And exerts
38:52 -  Its sinister Nefarious influence To jerk
38:58 -  And manipulate men To cause violence, riot, disorder Chaos, death
39:08 -  Then you are naive And you're lost to the purposes of God Then you don't know where the action is
39:18 -  And everything that you do Is beating against the air Is futility
39:26 -  Not recognized Not understood Not come to a maturity of understanding
39:34 -  To recognize this conflict And our place in it Is bringing it to an end
39:42 -  Through the church You say, brother, if that's true Where in recent history
39:58 -  Has there been a demonstration Of this influence? That can actually
40:06 -  Though it's invisible And in the air over cities and nations As any man knows who travels
40:16 -  Between nations As I have I'm merely crossing the border
40:24 -  You're breathing another air There's something in the air That's different than other than
40:32 -  The country from which you've just come That shows the influence of the Principalities and powers in that place
40:42 -  And keeping with the history of that place And you can feel The opposition
40:50 -  It's real What's the greatest demonstration In recent times of this truth?
41:00 -  Nazi Germany The most Civilized
41:12 -  Highly accomplished nation Civilization That has given to the world
41:18 -  Beethoven Mozart Do you know these names?
41:24 -  These great composers? Am I just freaking over the head? Do you know what philosophy means?
41:30 -  Great philosophers Great theologians Great poets
41:36 -  Great ethics Great culture, great civilization But in the space of ten years
41:44 -  Some gutter snipe In the bottom of beer cellars Led by occultic influences
41:56 -  Celebrating the swastika The broken cross Formed a political reality
42:06 -  Of which the Jews said This shall pass This nation with its history will not tolerate that
42:16 -  Such a piece of scum as that Will never rise to any kind of place of influence And within two or three years
42:26 -  He was the chancellor of Germany And Nazism had taken possession Of a great nation
42:34 -  And set in motion The development of its military power That it could sweep through its neighbor nations
42:44 -  Poland Czechoslovakia Austria
42:50 -  No one could stop them They conquered the whole of Europe And were stopped only by Russia
42:58 -  In the Russian winter Or else they would have conquered the world In the process of which
43:08 -  They systematically annihilated Six million Jews Called the Holocaust
43:16 -  Oh dear saints Don't you know about this That you have a responsibility
43:24 -  Of the church To have some understanding of history And what is happening in the world
43:32 -  And what might yet happen And understand what the root of the evil is That not only can influence nations
43:42 -  But possess them And perform its evil Especially against the Jew
43:52 -  Which they hate Why? Because they know better than you
44:02 -  If the Jew is ever restored To the God of their fathers If the redeemed of the Lord ever return to Zion
44:12 -  The king will come Who said to them, you'll not see me again Until you shall say
44:20 -  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord The Jew shall say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
44:42 -  Will you understand me when I say The return of Israel Is the coming of the king
44:52 -  Not the present political state Which is yet to experience judgment Uprooting and expulsion
45:08 -  At the final restoration Spoken by the prophets since the world began The king will come
45:18 -  And take his place Upon the holy hill of Zion As the son of David
45:28 -  Qualified to sit upon the throne of David And rule not only over Israel But over all nations
45:38 -  And that will mark the end Of the false rule And influence
45:44 -  Of the principalities and powers of the air Amen We have prayed that the Lord would enlarge
45:58 -  Your capacity to receive These things The church is called
46:12 -  To a great last days drama The conclusion of all the ages The coming of the king
46:24 -  Who was born to rule Out of Bethlehem shall he come forth unto you Whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting
46:36 -  Whose to be ruler in all Israel That the law might go forth out of Zion And the word of God out of Jerusalem
46:50 -  The church is called To a great last days drama The conclusion of all the ages
47:04 -  The coming of the king Who was born to rule Out of Bethlehem shall he come forth unto you
47:14 -  Whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting Whose to be ruler in all Israel That the law might go forth out of Zion
47:28 -  And the word of God out of Jerusalem To all nations That they would study war no more
47:40 -  Amen These powers crucified Christ Paul says in 1 Corinthians
48:06 -  If they had known They would not have crucified the lord of glory He said, but brother I thought the Romans crucified him
48:20 -  They were the instrument But the wisdom and the will Based on these powers
48:30 -  Expressing their fury and their anger And their indignation Against God and the son of God
48:38 -  Thinking to remove him from death Who received their vicious death In humility
48:48 -  With a complaint And did not answer back in kind He did not answer back
48:58 -  He went as a lamb to the slaughter He went as a lamb to the slaughter Silently
49:08 -  He didn't complain that I'm innocent of what I'm being charged You need to stop what you're doing I don't deserve this fate
49:20 -  How dare you I'm the son of God Not a single complaint
49:26 -  Not a single complaint Nothing in his own defense He had to fulfill the prophetic word
49:36 -  He went silently as a lamb to the slaughter And when the people were provoked By the powers to antagonize him
49:48 -  Come down from the cross and we will believe you Come down from the cross and we will believe you In everything that should have brought him to a boil of resentment
50:00 -  That they're mocking him even in his suffering like to death If ever he had a reason to be indignant And you'll let them have it
50:14 -  You unbelieving Jews I suffer for you And even in my agony I have to be listening to your mockery
50:24 -  Then let this curse be upon you He answered not a word Because in his death
50:34 -  And in his suffering He was revealing the wisdom of God The character of God
50:44 -  The willingness to suffer Without complaining Even if it was unfair
50:50 -  Trusting the Father To vindicate him eternally And saying of his tormentors
51:02 -  Let not this sin be to their charge Forgive them For they know not what they do
51:10 -  He was full of mercy And more consideration for his tormentors And more consideration for his tormentors
51:18 -  Than for himself So Paul tells us in Colossians That in his suffering and death at the cross
51:32 -  He inflicted a defeat Upon the principalities and powers He publicly revealed them
51:44 -  And disarmed them But he did not extinguish them He left that for you
51:56 -  They suffered a basic defeat They are stripped and disarmed But they still continue to function
52:08 -  Through intimidation and threat And lust To move mankind
52:16 -  Away from God To the Gods of this world Therefore Paul says
52:24 -  In chapter 6 of Ephesians We wrestle not against flesh and blood But against the principalities and powers of the air
52:36 -  The world rulers of this state Those who rule this world And this age of darkness
52:46 -  That's the reason for the drug trade And for corruption in governments And authorities that can be bribed and paid off
52:56 -  And elections won or lost by bribery The world is corrupt And its governments
53:04 -  And its vicious Its trade, its prostitution Its drugs, its pride
53:10 -  We don't wrestle against flesh and blood But against the root of evil The principalities and powers of the air
53:20 -  The rulers of this world's darkness Which is why Jesus said The prince of this world comes
53:28 -  But he has nothing against me Wake up, dear saint We're called into a war
53:36 -  And we're included We begin it, we finish it We wrestle
53:58 -  This is not some light activity Because the weapons of our warfare Are not carnal
54:08 -  But spiritual To the bringing down of strongholds Through prayer
54:16 -  Through intercession Through fasting Through true worship
54:22 -  Through obedience and sacrifice That's the wisdom of God Demonstrated by the church
54:28 -  That is the church That is the wing who can wrestle And fight
54:50 -  There is a purpose for our being That we need to recognize And receive
54:58 -  As ultimate responsibility That we would say with the Apostle Paul Who is sufficient for these things
55:10 -  Lord, you have called us to that which is Beyond ourselves Well-meaning intention cannot fulfill this requirement
55:20 -  Even to be charismatic or Pentecostal We have got to be charismatic Even to be charismatic or Pentecostal
55:30 -  We have got to come into the reality Of the life of God Himself Into the Overcomer
55:38 -  Into His resurrection power Into His authority As the Son of God
55:46 -  Who was resurrected and ascended And enthroned exalted on high We have to reach that level
56:00 -  We have an apostolic responsibility That can only be fulfilled on the apostolic ground Which is the resurrection life
56:12 -  Of the ascended Christ Not just the acknowledgement of the truth Of the doctrine of resurrection
56:20 -  Not just the knowledge of the doctrine But the actual appropriation That we might say with Paul
56:32 -  For me to live is Christ That is the reason why You can ask my brother Tony
56:46 -  And we have been together in many places in the world He says the greatest things That ever issue from you
56:56 -  Is when you are exhausted Weak, uninspired Because it gives God the greater opportunity
57:08 -  To be all in all To be all in all Can God succeed
57:22 -  In making of the Latin American Church In all of its Spanish Latin and Romantic culture
57:36 -  An apostolic reality Then when they are sick They need to call for the elders of the church
57:48 -  They need to subscribe to the word of God They need to humble themselves And ask prayer from men whom they know
58:00 -  And weaknesses they have seen And yet believe That those same men
58:08 -  Can by a prayer of faith bring healing And they are not to be overlooked In preference to the visiting speaker
58:22 -  Who appears to be so anointed That you would bypass the government of God And be encouraged in your immaturity
58:34 -  To run after personalities And seek to be healed When your sickness has more to do
58:44 -  With that kind of immaturity and spiritual condition Than you know If we are going to defeat the powers of the air
58:54 -  It's by a people who have come of age Who obey the word of God Who respect the authority of God in the church
59:04 -  And make the authority respect itself And make the authority respect itself Only a church of this kind
59:36 -  Displaying a reality of this kind Can move Jews to jealousy Nothing less, nothing other
59:50 -  But a church that has come of age To a people who have no distinction in themselves To whom God has taken off the dung heap
01:00:06 -  Who are beggars of the dung heap Or would die also at one And he makes to sit with the princes of his people
01:00:20 -  And makes them the nobility of God The aristocracy of the kingdom Men and women who have come of age
01:00:30 -  Of maturity Of responsibility Who are living lives appropriate to the kingdom
01:00:38 -  And the glory to which they are called Who will not make excuses for themselves Oh brother, I didn't have your advantage
01:00:50 -  I never had education I come from a poor family I never had a real father
01:01:00 -  We have all things in him With whom we have to do The wisdom of God is this
01:01:20 -  That he has chosen The weak and the foolish thing To confound the world
01:01:32 -  In what it thinks is wise and powerful That out of the mouths of babes and sucklings He has perfected wisdom
01:01:44 -  So as to stop the mouth of his adversary Amen The Lord has made the poor
01:02:08 -  To be rich in faith In James chapter 2 In the book of James chapter 2
01:02:20 -  The apostle James tells us Harken my beloved brethren What does that mean, harken?
01:02:32 -  What does that mean, harken? Don't just listen casually Hear this
01:02:40 -  This is your deepest consideration Has not God chosen the poor Of this world rich in faith
01:02:54 -  And heirs of the kingdom Which he has promised to them that love him But you have despised the poor
01:03:06 -  It's not only the rich who have despised the poor But the poor who have despised the poor Who despise themselves
01:03:20 -  And think little of themselves And are not living in the dignity Which is their gift in the salvation of God
01:03:32 -  That God has appointed that the poor Should be rich in faith And are not to be despised
01:03:42 -  Because they are poor Because they are weak Because they are foolish in the world's sight
01:03:52 -  Because through such a people And only such a people Will the glory of God be obtained
01:04:02 -  When he defeats the principalities and powers of the air And he will celebrate power, strength Learning, prestige, wealth, force
01:04:12 -  Violence He will defeat them By the demonstration of his own wisdom
01:04:22 -  In the beauty of holiness In the simplicity of the saints Whom he has taken off the dung heap
01:04:34 -  And made to sit with the princes of his people And has given to them his spirit And the gifts of the spirit
01:04:44 -  Is the gift of wisdom and knowledge and understanding And discernment And every provision for Godliness in life
01:04:54 -  That they might together constitute a church Of an organic kind Really joined
01:05:04 -  As the body of Christ Every joint supplying A body that can wrestle
01:05:12 -  And discern and recognize The evil over their own country Over their own locality
01:05:20 -  And defeat it Not by carnal means But by spiritual means
01:05:26 -  Through intercessions Through prayers, through fasting Rightly enforcing the powers of darkness
01:05:32 -  That have kept the entire locality And city and nation Embodied
01:05:40 -  Demonstrating that there's a God Who has set men free By the freedom which you yourself enjoy
01:05:50 -  And exhibit without license You're not living in fear Intimidation
01:06:00 -  That what about the future What about money What about money
01:06:08 -  Because you're people who believe God in their work Who said seek first the kingdom of God And his righteousness
01:06:18 -  And all things will be added unto you So this precious rabbi with whom we met yesterday and today Born in Buenos Aires
01:06:38 -  Lived his entire life in Latin America Who are you he said What are you about
01:06:46 -  Why are you here in Monterrey Well I said for the same reason that I was in Singapore Related to Indonesia
01:06:52 -  Holland, Germany and Israel Holland, Germany and Israel Holland, Germany and Israel
01:06:58 -  Holland, Germany and Israel For the same reason that I was in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore Holland, Germany and Israel
01:07:04 -  And going to Africa And all over the world I'm serving the God of my fathers
01:07:12 -  And I'm the author of several books Traveling widely Serving the lord
01:07:20 -  He said What is your organization Your movement
01:07:28 -  How you're paying for this Who pays the bill I said seek first the kingdom of God
01:07:36 -  And his righteousness And all things will be added unto you We are not limited by the Mexican economy
01:07:58 -  We are not affected by What are the natural resources of our nation God is not limited
01:08:10 -  By the earth which he himself has made He has seen to it That certain areas would be impoverished
01:08:22 -  That if there is a people in the midst of those areas That are enjoying prosperity It's not to be attributed to the accident of resources
01:08:32 -  Or the skill of their manpower But to their faith in God Who will give all things
01:08:42 -  To those who seek first The kingdom of heaven And his righteousness
01:08:58 -  So let me conclude for tonight And ask you a question It is the question
01:09:10 -  What is first for you Your own self interest Your health
01:09:16 -  How you're feeling Your son, your children, your family These are legitimate natural concerns
01:09:24 -  But they're not your first concerns When you make them your first concern You're substituting an idol against God
01:09:36 -  Seek first the kingdom And the king And his purpose
01:09:44 -  Which is other than your own And according to what we have read in the Bible Which is other than your own
01:09:54 -  And according to what we have read in Ephesians Has no benefit for the world at all A demonstration
01:10:04 -  Through the church Of the wisdom of God Against the principalities and powers of the earth
01:10:14 -  As Paul says Is the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus So God has sent me
01:10:22 -  All the way to you Where others have rejected And are unwilling to receive it
01:10:34 -  To put this question to you The church that is the church That will fulfill the
01:10:46 -  Eternal purposes of God And have a distinguished inheritance And eternal reward
01:10:58 -  Because they will suffer If they put the interest of God first The powers of the air will take notice
01:11:10 -  And they will begin to fear And oppose you Who up till now have not bothered you
01:11:16 -  Because they say Jesus we know and Paul we know But the church in Monterrey
01:11:24 -  Buenos Aires So long as the church Lives for itself
01:11:34 -  In its own self interest In its own benefits In its own enjoyment
01:11:40 -  The powers of the air Yorn in our faces We constitute for them
01:11:48 -  No threat But a people who will determine The first purpose for our being
01:12:02 -  Is the fulfillment of the purpose of God The eternal purpose Which is established in Jesus Christ
01:12:12 -  Is creating all things So that through the church The manifold wisdom of God
01:12:18 -  Might be demonstrated To the princes and powers of the air Whatever that cost
01:12:28 -  Whatever that means However much it's against our own self interest However much it opens us up to a new opposition
01:12:40 -  A new kind of persecution We will be willing And not only willing
01:12:48 -  We count it privilege And rejoice with the honor Of the call
01:12:56 -  Whatever the cost When the powers see a people like that Who are not just resigned to their fate
01:13:08 -  Well I guess we have to God called us but I'm not enjoying this When they see a rejoicing
01:13:18 -  For the privilege of God And high calling of God and Christ Jesus By a people who are willing to bear
01:13:28 -  The opposition that has always come To those who make God first They will tremble
01:13:38 -  They will break They will lift up And they will be able to break
01:13:44 -  Those powers Those that have been dominating They will be able to release the captives
01:13:50 -  So that your message of the gospel Will find open ears And open minds and hearings
01:13:56 -  Because you have fought the spiritual battle And have looted the captives By your own spiritual warfare
01:14:04 -  In wrestling Against the powers of your own locality And free the captives
01:14:12 -  By the demonstration of the freedom That you enjoy And by which you are freely choosing
01:14:20 -  To put God and his purposes first That if there's not a Jew for miles around You still take it to heart
01:14:34 -  That we have a mandate to move them to hell They may not be here now But they will be here soon
01:14:44 -  And at that day May they see through us The foolish
01:14:52 -  The uneducated The poor The glory of their God
01:14:58 -  The uneducated The poor The glory of their God
01:15:06 -  Radiating out of gentile faces Who know him and love him So you need to be prayed for
01:15:28 -  What a call What a mandate Who can even understand this in one hearing
