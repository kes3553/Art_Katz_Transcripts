The Three Wise Men

00:00 -  The world itself is not worthy. As we say in Brooklyn, if only my mother could see me now. And in fact, she is seeing me now.
00:19 -  Because she is in the air with the invisible cloud of witnesses. Do you believe that? She was saved ten days before her death.
00:48 -  After 40 years of obstinate opposition to her believing son. Because I was a great personal disappointment to her. Because Jewish mothers like to say, my son the doctor, my son the lawyer.
01:18 -  Not my son the evangelist. But nevertheless, because she was prayed for all over the world for 40 years. Ten days before her death.
01:39 -  At the age of 96, she followed me in a prayer to receive Jesus. And so unaccustomed to speaking that name. That her next prayer was, God if I've done anything wrong, please forgive me.
02:11 -  But it was too late. The damage was done. She got saved.
02:20 -  For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. You know what she said the next day? She said the way is narrow.
02:36 -  What about the others? And the day after that? She said, if you only knew how much God loves you.
02:49 -  She gave ten days of evidence of having passed from death to life. She's over us tonight in that cloud of witnesses. Enjoying what she is seeing.
03:11 -  And blessing us together. Okay. So I want to share with you something the Lord has quickened for me today.
03:30 -  From Matthew chapter 2. Which was part of my devotional reading. And not part of the theme that I thought I would be addressing in these days.
03:50 -  It's about the visit of the three wise men from the east. Who came to Jerusalem. Following a star.
04:07 -  And in verse 2 saying. To Herod the king. Where is he that is born king of the Jews?
04:19 -  For we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. And when Herod the king heard these things. He was troubled.
04:32 -  And all Jerusalem with him. This is what arrested my attention this morning. Have you ever been arrested by the text?
04:58 -  I like this better. The next time I'll be in your lap. So I'm asking you a question.
05:13 -  Have you ever been arrested by the text? A familiar text. One you've read many times.
05:27 -  And read through without stopping. Because your reading is religious. And not spiritual.
05:41 -  You're reading so many chapters. Your religious obligation. You can boast how many chapters you read.
05:53 -  But did you really read it? Were you stopped by it? Were you confronted?
06:03 -  Did you think it unusual? Listen to this again. When the king heard from these wise men who were not even Jews.
06:17 -  That they had seen a sign. That a king had been born. He was troubled.
06:29 -  And all Jerusalem with him. Troubled? Shouldn't they have been excited?
06:38 -  Rejoicing? Why troubled? So I looked it up in other versions of other Bibles.
06:48 -  We should have other versions of other Bibles. You have only one? Ask the Lord for another.
06:58 -  Another version, another expression. That you can compare. And in my other Bibles.
07:07 -  It says not only troubled but frightened. And one says terrified. That raises a question.
07:21 -  What could the birth of the Christ child mean? That it would frighten or trouble or terrify a king? And not only he, but all Jerusalem with him.
07:42 -  Why should there be frightened or troubled or terrified? Of the very advent for which they were waiting. That deserves our examination.
07:59 -  Because we know that every word is inspired by God. Adventitious position in life. Which is true.
08:15 -  Because this king is the king of kings. And there's no other room for competing kingdoms. Even when he appears as a child.
08:34 -  He constitutes a threat. That will terrify men. In proportion as they have kingdoms to defend.
08:44 -  Let that sink in. And all Jerusalem with him. They were themselves not the king.
08:59 -  They were themselves not the king. But they shared the same vested interests. They were in it together.
09:09 -  But they were sharing the same vested interests. They were in it with him. Enjoying the benefits of his false rule.
09:26 -  Sharing in the profits of its corruption. In the system in which they identified together. Therefore all Jerusalem was troubled.
09:47 -  If this is what happened in his first advent coming as a child. That will set in motion the murder of his entire generation in Bethlehem. What will his second coming mean?
10:14 -  As king. I'm showing you how to read the scriptures. And draw out these questions.
10:35 -  And these implications. And turn them over in your mind. And weigh them up in your heart.
10:45 -  What is it about the kingdoms of men? That are terrified by the advent of this child. Then and now.
11:01 -  So don't become taken up with Herod. Or whatever the equivalent is today. Because nothing has changed.
11:18 -  A little difference in language and culture. But the realities are the same. Universal and unchanging.
11:32 -  That's why the Bible is more than a piece of history. It's full of instruction. Appropriate for now.
12:07 -  It's interesting to compare Herod with Joseph. You just happen to glance back into chapter one. Who is described in verse 19 as being a righteous man.
12:33 -  And he was unwilling to put his wife away. When he found out that she was pregnant. And did not yet understand why.
12:51 -  But being a righteous man. He was unwilling to expose her to public disgrace. And planned to dismiss her quietly.
13:03 -  But he had no sooner come to this decision. Than an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. And said Joseph son of David.
13:17 -  Don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. And she will bear a son.
13:31 -  And you are to name him Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins. Do you know that that's what the name Jesus means?
13:43 -  In Hebrew, Yeshua. From the word to save. And the JE, Yeshua.
13:53 -  Is from Jehovah. Jehovah saves. God saves.
14:00 -  Is the actual name of Jesus. And the angel said that's what you shall name him. Because all this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet.
14:19 -  So when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. Do we have plenty of time tonight? We don't have to rush.
14:37 -  We can linger over this text. And draw it out at leisure. Well, on these things.
14:47 -  Because the contrast is remarkable. Between Joseph and Herod over the same issue. The birth of a son.
15:02 -  The birth of a son. The birth of a son. The birth of a son.
15:13 -  And I feel like saying in the liberty of the Lord. They represent the only two choices. Either we will be righteous with Joseph.
15:29 -  Or we will be wicked with Herod. And nothing in between. Because that's the nature of something of reality when Jesus comes.
15:43 -  Even as a child. The very reality that he is requires one thing or the other. You'll either be troubled that he's coming or rejoice.
16:06 -  He's a righteous man. He's a righteous man. And he did what the angel of the Lord commanded him.
16:18 -  He took Mary for his wife. And withheld any kind of intimate relations with her. Till the birth of Jesus.
16:30 -  And when the son came. He named him Jesus. Why?
16:37 -  Because the angel said. You shall call him Jesus. Because his name is important.
16:46 -  His name says something. It's what he has been birthed to perform. So it's not for you to choose some alternative.
17:00 -  Or name him after a dead relative. Or some name of which you are fond. The angel spoke.
17:11 -  Joseph did it. He was a righteous man. And he was the son of David.
17:31 -  It says that he had a dream in his... And when he awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. May that be true for us.
17:48 -  To any degree that we are asleep. We need to be wakened. In order to be obedient.
17:58 -  That we might also be the sons of David. And obey the angel of the Lord. Because every step of this is necessary.
18:08 -  And no obedience can be omitted. And if you follow the text, there's dream after dream after dream. Joseph dreamed.
18:25 -  Take the child and go to sleep. Joseph dreamed. Take the child and go to Egypt.
18:33 -  For there are those who want to kill him. Being in Egypt, Joseph dreamed. And the angel said,
18:44 -  Bring my son out of Egypt. Those who have sought to kill him have died. Remarkable to be led by dreams.
18:58 -  But what does that mean? A dream does not automatically bring an obedience. Because you can always say,
19:11 -  Was it God? Or was it last night's tacos? Was it indigestion?
19:23 -  Because the angel said, Take him to Egypt until I shall require his return.
19:32 -  Well, how long will that be? How convenient will that delay be? I may not mind Egypt for a short time,
19:42 -  but God didn't say how long. So you can always avoid an obedience by saying, It was only a dream.
19:59 -  It's a dream that makes a requirement of me that I'm not willing to perform. I can attribute it to tacos,
20:11 -  and not to the angel of the Lord. But he was a righteous man and chose to interpret the dream
20:23 -  not as indigestion, but as coming from the Lord. So he obeyed every dream that he received.
20:36 -  Precious man that he is. And great contrast to Herod. And what shall we say of the three wise men?
20:54 -  What an embarrassment for Israel. That three men who are not even Jews are more excited about the advent of Israel's king
21:07 -  than Israel itself. Jerusalem was troubled. Terrified.
21:23 -  But three gentile men who are wise are willing for the inconvenience of following a star. And when the star stopped over the house where the baby was,
21:42 -  they rejoiced. I can't find it. Here.
21:53 -  They rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Verse 10. What a statement of the low spiritual condition
22:07 -  of the people of Israel. That the same thing that troubled and frightened them was the very same thing that made
22:22 -  gentile, wise men rejoice. So was it then? So is it now.
22:34 -  Are you rejoicing for the babe? Are you wise? Are you detached from Herod,
22:43 -  his kingdom and his system? Not that you're getting rich by it. But you may have the ambition
22:56 -  so to become rich. So our hearts are revealed by our response to the babe.
23:19 -  Either to rejoice or to be terrified. Then or now. And far from seeking
23:30 -  the wealth and riches and benefit of Herod's kingdom, the wise men when they found the babe
23:40 -  gave of their treasure. They didn't come to benefit themselves. They said, where is the king
23:48 -  that we might worship him? That's more than singing choruses. That's opening your treasury
24:02 -  and giving the best of what you have. That's giving the best of what you have. Not in miserly proportions,
24:16 -  but extravagantly as for the king. You got any gold?
24:30 -  They gave gold and frankincense and what was the third spice? Myrrh.
24:38 -  Full of symbolic significance. That you have never contemplated. You have never contemplated.
24:50 -  But you're going to contemplate it now. Because everything that we're reading is not just a mere description
25:00 -  of what happened in history. It's loaded with symbolic meaning and context
25:10 -  and instruction that you might grow thereby and become larger in the faith
25:20 -  and the knowledge of God and His way. Because that actually is gold.
25:26 -  What do you mean, brother? Gold is the symbol of deity. And you'll have it in your treasury
25:38 -  in proportion as you have Him. And your increase in the knowledge of God and His way.
25:56 -  And the knowledge of Him is pure gold. That's what you're getting tonight from me.
26:08 -  The best treasure that I have is the knowledge I've accumulated and the understanding
26:16 -  and the communion and the relationship with the living God.
26:22 -  Have you got gold to give? Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
26:36 -  You know what the remarkable thing is? It has nothing to do with where we were born, how educated we are,
26:46 -  what advantages we had in life. Brother, I didn't go to a university. I'm not trained in any profession.
26:56 -  I'm not a businessman. It does not matter at all. This gold has nothing to do
27:04 -  with natural circumstances. This gold is in proportion to the relationship you have with the living God.
27:22 -  The measure of devotion you've given to Him, the getting up early to seek Him, the acts of obedience to obey Him,
27:36 -  increases your wealth in the knowledge of the Lord and the proportion of the reality
27:44 -  He constitutes in your life. That's the treasure available to every saint.
27:54 -  And we each one have it. We each one have it in proportion to our investment.
28:16 -  Praise God for the wisest men. They didn't come to gain. They came to give.
28:30 -  We came to worship the child. God forbid that that should be reduced to cheap choruses
28:40 -  that only require singing. That's not worship in itself. Worship is giving of your treasure,
28:54 -  of your life and your substance for Him alone who deserves it. And who in fact has given it to you,
29:06 -  which can also be expressed with your songs. But our songs are not a substitute
29:14 -  for our treasure. Only the expression of it. You're understanding me.
29:32 -  Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Sometimes I need you to
29:42 -  finish the idea so I can translate it. So King Herod asked of his scribes
30:10 -  and of his religious priests. Where is the child that these wise men are seeking?
30:24 -  Where does scripture say he is to be found? And they told him, Bethlehem in the land of Judah
30:36 -  for out of thee, Bethlehem the least of all the cities of Judah shall he come forth unto me
30:48 -  whose goings forth are from old and from everlasting. It's not in the text.
30:56 -  Just follow me. Whose goings forth are from old and everlasting
31:02 -  and is to rule the people of Israel. This son is born
31:10 -  to rule. The issue of Jesus is the issue of government.
31:20 -  For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government
31:28 -  shall be upon his shoulder. Now your time, your money, your life
31:38 -  your future where you're going to go what you're going to do
31:44 -  who you're going to marry and what you're going to invest who makes those decisions
31:54 -  the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. It's not for you to determine
32:04 -  or any man your government needs to be on his shoulder. He's born to rule
32:14 -  over all Israel even the Israel of God which you yourself are. And that's why they sought to kill him.
32:30 -  And that's why they will seek now again to prevent this Jesus this son of David
32:42 -  to be seated upon the throne of David in the holy hill of Zion in the city of Jerusalem
32:52 -  that the Lord might go forth out of Zion and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. Now listen you dear saints
33:02 -  listen this is the hard part the issue of Jesus
33:10 -  and the issue of the nation Israel today and of that nation's
33:16 -  restoration to God is the issue of the coming of the King
33:24 -  and his kingdom and that's why every power of darkness
33:32 -  that operated through Herod 2,000 years ago to kill all of the boys in Bethlehem
33:40 -  up to a certain age is the same power now that will seek to prevent
33:50 -  the King from coming will seek to prevent the King from taking his throne
33:58 -  and from this people to be restored to him that he might rule over all Israel
34:04 -  that his kingdom might come Now we Christians are guilty
34:14 -  of thinking that the kingdom is something internal subjective and personal
34:22 -  we are guilty of thinking that the kingdom is only something internal something that can only be within us
34:30 -  and we don't understand what the kingdom of God is within you as if that's the whole statement
34:40 -  about the kingdom but I'm pleading with you tonight to understand something
34:48 -  absolutely foundational or we cannot understand the subject of Israel in the last days
35:00 -  the kingdom of God is actual political rule
35:08 -  of God over his entire creation so much so that when it comes
35:16 -  men will turn their swords into plowshares and their spears they'll study war no more
35:24 -  there'll be no more conflict between nations because the King who has come
35:32 -  will arbitrate between nations in justice and in equity the coming of Jesus
35:42 -  is not to establish our escape the coming of Jesus is not to establish our escape
35:52 -  the coming of Jesus is to establish his kingdom in the place where the wisdom of God
36:00 -  has prescribed I have set my son on the holy hill of Zion
36:08 -  Zion and have given him the nations for his inheritance
36:18 -  kiss the son lest he be angry with you kiss the son lest he be angry with you I can't think of any single
36:36 -  statement more important for your Christian understanding and one that will wake you from your sleep
36:50 -  is that the issue of our faith is the issue of the kingdom it was God's intention from the first
37:02 -  and it shall be established at the end so that there may be justice and this may grow in the earth
37:12 -  when the King rules as the son of David upon the holy hill of Zion
37:20 -  in the city of Jerusalem in the land of Israel the actual, literal, geographical place
37:32 -  and the conflict of the last days in which we shall be involved and be opposed by the powers of darkness
37:44 -  is as much to prevent that reality at the end of the age as they sought in the beginning
37:54 -  by the destruction of all of the children of Bethlehem because Herod is a murderer and a liar
38:06 -  and he is troubled by a true king and in order to avoid
38:16 -  and he lost to himself he was willing to do what the Pharaoh did and destroy all of the boy male infants
38:30 -  so that there would be no prospect of that child surviving and taking his rightful place
38:38 -  on the throne of David because Herod is a usurper and a political appointment by Rome
38:50 -  he's not a true king he's a political adventurer full of ambition
39:02 -  and all of Jerusalem with him and nothing has changed as it was then
39:12 -  so will it be again at the end we're called to something very real saints so we need to have treasure
39:32 -  gold first but then frankincense and myrrh frankincense is the ingredient
39:42 -  that went into the anointing oil that's fragrant have you got any?
39:54 -  do you need any? or are you living a Christian life where you can perform
40:02 -  by yourself out of your own ability your own well-meaning intentions
40:10 -  your own intelligence you don't need the anointing and the anointing of God as I need it tonight
40:22 -  to speak to you not out of Jewish cleverness but the anointing of the Most High
40:30 -  in an obedience to speak what was given this morning that has got to do with my rational choice
40:42 -  but you say brother you can afford to miss it it's only a meeting
40:52 -  so it doesn't have to be perfect you can get by and these people will appreciate
41:02 -  any measure that's not a kingdom mentality I'll tell you how a foolish man
41:14 -  like myself thinks tonight and these days together
41:24 -  are once and for all and will never be given again we were not fishing and looking around
41:34 -  for a place to speak this speaking was appointed of God
41:46 -  beginning with this subject I did my duty
42:10 -  my first two nights in Monterrey speaking elsewhere but not with the anticipation
42:20 -  and inward joy that I had in coming here tonight this is why we are here the other was preliminary
42:34 -  this is the chosen appointed people whom God is wanting to instruct and prepare
42:54 -  applause so we have to say with the Apostle Paul who is sufficient for these things
43:12 -  Lord if tonight is more than just a makeshift occasion if this is appointed and known of you
43:24 -  not just in recent times but before the foundation of the earth was laid
43:36 -  you foresaw this night and these days as a work to walk in
43:46 -  and have called me the privilege with my brothers so to perform it
43:52 -  because it is appointed and therefore must be anointed by the unction that comes down
44:02 -  from the throne of heaven the holy anointing oil which is fragrant
44:14 -  and without which we can do nothing nothing of any value as it pertains to the kingdom
44:26 -  more than you know not only is the anointing oil required for me to speak
44:34 -  this required for you to hear but when I came in and saw you
44:44 -  I have to confess university graduate that I am the author of several books
44:54 -  in many languages my heart sank a little because you were not
45:02 -  visibly impressive I did not get the sense of worldly achievement
45:14 -  there may not be another university graduate in the entire audience the thought that came to me
45:24 -  this is a simple people can I succeed with them you know the way you are
45:38 -  your manner of speaking your vocabulary your concepts
45:46 -  Americans have difficulty following you I need a dictionary when they are reading your books so how will you succeed with this people
46:00 -  by the anointing of God not only on the speaking not only the preaching
46:12 -  but listening and the last spice they gave was the myrrh
46:24 -  which has to do with burial it has a kind of fragrance of
46:34 -  it's the rarest of all fragrances the most expensive and most exquisite
46:42 -  of all substances you got any in your treasury to give prolifically
46:52 -  to the king to the child who needs to be honored and worshiped
47:02 -  with gold and frankincense and myrrh have you ever died multiple deaths for the lord
47:18 -  have you ever performed an obedience that required your humiliation have you ever suffered an unbelieving
47:30 -  and drunken husband and yet remained with him no matter how much you
47:42 -  were abused and humiliated because you love the lord who says he hates divorce
47:56 -  wherever you have suffered humiliation misunderstanding rejection
48:04 -  of which I am an expert an expert there
48:10 -  is the place of death and humiliation and being put low
48:20 -  have we any of that spice to give it's the dearest of all and most precious
48:30 -  in his sight when we have it to give because we are willing to be
48:36 -  crucified and buried with him we are willing to bear his reproaches and be misunderstood
48:46 -  by men even of Christian men who say now you are going too far
48:54 -  this is too radical too sacrificial we are invited
49:02 -  continually to death Paul said I die daily there is always some mortifying thing
49:12 -  some requirement some challenge you don't have to look for it
49:18 -  it will find you if you are walking in the way and following after the lord
49:28 -  you will bear his reproaches so may that fragrance fill this house
49:38 -  that you cannot concoct in a laboratory they cannot
49:46 -  manufacture it from chemicals it's the real thing
49:54 -  it's authentic this fragrance is unmistakable this fragrance is unmistakable
50:00 -  to those who bear it in proportion to their suffering for Christ's sake
50:22 -  so may we be a wise congregation so may we be a wise congregation to follow the star and find the child
50:34 -  and give him worship by giving him substance out of a treasure
50:42 -  of things both old and new accumulated in a life of obedience and now following after the lord
50:52 -  because if there is no worship there is no service no true service
51:06 -  or we can manufacture ministries and be busy and do things has no enduring value
51:18 -  if we are not sent ones and performing the appointed things under the anointing of the lord
51:30 -  because our service comes out of our worship and is not an alternative to it in fact true service is a worship
51:46 -  as I trust you are receiving tonight and its fragrance amen
52:10 -  and so Herod said to the wise men if you go and find him and when you have found him let me know
52:22 -  to worship him also Herod's worship is murder not honoring
52:36 -  so he is deceitful and manipulative you go and find him and tell me that I might also worship
52:48 -  what a portrait of the kings of this world who say the right thing
52:56 -  and the religious thing and seem to have the appearance of right intention
53:02 -  that I might worship him but at their heart selfish
53:12 -  ruthless have no real intention of worshiping but killing
53:28 -  good thing that joseph obeyed the angel in the dream arise and take the young child
53:42 -  and his mother and flee into Egypt and be there until I bring you word
53:52 -  for Herod will seek the child to destroy him pick up and go
54:00 -  to a place you would not have desired that may prove inconvenient and your business might therefore be neglected
54:10 -  and languished and where you will even battle maybe even with the language
54:18 -  and no matter the practical consequences you must not stop to see the problems arise
54:24 -  get up and go and take the child until
54:32 -  the word until is very uncertain it may be just a week a month
54:40 -  a year years he is not told
54:48 -  and you know what it is he is a righteous man and he does not need to be told
54:56 -  all he needs is to be commanded to arise and go and take the child until
55:06 -  had he failed in that had he rejected that dream that's too radical a requirement
55:16 -  that can't be God maybe the devil wanted to get us out of the way
55:22 -  Egypt has always been a perilous place for Jews it's always a perilous
55:30 -  place for Jews that can't be God wanting us to go there
55:36 -  but he awoke he took Mary and the child
55:42 -  and he went and he remained until
55:48 -  he had another dream to say it's safe now to return where I've called my son
55:54 -  out of Egypt well you know we're just getting begun
56:06 -  we're just beginning here this is precious this is precious
56:14 -  and inexhaustible rich significant
56:20 -  it enables us to become enlarged in the Lord
56:26 -  and obtain treasure true worship
56:34 -  true service to the King Son of God
56:40 -  Son of David that everything that the prophets have spoken might be fulfilled
56:56 -  tonight or tomorrow find time and go
57:02 -  over chapter 2 for yourself and mark every place where it says
57:10 -  that it was fulfilled according to what was spoken by the prophets
57:22 -  or what God spoke by the prophets it was fulfilled even the suffering
57:32 -  of the slaying of the young boys in Bethlehem
57:44 -  was spoken in the prophet Jeremiah according to verse 17 of chapter 2
57:56 -  then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet saying in Ramah
58:06 -  a voice was heard lamentation weeping great mourning Rachel weeping for her children
58:14 -  and would not be comforted because they are not because Herod
58:20 -  when he found out that the wise men had departed
58:26 -  and had not returned to him to show him the child
58:32 -  he became exceedingly angry infuriated
58:38 -  full of rage and fury and slew all
58:44 -  the children that were in Bethlehem and in all the coast thereof so we mustn't ignore this part
59:00 -  that somehow is part of the original pattern
59:08 -  that with the coming of the king as a child there's a necessary
59:16 -  and furious reaction against him that will not spare
59:22 -  the innocent that violence is going to be expressed
59:32 -  in a way to seek to prevent the coming of this king and that there will be
59:42 -  lamentation and mourning it was then at the first it will be again at the end
59:52 -  there will be a fury poured out that will not be satisfied
59:58 -  without violence and murder and anything that appears to be related
01:00:06 -  to the coming of a king and we need realistically to anticipate that also
01:00:16 -  it says she would not be comforted she would not be comforted but there's a comfort
01:00:26 -  that will come and we need to understand
01:00:34 -  that but there's a consolation that will come
01:00:40 -  and it will be eternal for any measure of sacrifice that we have to bear
01:00:50 -  in the ruthless violence that will come in the last days
01:00:58 -  against the people of God who are seeking the return of their king against the people of Israel
01:01:10 -  who no longer will be terrified by his coming but will say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
01:01:20 -  and upon them will the violence be poured also upon them will the violence be poured also
01:01:30 -  so I'm preparing you for the messages to come a serious time
01:01:40 -  serious requirements for the people of God some of whom
01:01:50 -  will not die in bed of old age who are in this room right now who are in this room right now
01:02:02 -  I'm not expecting to die in bed I'm not expecting to die in bed there's going to be a fury
01:02:10 -  poured out in the last days on all of the sons of David the righteous sons of Joseph
01:02:22 -  who can be led by a dream until and have accumulated treasure of a king
01:02:30 -  they will be marked objects of opposition it will be our privilege to bear it
01:02:44 -  it attends the king's coming and we will have eternal joy when he wipes away every tear
01:03:00 -  and when he comes he brings his rewards and gives to every person according to their labor
01:03:12 -  according to their service according to their worship so let's thank the Lord
01:03:24 -  for the privilege of something more than a mere study
01:03:32 -  the pattern that was given at the first and will be again at the end for the end time people of God
01:03:44 -  who are instructed and are aware and expectant
01:03:52 -  and counted all joy to be called thank you Lord
01:04:02 -  thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord
01:04:12 -  so Lord we thank you for tonight you're the God of beginnings and endings the great Alpha and Omega
01:04:24 -  who alone knows the end from the beginning and given us this beginning because you already know what is yet to be unfolded
01:04:36 -  in the preparation of this people for their participation in the things that pertain to your honor and glory
01:04:48 -  in their identification with the people Israel and the coming of their king and our king
01:04:56 -  even Jesus the Christ the holy one of Israel and the head over the church
01:05:06 -  Lord we bless you we're grateful for the privilege of being called
01:05:14 -  to serious things that conclude the age in a way similar to the way
01:05:24 -  in which it began separate us from Herod and Herod's kingdom
01:05:36 -  from false piety superficial religion tell me where the child is
01:05:44 -  that I might worship him also is deceitful play acting that is deceit
01:05:54 -  characteristic of a Herod whose false religion ends with murder take that out from our hearts Lord
01:06:06 -  in any way that has come in we want to be separated from it from the ambitions of the kingdoms of men
01:06:16 -  and be single light for your kingdom only thank you Lord precious God we give you praise
01:06:26 -  for your blessing for your call for your word
01:06:32 -  for your will receive our gratitude in Jesus name
01:06:38 -  amen
