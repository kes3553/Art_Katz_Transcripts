DVD 28 Authentic Spirituality by Art Katz

00:00 -  We see the beauty of their lives, and their character, and their integrity, and we hear them speak their many languages, and see their intensity, and their passion, and their character, and their nature, and our hearts covet them for the kingdom of God, that they might be an end-time people of God, proclaiming his salvation throughout the earth. This is what I choose. This is what I choose.
00:27 -  This is what I choose. I slipped into the John, and had my Bible, and paper, and pencil, and on the toilet, the Lord gave me an outline on Elijah. I thought, well, I'll speak seven minutes' worth, and then they said, take 15 minutes, and then as I was speaking, up came a note from my co-author now gone on to be with the Lord of Ben Israel.
01:19 -  Take 45 minutes. I thought, oh, praise God, they're recognizing the anointing on this word, and I took 45 minutes. A Jewish son was brought forth out of death, and therefore a great life came into the world. And now we've come to the final hour, the end times, and there's a Jewish son again that God would bring forth out of death.
01:48 -  How many of us have had our hearts to pound with love and fascination for the Jewish faces that are everywhere about us? How we've fallen in love with our bus drivers, and our guides, and our sleep is disturbed at night, and their faces come before us, and we see the beauty of their lives, and their character, and their integrity, and we hear them speak their many languages,
02:11 -  and see their intensity, and their passion, and their character, and their nature, and our hearts covet them for the kingdom of God, that they might be an end time people of God, proclaiming his salvation throughout the earth. How my heart beats to hear my Jewish people cry out, the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God, but they shall not cry it.
02:33 -  Except there be a demonstration of fire from heaven. Keeping Catherine Kuhlmann waiting in the wings. And when she came out and the flash balls popped, and the catchers fell under the power,
02:53 -  where she would reach behind the person being prayed for to touch the catcher, and down went the catcher, and the people were hilarious. It was a carnival, because she came up with the boast, well we've heard about the Holy Spirit, but now I'm going to demonstrate him. And it was an agony for me, this is the first time I have ever publicly confessed this, but I think it's time.
03:19 -  I had to leave. I could not bear to stand four feet away from the ostensible display of power, where bodies were falling left and right in the complete sense, absence of any sense of the presence of God. You want to know what anguish is? It's seeing an external demonstration of power without the intuitive and sensed presence of the living God.
03:46 -  And it was more than I could bear. I yanked my poor wife off the platform before 4,000 people, and she went hysterical. It was enough to be married to a man like me, but to be publicly humiliated before 4,000 without explanation. And she carried on on the sidewalk as we were waiting for a taxi cab, while other Jewish observers observing the condition of my marriage.
04:15 -  This is the message the Lord gave. When I came back after speaking it and sat on the platform, everyone turned their shoulder away. As if I was some pitiful piece of refuse. What did I do to offend? Then I learned that I had taken 45 minutes when the note said take four dash five minutes, and I didn't see the dash.
04:47 -  Well, what can you do? It was my sight then, it's my hearing now. So get what value you can from this enfeebled and aged veteran. But a prophecy did ring out as soon as I sat down. Somebody on the platform cried out, this is the word that I have called you to hear.
05:09 -  Not the sugar candy that has so far been given, but this word. And it went on like that. And it went on like that. I found out later that that exact prophecy was spoken for other places in the auditorium before the audience of 4,000 people. And I don't know what you think of Basilia Schlink and the Evangelical Sisters of Mary. Do you know this movement?
05:30 -  She has recently died. She is an oracle. She was an oracle. She's the 20th century, the 20th century voice for the Lord. Whose great book on repentance, The Secret of the Joy-Filled Life, is one of the great classics of contemporary Christian writing. Some of the sisters from her movement were in that audience, and they said later, this was the word of the Lord.
05:53 -  It's in this book, but the price has just gone up. So because you were late and indifferent, now it's going to cost you more. But it's worth it. If you paid $100 a book, you're not overpaying. It's priceless. And this is my first book, just republished in English. It's available in Hebrew, German, French, Russian.
06:17 -  I don't know how many languages. It's being prepared in Chinese. Of an ideological Jew who had been brought to a place of disillusionment in his 34th year with a broken marriage to a German woman. Doesn't God know how to bring us Jews down? He gives you a wife who had belonged to the Hitler Youth and is schizophrenic.
06:41 -  And in the fury and the intensity of her psychological and emotional condition, how did she ventilate her disturbance? But finding the one place in this stolid piece of rock where I was penetrable, my Jewishness. Is my language too fancy for you? Come up here and be there.
07:05 -  Come up here and be there. I'm elevating the whole level of Christian literacy. And it's long overdue. It's about time you cracked your dictionaries and loved words and their meanings. Where you're just a bunch of pappy, soft touches that affect nothing.
07:33 -  Language. That's our prophetic responsibility to God, to cherish and to employ. And where do you read this language? This is a book written by an atheist. This is not a retrospective book. What is that? Retrospective means when someone looks back and writes something of their memory of it, this is not that.
07:55 -  This is the journal that I carried as a hitchhiking Jewish atheist through Europe, the Middle East, and Israel looking for philosophical answers. And how I was apprehended by the living God. Hodder and Stoughton, which is the most distinguished English publishing company of Great Britain, published one edition of this book in the 1970s.
08:20 -  And I later met the head of the religious books department who approved it. He said, when your book came across my desk, I realized it was the finest literary work I had ever read by a contemporary Christian. And because of its quality, I knew it would not be a commercial success. Nevertheless, I felt an obligation to print it.
08:41 -  You, dear saints, this is not only a stirring book of the mercy of God that pursues a man because he's prayed for by one of his ex-students and her mother. Roly poly middle class Christian woman. But because it's the template and pattern of God's future salvation for the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
09:05 -  Where they, like me, will be uprooted from their places of security and affluence and success in America and all the world and will be again exiled and in flight through the nations. And that's how God apprehended me through the nations. It was the consistent witness of Christians picking me up off the side of the road as I lived for 14 months with what was on my back.
09:32 -  And expressing to me the love, the mercy, the tender concern of God because I was a rabid anti-Christian. And yet I could not easily dismiss this species of mankind that was neither Jewish nor Gentile. They were something else and other.
09:53 -  And because of them, when a New Testament came into my hands for the first time, can you imagine? Can you imagine? Almost 35 years old, a teacher of history skilled and trained in the analysis of documents,
10:07 -  commending to his students to go to the primary source and I had never gone to the source. Either the Old or the New Testament, they were books for the weak. But in the first reading of the New Testament, in the Gospel of John, in one statement out of the mouth of Jesus,
10:25 -  I got zapped and I've not recovered yet. So Lord, let there be a rush on the books and let them serve every purpose for which you have intended them. Because not one of these books have anything to do with my promotion.
10:46 -  I haven't lifted a finger for any one of them. I have had to be pursued by publishers for the Lord himself in his own sovereign way has brought these books out in his time and in the many languages in which they are in print.
11:00 -  It has not to do with human promotion or self-seeking. It's a provision of God in the multiplying ability of God to use media and books to put into the hands of saints those things intended for their edification.
11:20 -  I'm not a man to listen to tapes, but I like a book. I like something where I can read, write, mark, underline and put asterisks. One of these books, Reality, I don't know about the other, it's translated to Hebrew
11:40 -  and they are just distributed for free in Israel. Just to let you know, I was really blessed by this book. I read it in Hebrew and we don't buy it in Israel.
11:50 -  We get them for free. So just to get an idea. You got it for free? You can see me later. He read it in Hebrew.
12:07 -  Ben Israel is also in Hebrew. When I came to the Ukraine and Russia on my last visit, people were stopping me on the streets and plastering my face with kisses.
12:17 -  I found that I had become a culture hero because people's lives were changed by apostolic foundations in Russia, spirit of truth in Russia.
12:26 -  People who had lived under communist bondage for seven decades were freed by these books which were so expansive a statement of the liberty of God in the spirit. So I praise God for books.
12:40 -  Now Lord, thank you for giving me this occasion to dot the I's and cross the T's and add a little afterthought which I ask that you will make foundational for all the church.
12:53 -  And this statement will be demanding of your people. It will stretch them in the hearing. They'll hear conceptual things that are over their heads.
13:02 -  I'm not expecting that they're going to be able to receive and understand this word in this first hearing. But I thank you for the recording equipment
13:12 -  and pray blessing upon it and those who are operating it that later on they can go back and hear again or see again and ponder and reflect upon that which they could not obtain in the first hearing.
13:26 -  Bless this word, Lord. Bless this word, Lord. Bless the spirit of the speaking.
13:33 -  May your voice be heard in this piece of earth and your word go forth that shall not return to you void. We thank and give you the praise in Jesus' name.
13:42 -  God's people said, Amen. Well, I have here a little something that I wrote up at the impulse of the Lord
13:57 -  that began as a statement on what is the context by which God intended the operation of the gifts of the Spirit. Of course, I have had a long and haunting sense
14:11 -  that the charismatic age was somehow not quite the context of God's intention. When men spoke about reviving denominations
14:24 -  or wanted the operation of the gifts of the Spirit to make their meetings more exciting, I knew that this was something other and less than God's intention
14:33 -  and that it deprecated the Spirit of God. It made God a utility for our purposes. And if the Spirit of God is demeaned, what shall we say of God himself?
14:44 -  Maybe the whole absence of the sense of God, the fear of God and the awe of God is not the least of the consequences of our callow, charismatic generation
14:53 -  that was so easy with regard to the Holy Spirit where you could have left out the designation Holy. It became a kind of convenience for men.
15:05 -  But I like the Hebrew, the Ruach HaKodesh, the Spirit of Holiness. So we mustn't traffic in that,
15:16 -  nor must we make merchandise of this Holy thing that God has given for Holy purposes and not the convenience of men nor their religion.
15:26 -  So this outline started as that. But then as it went on, I realized that I was writing something much more. It could almost be considered a summary
15:37 -  of what are the distinguishing and distinctive features of that church which can be called apostolic and apostles. What is the distinct?
15:48 -  What do they need? We're going to be the nexus of God's kingdom that anyone who clutches the skirt of a Jew
15:56 -  knows that he can take us to God. Something drastic has got to afflict them before they can be brought into that ultimate destiny
16:06 -  that God foresaw through Abraham that his seed would bless all the families of the earth. If this is not part of your consideration,
16:16 -  maybe central to all of your consideration, you are outside the apostolic faith. Your Christianity has degenerated into mere culture.
16:30 -  You need to apprehend the end, radically. But I can understand why you have been slow to do it, because it means suffering, trial, difficulty.
16:43 -  If they're going to experience Jacob's trouble, what are we going to experience? If the powers of darkness hate their guts
16:52 -  and want to annihilate the entire race so that there'll be no return to Zion and no King coming of the descendant of David
17:01 -  to sit on from the throne of David and rule over them and the world, how shall we be perceived by those same powers?
17:08 -  Because after all, aren't we in the same commonwealth with them? Haven't you been brought into their covenants and promises and hopes by the blood of Messiah Jesus?
17:15 -  Aren't you grafted into their tree and sucking life up out of their root? Or are you lifeless?
17:23 -  Because unless you're conscious of this remarkable metaphor of being grafted into Israel's tree, how then can you derive the benefit
17:34 -  of the life that flows up through its root? Lost to them who are bereaved from its root, lost to them who are broken off branches,
17:42 -  but you should be bearing their fruit by that sap, the divine life, so as to move them to jealousy.
17:55 -  Lord, I'm still in the first paragraph, but we've got all morning long and we'll even skip lunch
18:05 -  or we'll eat it while art's talking. Are you understanding, dear saints, that I'm not saying any of these things because I'm Jewish?
18:16 -  I didn't know them as a Jew. I'm saying all of these things because I'm God's prophetic statesman,
18:24 -  because he's put these words in my mouth, because he's given me an opportunity to make an insertion this morning
18:31 -  that will justify all of these days together. It will be absolutely foundational for all the future of the church,
18:37 -  and there are not many who can proclaim these kinds of things, and that's how you'll tell the phony from the true.
18:46 -  These conferences, prophecy conferences, and not one mention of Israel in the whole duration of them, that's prophetic,
18:56 -  and it's got to do with fun and games and personal things that they can tell you, your social security number
19:01 -  and your aunt Anna's hangnail, and ba-ba-ba-ba, and someone's got a... And they call that prophetic,
19:08 -  and you run with glee and delight that you might be the one who's called and receive a personal prophecy?
19:15 -  If there's any subject compelling in the heart of God foremost for the consideration of the church who knows nothing about it,
19:25 -  even in their present affinity and disposition toward Israel, that's kindly. It's this subject,
19:31 -  and if it's not proclaimed and set forth by foundational men, how shall it be understood? You'll not get it from your pastors.
19:38 -  After they get it from the prophet, after the ground has been broken, after it's been opened up,
19:45 -  after you have considered Romans 11, and the apostolic genius of what Paul sees that is climaxed by the greatest effulgence of praise
19:55 -  in all scripture, Romans 11, 33, through 36, all the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God,
20:05 -  who has been his counselor, who has given to him, and it shall be given again. Where did God get this?
20:13 -  For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever. You dear disqualified saints,
20:27 -  who have never once reflected on this glorious conclusion of the most significant, massive statement on the mystery of Israel given in all scripture
20:42 -  by the great apostle Paul, which he received by revelation, and of which he enjoins us not to miss this mystery,
20:54 -  lest you become wise in your own conceit and we have missed it. We've not sought it, we've not desired to know it,
21:03 -  and I praise God it's a mystery, one that you're not going to find an explanation through any cerebral activity of your own.
21:12 -  If it doesn't come revealed, it doesn't come. And how shall it be revealed? By some character like me,
21:22 -  who takes 45 minutes instead of four to five minutes, and gets on platforms where men, if they knew better, would never have allowed him,
21:33 -  but they thought he was going to be a Jewish novelty, and cute, but alack and alas, he's turned the house upside down and kept Catherine Coleman waiting.
21:46 -  When you'll hear it from a foundational man, you've heard it. I only wish that I had the luxury of giving you that statement that we have given in the Philippines
21:59 -  and other places in Southeast Asia and all over the world that take four to five days, but you'll be forever changed.
22:08 -  But look it up, ask the Lord, Lord, I need this central component, this key, the centrality of Israel,
22:16 -  not in some sentimental regard as a political entity that needs to succeed, but the national, the intent for the nation
22:26 -  in your theocratic intention to make of them the locus of your world rule. I need to know that because it's not,
22:37 -  it's more than a mere piece of idle curiosity. I need to know it because unless I know it, understand it and apprehended by it,
22:44 -  how shall I be to them what I must in their time of final tribulation where the church is God's exclusive and intended
22:53 -  salvific agency. If any of them survive, it's because of you. But of course, if you're raptured and not available,
23:03 -  what are you going to do? We'll explain to them that the Lord had an escape route for you while they have to suffer in the earth.
23:11 -  There's nothing that more puts the death knell on this noxious novelty called pre-tribulation rapture that has less than a two century history
23:21 -  and began with some hysterical woman called a prophecy than the proper understanding of the issue of Israel in the last days that requires the presence of a church,
23:33 -  of an ultimate kind in the earth, or there be no Jewish survival at all. It's the purpose for your being.
23:46 -  But you'll not be able to fulfill it as a bunch of sappy saints. You'll only be able to fulfill it
23:53 -  as an apostolic and prophetic entity which is why God is pouring out his soul this morning to sink that word into your foundations
24:02 -  even if your mind cannot grasp it. The spirit of the word will go in and will not return to him void.
24:08 -  The church that is the church that is apostolic radically apprehends the end. It is eschatologically minded.
24:18 -  For eschatological means the things pertaining to the end. And it's not afraid that the end is clothed in violence, smoke, judgment, wrath, final dealings of God,
24:32 -  the culmination of the nations and their long opposition to God and your place in it.
24:45 -  And when the powers of darkness see that you understand these things, you are marked for a first time.
24:52 -  Up till now they said, Jesus we know and Paul we know, but the church at Salmon, Idaho, who? Or Timbuktu or wherever you're from, Kansas City, who?
25:00 -  You're of no consequence. We yawn at your profession that you're going to take cities for Christ through praise and worship.
25:08 -  But to God it was so simple and effortless and without sacrifice. And we can do it musically.
25:16 -  Hey listen, we've got all the apparatus and hi-fi and speakers. Well that's how you do it.
25:22 -  Of course that was not available to Paul. So it has to wait for your generation and your technology. The principalities and powers of the year, dear saints,
25:30 -  are the critical subject of the church's consideration of the last days. Mere demon deliverance of an individual kind,
25:39 -  however beneficial and grateful we are for that activity, is only skimming the surface of a much greater subject. The greater subject of the church,
25:50 -  the greater power of the church, the greater power of the church, is skimming the surface of a much greater subject.
25:56 -  The greater subject is not the issue of individual bondage. It's the issue of a ruling angiology that are fallen and have influence
26:07 -  to jerk and manipulate entire nations and races. Oh yeah, Art, where do you see that in history? What do you think Nazism is?
26:16 -  You can't explain Nazism sociologically. It's a spirit phenomenon. And the powers of darkness that fomented it
26:24 -  in the land of Gerda, Shilla, Fichte, and Hegel prevail still in the realm of the air over that nation waiting their next opportunity.
26:34 -  You know what I've observed? Only that believer who has an apprehension of the mystery of Israel has equally with it
26:44 -  an understanding of the mystery of iniquity and of the powers of darkness and knows what it will take to unseat them.
26:51 -  The two things go hand in hand. Well, I'm telling you that if you move in the direction of which you're being encouraged this morning,
27:02 -  you're going to become mocked. The powers of darkness who formerly yawned over your most strenuous activity
27:11 -  that you thought was taking cities now will regard you with a new concern and caution, if not fear, for now you're on the right track
27:20 -  and now you constitute a threat. And because of that, you can expect their opposition. And because of their opposition,
27:30 -  you'll know that you cannot face this press alone and you will need the coordinate strength of the body of Christ who equally recognizes
27:40 -  that they are in a contest of an ultimate kind and need each other's prayer, encouragement, and not to give the enemy any advantage
27:49 -  by speaking those things that are corrective for us which we welcome as being the act of love itself. It makes the church the church.
28:00 -  We have to turn the chairs around and look in each other's faces and confront what needs to be confronted
28:09 -  if God has given us a discernment and a key, a solicitous love that the person knows that you're not nailing them
28:17 -  because we're in something together and we're concerned for the condition of the body altogether. You see, the whole thing becomes tightened up,
28:28 -  the slack goes out, the church becomes the church with a new seriousness and a new depth and quality of prayer
28:36 -  which has never gotten off the ground because true prayer cannot exceed the truth of the relationships of those who are praying.
28:45 -  Prayer like worship is not a technique or a methodology. It's a spiritual statement of the truth of the reality of your life together.
28:58 -  Intercession is a corporate travail by people who are living corporately and are not the aggregate of individualities
29:06 -  that come together for the purposes of a conference. Got the picture? And it all started with the subject Israel?
29:15 -  Here we are into the subject of the church and that's the way God intended it. Because you have neglected the one, you have forfeited the other.
29:24 -  And the powers of darkness are totally unimpressed. Turn up the amplifiers and they'll continue to yawn. So what did I say here?
29:39 -  Such a body is one to be opposed by the powers of darkness as a threat upon whom its vicious spite is to be ventilated. But such a body finds itself in felt disjuncture with the world.
29:54 -  And when you read that these high school grads are given eight and a half million dollars as a bonus to sign a contract
30:03 -  that will earn for them 25 or 52 or some other astronomical amount of millions of dollars for the next ten years as a contract for a baseball player,
30:12 -  you are automatically revolted. You're anguished in your soul. You see in that the demise of all value.
30:20 -  It's a corruption that will pervade all the lump. And you lean back and smile and hey, this kid's made it. He's only 18.
30:29 -  What, do they pay $50,000 for a pitch? The rise and fall of the American empire and the corruption of its values
30:40 -  because there's a church of dum-dums upon whom this has not been registered and will even go along and pay the bill. No moral discernment, no anguish of soul
30:55 -  for the antichrist thing that was already prevailing in our culture. We are not in a felt disjuncture with the world. We are in the world and with the world
31:06 -  and using its promotions, its mentality and all the kinds of things to augment our religion that augment the sales in Walmart.
31:16 -  All you have to do is flood the mailboxes. Oral Roberts knows that. And you'll get a certain percentage back
31:24 -  that will far exceed anything that it cost you to send out that enormous mass mailing and finance everything, even a lifestyle
31:34 -  that you can live as a robber baron and be celebrated as the great hero of faith. You think the powers of the air are impressed with that?
31:44 -  Jesus they know and Paul they know. They know whom to fear, whom to recognize. When they see authenticity,
31:52 -  when they see a fluke, fake, baked food, when they see a fluke, fake, baked counterfeit, success based on the world's model, using manipulation,
32:02 -  they yawn. We need to be so, how shall I say it, sensitive as to not to condescend
32:11 -  to anything in which the world majors. Choosing to be foolish, pilgrims, strangers and sojourners in the earth
32:21 -  rather than we should in any way accommodate them in response to their advertising, to their allures, to their seductions.
32:29 -  We would hate it. Our souls should be chafed like righteous lot
32:36 -  rather than condescend and be in the whole system of merchandising together with everybody else. Paul, when he woke up that morning in Athens
32:48 -  where he had not intended to be in flight from persecution and he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
32:56 -  He was chafed and grieved in his soul. Therefore, confronted he the devout Jews in the synagogue and in the marketplace
33:09 -  where idolatry has its most profound forms. There was a therefore that set Paul on an apostolic journey in Athens
33:21 -  because the spirit within him grieved when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Where's our grief?
33:32 -  The true apostolic church will be grieving. It will be at this juncture with the world. It will not be one of the boys.
33:42 -  It will not embrace a Christianity by which it could think itself Christian at the same time enjoy the acceptance of its neighbors
33:49 -  as being nice guys. You're no longer be fun. You're no longer be invited to the barbecue.
33:55 -  You're too solemn. You're too serious. There's a strange look in your eye as if you see beyond the apparent
34:02 -  and see the things that are ultimate and eternal that makes you unfit to be fun and one of the boys.
34:10 -  You're willing for that? Do you want to be a pilgrim and a stranger? Or you want to be accepted even as a Christian?
34:18 -  First time I ever preached on pilgrim strangers and sojourners I had to leave while the brother threw his passport down on the floor that night.
34:27 -  He had just gotten a visa to go somewhere and he was so convicted that he was so much part of the American landscape.
34:34 -  He threw his American passport on the ground so much as to show where his true identities to be found in heaven.
34:41 -  And the next morning I had to fly out but I was a standby. And I watched all of the passengers
34:46 -  with the tickets getting right on. And I stood by and watched them go by hoping my name would be called.
34:55 -  And people looked at me like you pitiful object. You're not in the flow.
35:03 -  Are you willing to bear that continually? Not just in the world but in Christendom
35:10 -  and in the church where all of a sudden you become too radical not the fun that you used to be even as a Christian.
35:18 -  You have strange preoccupations now. You're even coming you're taken up with the Jews
35:25 -  and you've lost your center which used to be Christ now it's Israel. The kind of thing of which I'm accused.
35:33 -  When actually the fact of the matter is to be taken up with Israel is to be taken up with Christ.
35:39 -  For he is their King and he comes with their restoration. Can you bear misunderstanding?
35:47 -  I'm called now a Christian anti-Semite. Why? Because I'm speaking of a dire
35:55 -  future for present Israel and Jews worldwide. Of course if you loved Israel you wouldn't say things like that. You would make nice.
36:02 -  You would give them comfort now even if it's a false comfort. Well when you get my next newsletter now
36:10 -  being prepared you'll see the announcement of a new correspondence school
36:17 -  for Jewish evangelism called Apocalyptic Evangelism. Looking for Christians who can be schooled to do with Jews what I would do if I had your opportunity.
36:28 -  You'll be able to face them and confront them in ways in which they have never been confronted by speaking to them of the things that pertain to their future
36:38 -  and you're going to alert them and tell them that according to your knowledge of Scripture and prophecy there's a time of Jacob's trouble that's future
36:47 -  of which they need to understand or they will be victim like their Jewish forebears in Germany. Can you do that?
36:57 -  And don't think they're going to sit down and take that nicely without anger, without irritation. How can you say that?
37:03 -  If you wilt easily you're out of the game. If you need their approval you're out of the game.
37:10 -  If you're a soft sap that says I know Jews that are more Christian than Christians you're disqualified.
37:19 -  If you're impressed with the external qualifications and impressiveness of which we Jews are very impressive and don't understand what the Word of God says about
37:29 -  all men everywhere that there's no man good. There's not a righteous soul upon the earth who doeth good and sinneth not.
37:38 -  How much they appear. Good, civil. They don't bark at their wives like as we do.
37:46 -  They have nice awards and are mannerly and cultured and have several university degrees. They don't need your Christ
37:55 -  until you make that need known to them. Jewish evangelism is the ultimate test of the church. And we have wisely avoided it
38:08 -  and let Moish Rosen and the Jews for Jesus do it. Parachurch organizations but we have forfeited the intrinsic call of God
38:18 -  of which Paul says I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ which by the way is the gospel of the kingdom the Davidic kingdom and its coming
38:28 -  for it is the power of God and the salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
38:38 -  That's God's priority saints and we have nicely circumvented that requirement. You know why?
38:47 -  We're cowards because we know Jews are tough because we're intimidated because we barely got through high school
38:54 -  because our English is lacking because we think that they have some superior knowledge and ability. We circumvent them.
39:01 -  We compliment them when we should be challenging them. We have forfeited the priority of the Lord and the powers of darkness know it.
39:09 -  And they say this is a church that we're required to fear when they themselves choose at random
39:16 -  which of God's requirements they will observe and which they will disallow. To miss the issue of the Jew
39:22 -  and the priority of God is to miss God and to bring ourselves of being of no repute before the powers of the air.
39:32 -  As I told the Filipino pastors better that you should be known by the powers of darkness
39:37 -  than you should be esteemed by man. You think that's an easy statement? You know these Filipino pastors
39:45 -  they're up from poverty and now they're finally finding a place of some measure of success
39:52 -  and life and respectability and acceptance and you're saying if you're going to count for God
39:59 -  it would be better if you were feared by the power of darkness than to receive the esteem of men.
40:05 -  And they nod and they say yes that's right Art. I said okay. Now you're not going to be feared
40:11 -  by the powers of darkness unless you first forfeit your desire for the esteem of men.
40:17 -  How many of you will stand and say this day I forfeit. I'm unwilling to consider.
40:24 -  I shall not seek to be acknowledged respected esteemed by men. I choose to be marketed
40:31 -  not been acknowledged by the powers of darkness. Oh I didn't think
40:37 -  I wasn't giving you an invitation. Well okay. Oh you're getting serious you guys.
40:43 -  Praise the Lord. Lord mark this because I know the powers of darkness
40:49 -  are marking it and they're trembling over salmon Idaho
40:55 -  and what has been convened here that is exceeding the intention of those who have established these days.
41:01 -  I would like to turn back to their fellowships in the communities this new resolution
41:07 -  better to be marked by the powers of darkness is one to be feared
41:13 -  than I should enjoy or seek for that seductive acceptance of men. I'd rather be misunderstood
41:19 -  and I will be misunderstood and I'm willing to be a reproach stranger sojourner in this worth
41:25 -  in this earth but to serve the purposes of God that consummate
41:31 -  the glory in your coming for Jesus sake in his name. Amen.
41:37 -  You may be seated. Hey I'm still in the first paragraph. How much more can you take?
41:50 -  So. Okay. Remember he said that
41:59 -  and he's an authority. You know dear saints we are involved in a cosmic drama.
42:07 -  C.O.S.M.I.C. and the awareness of that will break up the provincial
42:15 -  narrow parameters of your present faith and understanding.
42:21 -  Yes you're in a locality God has planted you there but what is being worked
42:27 -  has an ultimate and cosmic significance. It touches the end of the ages.
42:33 -  It brings God who is the creator of the heaven and the earth into his own creation
42:39 -  to establish his rule and to prevail over the rebellious nations.
42:45 -  It ends the powers of darkness that suffered their initial defeat at the cross and experienced
42:51 -  their final defeat and another people who in the body of Christ again suffer their
42:57 -  opposition and bear it with the spirit as their Lord before them. That's why it is given
43:03 -  to the beast to overcome the church. But in being overcome
43:09 -  something is displayed that would not otherwise have been expressed or revealed
43:15 -  the character of God in patient forbearance and suffering unjustly
43:21 -  and with rejoicing knowing that it signals the end of the age
43:27 -  and that those who bear this will give themselves an eternal reward
43:33 -  that shall not corrupt nor rust away a crown. That's eschatological
43:39 -  and I know it's not part of your present thinking and needs to be.
43:45 -  For it's the anticipation of the Lord who comes and brings his rewards
43:51 -  with him to give to every man according to his works that is the greatest incentive
43:57 -  for those works that will pass on to the next generation. I've got works dear saints
44:03 -  I've got to spare but what do you have? I'll tell you something
44:12 -  about the works of God that will not be consumed. He has to be the author of it.
44:18 -  It'll never be comfortable and you're not able to perform it out of your own human
44:24 -  and religious ability. Anything that you can perform is de facto disqualified
44:29 -  as a work of God. Like this morning this speaking
44:35 -  you think you're looking at some virtue also look my no hands
44:41 -  Lord ever ceased in a moment to be the life of my life and the speaking of my speaking
44:47 -  and the wisdom of my wisdom I'd fall flat and shrivel up before you like nothing.
44:53 -  This is a work this morning this isn't a message it's a consequence
44:59 -  for both time and for eternity and when you are engaged in labors of that kind
45:05 -  day and night from country to country you have to say with Paul
45:11 -  who is sufficient for these things. Listen you dear saints you are every one of you
45:17 -  living beneath the glory of God. You are every one of you living on the level
45:23 -  of your human and religious ability so long as you remain
45:29 -  at this level but once you kick in the gear and shift into the apostolic
45:35 -  realm of engagement with the powers of the air and the issue of Israel
45:41 -  and being God's salvific provision for them in their last days extremity
45:47 -  you'll recognize you cannot perform it and that the resurrection
45:53 -  has not been given to us as a doctrine to approve that the picture
46:00 -  you're living beneath the resurrection which means you're living beneath the glory
46:06 -  and your contemporary Christianity even in its so called charismatic Pentecostal
46:12 -  forms has not required it. Put the centerpiece back into the faith Israel
46:18 -  the last days powers of darkness the end cosmic conflict
46:24 -  and you'll have to become prophetic and apostolic which is to say you'll
46:29 -  have to live by God. How else are you going to speak to those bones?
46:34 -  How are you going to speak to the dry bones of Israel that are now in
46:40 -  process of that death when God shall command you just when you don't feel like
46:46 -  it as I have not felt like it in the two times that I have spoken here previously
46:52 -  and often do not feel like it but I'm still yet required to obey.
46:57 -  This morning I feel like it's a real luxury but I can tell you that
47:05 -  when ultimate requirement comes for you you're likely not to feel like it.
47:10 -  Will you be responsive to the command of God when he says send a man speak
47:13 -  to those bones when you can hardly believe yourself that they can live.
47:18 -  Have you a faith to believe for that and that a greater faith that what you speak
47:22 -  is going to bring life to those bones? Yes you, you housewives
47:26 -  and carpenters and ordinary guys. Your speaking is going
47:31 -  to raise that dead? Well you could believe it if I spoke it.
47:36 -  But me or David Hogan but me? Yes unless it comes from
47:41 -  you ordinary so-called saints which is a contradiction in terms.
47:46 -  There's no such thing as an ordinary saint. Your sacramental
47:50 -  personalities your pieces of God imbued divinity in earthen vessels.
47:55 -  Unless you have the prophetic authority and faith to address
48:01 -  those bones that they might live. They'll not live.
48:05 -  And what does Paul say about their living? It'll be life from the dead
48:10 -  for all the world. What shall their return be if they're falling away
48:14 -  has been the blessing of the Gentiles. What shall their return be
48:17 -  but life from the dead. But what is the issue of their return is not them.
48:22 -  They will be inert. I-N-E-R-T. They will be out of it.
48:25 -  They will be dry bones. Helpless. They must be.
48:28 -  Because we Jews are so self-sufficient. The word self is
48:35 -  abomination in God's sight. Never again. What a Jewish proud boast.
48:42 -  Oh yeah? See what you'll get. Never again.
48:47 -  They're going to be dead saints and if they live again it's only because
48:50 -  of the word that will proceed from you corporately of one mind and one heart
48:54 -  and one will when God shall command it. Prophesy to those bones.
48:58 -  If you have the faith to believe for that and they still don't live
49:02 -  though they stand and flesh has come upon them and they still need
49:06 -  the spirit of God and God says prophesy to the wind oh son of man.
49:10 -  The wind is the ruach of God himself. You're going to tell
49:14 -  God what to do. You're going to command him that his spirit
49:18 -  should enter that risen frame. I'm not that presumptuous
49:23 -  on I'm spiritual. I wouldn't dare presume to say to God
49:28 -  commanding his spirit. I'm just Joe Dokes. If you will not
49:33 -  that nation remains in its death. If you're so spiritual
49:38 -  that you cannot transcend your own limitations that have to do with
49:43 -  your image and your spirituality if that's more important to you
49:47 -  than obedience they perish. Oh I tell you I marvel at the faith of God
49:56 -  that he's believing you for this. Lord I believe helped
50:02 -  all my unbelief. Thank you Lord. So it's in this context
50:10 -  in the sense of cosmic drama whose conclusion is felt as imminent
50:16 -  but that word means not eminent imminent is at hand soon to
50:20 -  come to pass. The Lord is at the door. The judge is at the door.
50:23 -  There's a sense of immediacy of urgency of imminence that characterizes
50:28 -  the true church. Don't ask me how long is this going to take.
50:34 -  The issue is not chronology. The issue is expectancy. The early church
50:39 -  two thousand years ago had a greater sense of the imminence of
50:42 -  the coming of the Lord than you. And he's at the door.
50:47 -  So it's not the issue of chronology so much as a spiritual understanding
50:52 -  of expectancy that is called urgent imminent near.
50:57 -  And once you get that what is Walmart? What is the Seattle Mariners?
51:03 -  What is anything? When this looms large the conclusion of the age
51:07 -  and the end of the whole cosmic drama that had its advent
51:10 -  going back to Abraham at the final episodes
51:15 -  devolve upon you. It eclipses all other categories
51:20 -  and minimizes what has formerly held your attention
51:23 -  as being substantial for the powers of the air are masters
51:27 -  of converting those things that are ultimate and making them to be
51:31 -  transient and momentary. And taking the things that are irrelevant
51:37 -  and making them to seem substantial and enduring. It's a whole inversion
51:41 -  of values and you have gone for it. You palpitate
51:45 -  over the things that are ephemeral and passing
51:48 -  and are entirely indifferent and unknowledgeable about that which is eternal.
51:53 -  You have no sense of the immediacy that requires preparation
51:57 -  and brings to the church as only it can bring a high seriousness
52:03 -  that makes the church the church. It's no more
52:07 -  what carpet do we buy or do we have a building program
52:11 -  or do we invite the speaker. Everything now
52:14 -  is fixed in a kind of solemnity
52:17 -  and high seriousness that demands of all the saints
52:20 -  and not just the guy who's on the platform. We're in something together
52:24 -  and the proof of it is that we have even persuaded our kids
52:28 -  who've been going along you know, nicely but their heart
52:33 -  is not really in it and as soon as they begin to feel the sap
52:36 -  of their own adolescence and the awakening of the sexual desires
52:40 -  and see some of the heavily breasted young women
52:43 -  that oh my God they've come into it much earlier than I ever knew
52:47 -  their little interest in going along to services will as quickly
52:51 -  dissipate away. The test of the church that is the church
52:56 -  is that we have persuaded our own children about the truth
52:59 -  of what we are about and it's not merely an adult culture
53:03 -  to which we subscribe because we enjoy it. We're in something together
53:08 -  of an ultimate kind and though the kids don't know the word ultimate
53:11 -  the sense of that reality pervades their souls and they want to be part.
53:18 -  They don't need a youth program they need a church that's apostolic
53:23 -  that's occupied with the ultimate purposes of God
53:32 -  and knows that these issues are urgent because it's an authentic body
53:39 -  an authentic body and a serious threat to the powers of darkness
53:45 -  and such a people that follows do not love their lives
53:48 -  unto death because they live consciously willfully
53:52 -  and sacrificially as being agents of Israel's salvation
53:58 -  whatever the cost. This is conscious and willful
54:03 -  not something inadvertent that falls upon us
54:06 -  and we have to think what do we do we anticipate
54:09 -  what's coming we have gone beyond mere sentimental
54:13 -  identification with present Israel we know that there's a drama
54:16 -  of a much greater significance through which this people must pass in the last days
54:21 -  and they will be staggering down out dirt roads and over these mountains
54:24 -  and hills and passes as the least of these his brethren
54:29 -  because God says I will meet with you in the wilderness
54:32 -  of the nations face to face if you are not that face
54:36 -  dear saints how shall they meet and if they meet you
54:39 -  and they see only religious obligation well I guess
54:42 -  I got through I said so but I sure don't have
54:45 -  a heart for this because what if I'm caught in extending mercy
54:48 -  and taking them into my attic or into my basement
54:51 -  who are stinking in rags the least of these my brethren
54:54 -  when do we see you hungry thirsty and in prison
54:59 -  if you didn't do them do it for the least of these my brethren
55:02 -  even Steven Spielberg will be reduced to the least
55:07 -  and Jerry Levin of Time Warner Corporation and every Jewish hotshot
55:12 -  who's now rolling in the millions with homes here and there
55:15 -  and yachts and boats will find themselves coming down
55:18 -  out of the passes of these mountains and hills
55:21 -  through thorns and thistles with stinking rags on their back
55:24 -  and knocking at your back door you better see in them
55:29 -  the brethren of the Lord you better see in them the Lord
55:33 -  even in their present unsaved condition they'll not be cute
55:36 -  and they're not even going to be grateful they'll be mischievous
55:40 -  and mean even in our best condition we're difficult
55:44 -  what will we be in our worst and how will you react
55:48 -  if we're not grateful for your hospitality and the risk that you're
55:52 -  taking and taking us in if you go sour on us and show your true nature
55:58 -  which was only thinly disguised by amens and hallelujahs
56:02 -  but when it's tested by the Jew shows
56:05 -  that there has not been a depth of the sanctifying
56:08 -  work of God because you do not exhibit the
56:11 -  unconditional love of God you're very conditional you love people
56:14 -  who meet this criteria that criteria you don't give
56:17 -  your mercy to anyone except they deserve it but where do we come
56:23 -  to a place where these Jews who have always
56:26 -  tested the church that has failed will not fail
56:29 -  in this test and when they come to us they're not going to see
56:33 -  a grim face of religious obligation or worse
56:37 -  they're going to see the gracious features of God they're going to see
56:43 -  an unconditional love and acceptance even though they constitute
56:46 -  to us a threat and a peril for our lives we still will welcome them
56:50 -  and count it all privilege no matter what it costs us we know there's an eternal reward
56:55 -  we're privileged to have part in their final redemption they've never met
56:59 -  a people like that you'll move them to jealousy but are you in that condition now?
57:05 -  and how will you obtain it? in the church that is the church
57:11 -  when we turn the seats around and look in each other's faces and go from glory to glory
57:17 -  beholding in each other's faces the glory of God and have to deal now
57:21 -  with our distemper our ugliness and bad humor
57:24 -  and irritation at the loss of our privacy when you dared come in
57:29 -  with our first calling and my hair was up in curlers and the husband's watching the football game
57:33 -  and feel that your coming is an intrusion on our privacy
57:38 -  instead of the welcome that the early church knew when saints went from house to house
57:44 -  daily breaking bread Israel is going to make you to be the church
57:49 -  at last or you would not have sorted of yourself you would have coveted your privacy
57:55 -  more than the sanctifying work of God you don't want to be bothered you don't want to be dealt with
58:01 -  and you can hide in the obscurity of the pew in successful quote churches
58:07 -  500, 600, 700, 800, 1000 and never be recognized or called upon and go back from having attended
58:13 -  the service into the privacy of your lifestyle unmolested but unchanged
58:19 -  I know what I'm talking about saints we live in a community for 26 years and I was found out in the first week
58:25 -  it's a humiliation to have your wife shout at the top of her lungs
58:31 -  as you're going to the prayer meeting go tell them what a great saint you are slam
58:37 -  and the door whams fall behind you and the shock waves go out to the entire community
58:43 -  and you come into the prayer meeting looking sheepish and spiritual
58:49 -  knowing that everyone has heard your wife's robust cry your wife's robust cry
58:59 -  this is what keeps a true prophet from becoming false only this
59:09 -  if you're going to be a holiday inn white-shoed spectacular
59:19 -  who is the man of faith and power and shows himself and goes back into the privacy of his own retreat
59:25 -  bearing the same difficulties and unresolved perplexities that you struggle with
59:31 -  and you're looking up with such unwrapped admiration because she needs exactly what you need
59:37 -  the kind of commiseration solace, prayer, counsel that God intends for all the church
59:43 -  the shepherds as well as the sheep when the church is the church and has turned its seats around and is facing one another
59:49 -  we in fact are or we will not be for the Jews what we ought and I know you had not the incentive
59:57 -  but if their coming and their restoration if the redeemed of the Lord returning to Zion is the coming of their
01:00:03 -  king and his global rule then it's worth everything even our present suffering
01:00:09 -  and that's what the church is before it's a glory if you think the church is a place of pleasure and enjoyment
01:00:17 -  in its first function there's no greater anguish than the suffering in the church
01:00:23 -  as anyone knows who has been earnest in that relationship that's what makes it authentic
01:00:37 -  because it is conscious of these things and willfully appropriates it knowing that it requires
01:00:43 -  sacrifice it recognizes and accepts a mandate and task
01:00:49 -  that compels it to the radical apprehension of the cross not as a adornment
01:00:57 -  or a piece of architecture or a symbol but the reality that means death
01:01:03 -  especially that death that we have so long postponed of our religious and spiritual
01:01:09 -  self-life that's where self hides itself in its last expression
01:01:15 -  in our spirituality that's where God finds us out
01:01:21 -  in true church the cross and with that finding
01:01:27 -  is also the appropriation of the risen and ascendant Christ's life
01:01:33 -  we become the sons and daughters of the resurrection that's how the Lord the father
01:01:39 -  declared the decree this day and I have given you the throne of David
01:01:45 -  the holy hill of Zion as king and given you the nations and the gentiles
01:01:51 -  as your inheritance this day I have declared the decree which day? the day of Jesus's nativity
01:01:57 -  or the day of his resurrection now art my son you become a son in the day of your resurrection
01:02:05 -  the Lord's waiting for that from many who have not yet yielded up their lives unto death
01:02:13 -  and that's been the theme throughout all these days I'm just suspicious about whether our coming
01:02:19 -  forward is that appropriation the Holy Spirit moment by moment
01:02:31 -  the explicit direction by God who are situations for which our past experience could not have prepared us
01:02:37 -  new and unexpected difficulties tensions
01:02:43 -  conditions that could not have been known how do we move through them
01:02:49 -  except that God in those electric moments when we're at a standstill not knowing this way or that
01:02:55 -  when life and death is hanging on the decision and the movement of the body if we do not hear a prophecy
01:03:01 -  or a tongue and an interpretation that rings out of the congregation not by some self-appointed
01:03:07 -  prophet or prophetess whose carnal as all get out and the Lord says
01:03:13 -  and gives you some tri-penal kind of statement that could not be God speaking but an electric word
01:03:19 -  thus saith the Lord this way and not that the battle is not mine but yours saith the Lord
01:03:25 -  and so when Judah heard that they went down on their faces because they knew that that was the
01:03:31 -  word of the Lord in the mouth of the priest Jehazi El who was known in the congregation
01:03:37 -  and whose character was tested he was not a flake how much of our
01:03:43 -  prophecies are exactly that spoken by presumptuous carnal ill-formed
01:03:49 -  immature saints who want their voices heard or attention directed to themselves
01:03:55 -  and we allow those statements to go by as being God don't think you don't pay a price for
01:04:01 -  that don't think you're not dulled by that cheap acceptance now when the Lord
01:04:07 -  does speak you'll be less disposed to be able to hear him because you have been dulled by the too easy
01:04:13 -  acceptance of anything goes by pastors who are afraid to call into question something
01:04:19 -  that is ostensibly spoken by the spirit for they don't want to offend men because the perpetuation of the
01:04:27 -  church is more important than the glory of God only a jealousy for
01:04:33 -  the glory will give us a capacity to be willing to offend and to be offended
01:04:39 -  and to call into question those dubious things that need to be examined so that we might have
01:04:45 -  in the last days a true word from God in crisis moments that rings with the veracity
01:04:51 -  and the authority of God and out of a tested vessel whose character you know because we know him
01:04:59 -  that's the intention of God for the gifts of the spirit and not the charismatic misuse to which we have put them
01:05:05 -  in our generation if indeed they were ever the real thing the church that is the church covets
01:05:13 -  the Holy Spirit the gifts of the Spirit the operation of the Spirit moment by moment it's the Ruach
01:05:19 -  the Kodesh the Holy Spirit not a convenience for us and it's reflected in our prayer
01:05:26 -  it's reflected in our worship because prayer and worship are the statements of our authenticity
01:05:32 -  of the truth of our corporate life together and when the powers of the air hear that true praise
01:05:38 -  true prayer they are imperiled our church is not the conglomerate
01:05:45 -  of individualities who are independent whose focus is upon themselves who have never been broken
01:05:52 -  but the reality of the body is considered to be the first and foremost purpose for the
01:05:58 -  being of that people your career family job security secondary
01:06:04 -  the first purpose is the church the body the organic reality to which you're called
01:06:10 -  that requires sacrifice pain suffering humiliation to be that reality
01:06:16 -  and when you attain to it you will see it measured and expressed in the truth of your prayer because
01:06:22 -  it will not be your prayer so much that is religious and correct but his prayer being expressed through you
01:06:30 -  and the worship likewise will not be something for our enjoyment as for his blessedness
01:06:36 -  the truth of our worship and the truth of our prayer is the truth of our reality
01:06:42 -  and we can't disguise that by turning up the amplifiers it's this truth of our life together
01:06:58 -  that also gives to the body a discernment to both to recognize and to oppose the powers of darkness
01:07:04 -  because Paul says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the true evil
01:07:10 -  the powers of the air the rulers of this world's darkness but we wrestle
01:07:16 -  but only when there's a we it's not individual virtuosos that are the knights in shining armor
01:07:22 -  it's the we that wrestles where there's no wrestling at all but wrestling is ultimate conflict
01:07:28 -  ultimate combat it's messy you go down in the dirt it's an issue a test of will
01:07:34 -  as well as strength where is the we that wrestles
01:07:42 -  it's the statement of the truth of the body that discerns and opposes those
01:07:48 -  that configurations of powers over their own localities that have bound men for generations
01:07:54 -  and will continue to do so until there rises up in that locality a piece of this apostolic reality
01:08:00 -  that wrestles corporately and together in agonizing prayer
01:08:06 -  and breaks the power because what issues from you is authentic and it's the only thing that the powers of the air
01:08:12 -  are compelled to recognize and you didn't come to it cheaply through suffering through anguish through humiliation
01:08:20 -  through disappointment through disillusionment not only in others but also in yourself
01:08:26 -  and that once a month communion stuff with a little plastic cup and wafer that has long since gone
01:08:32 -  down the drain now it's weekly now it's daily now you can't wait
01:08:38 -  it's more than an emblem and a symbol it's the substance and spirit of the life of God himself that is his very enablement
01:08:44 -  that he might be formed in us to give us the power to fulfill the thing that is beyond our ability
01:08:50 -  and we take it together no longer as a symbol a life giving provision
01:08:58 -  a sacrament and so all of the sacraments become sacramental baptism is no
01:09:04 -  longer getting wet baptism is now a burial that issues in a resurrection unto newness
01:09:10 -  of life it's no longer religious obligation it's a transaction of death unto life sacraments
01:09:16 -  that are made sacramental again holy because they are divine provisions
01:09:22 -  for the church that is the church authority in the body genuinely
01:09:34 -  and authentically submitted to by its members
01:09:40 -  because they recognize the anointing and call of those from God has established as that authority
01:09:46 -  not because of ecclesiastical title or office or credential obtained through a religious
01:09:52 -  process but because the character and the life and the substance of the one who is
01:09:58 -  appointed is evident and recognized and welcomed by all the body as God's provision
01:10:04 -  for its governance we are no longer an opinionated self-willed and
01:10:10 -  autonomous people individuals doing their own thing calling our own shots but a submitted disciplined
01:10:16 -  sacrificial body and our children reflect the truth of it and their willingness
01:10:22 -  to participate we have an apostolic mindset that sees
01:10:28 -  everything in the light of eternity so what so as to consider our present afflictions light and
01:10:34 -  momentary we take our strippings with joy and don't think you'll not be stripped
01:10:40 -  as I have been to come back to the farm and to find out that the guy whom
01:10:46 -  I had entrusted with the property in those three years that we were in the grave and he was
01:10:52 -  the first one back and gave this guy a break and a place to live and paid his child support payments and we
01:10:58 -  acquired seven horses and bridles and leather harnesses to pull equipment because we
01:11:04 -  were anticipating a day when you can either buy or sell without the mark of Christ and the guy calls me up in
01:11:10 -  Chicago I'm about to leave he was a disjointed character and I was warned not to
01:11:18 -  take him in but I always I'm willing to risk for the hope of redemption and now he was about
01:11:24 -  to leave what shall I take he said who came to me with nothing but two pigs and a dog
01:11:30 -  I said well I don't know I thought to myself three and a half three and a half horses
01:11:36 -  each and the brother who was with me said let him take what he thinks is right I said take what you think
01:11:44 -  is right and I came back from the trip all seven horses gone all vehicles gone
01:11:50 -  all tools equipment nuts bolts every item gone the very
01:11:56 -  rope that was used to pull the hay up to the loft forty years before that character appeared he
01:12:02 -  took that also he took even the oak boards upon which the horses stood and urinated and
01:12:08 -  he was helped to empty me out by other believers who never ever thought isn't this guy
01:12:14 -  being excessive spiritual men and
01:12:20 -  I was stripped and something rose up out of the depths of my gut that's called anger
01:12:26 -  and the Lord said ah take your stripping with joy as they did
01:12:32 -  as the saints of old knowing that they had in heaven a much greater recompense
01:12:38 -  knowing in themselves not doctrinally but in themselves that whatever
01:12:44 -  the loss of this earth there's a much greater measure that will be eternal and abiding that enables
01:12:50 -  to take our strippings with joy for nothing more defeats the powers of the air when we do not
01:12:56 -  react humanly to distress and loss but counted all privilege and
01:13:02 -  joy for the glory how do they say it
01:13:10 -  eternal weight of glory because we know in ourselves
01:13:16 -  we have a greater recompense in heaven because we are heavenly
01:13:22 -  minded because we have our citizenship in heaven we're not here as part
01:13:28 -  of the culture and the civilization that is demonic we're here as pilgrims, strangers
01:13:34 -  and sojourners a witness in the earth and to prepare a place of refuge for the flight of
01:13:40 -  God's people Israel in the last days distress particularly if we come from locales that are in
01:13:46 -  the wilderness and out of the beaten paths and away from urban centers dirt roads every time I see it
01:13:52 -  my spirit leaps if you're on one cherish that property
01:14:00 -  I tell you the day is coming when I'll not be the first you but there'll be others distressed knocking on your
01:14:06 -  door and you've anticipated them and can receive them and show them the face of their God
01:14:12 -  with joy for it's not only your goods that will be threatened but your life
01:14:18 -  so this is a whole lifestyle it's the outworking of a decision as having
01:14:24 -  been already consciously chosen and consistently maintained which brings you into a conscious
01:14:30 -  and unbroken continuum with the apostolic and prophetic past and the invisible cloud of witnesses
01:14:36 -  that has preceded it only you could say that art yes because only
01:14:42 -  I know it but you need to know it are you in a conscious
01:14:48 -  and unbroken continuum with all that has preceded you in the history of the faith
01:14:54 -  do you know that even now this morning there's a cloud of invisible witnesses over us
01:15:00 -  who all died having received a good report but did not receive the promise who are not
01:15:06 -  yet complete without us and they're looking upon us and egging us on and prompting us to go on and to fulfill
01:15:12 -  the thing for which they suffered and died and which will require our suffering also do you know that?
01:15:18 -  do you pray for that? Lord I pray that you form a cloud of invisible witnesses over us who have had some part in the history of this
01:15:24 -  locality and know what this drama is about we need their active presence from the other side
01:15:30 -  who thinks like that? apostolically and prophetically minded men
01:15:36 -  they are in an unbroken continuum with the whole treasure of the past
01:15:42 -  we have received the what do you call it when the runners pass on the the
01:15:48 -  and where to bring it to the finish line unless you see that continuity consciously
01:15:54 -  and rejoice for it how shall you run your race? this is not some imaginative thing that I'm plucking out of
01:16:02 -  the air saints this is definitive Christianity but it has been lost to us and therefore
01:16:08 -  we are rendered provincial localized fixed in our little culture and time and have lost
01:16:14 -  the whole cosmic expansiveness of that whole glorious past and its consummation in these
01:16:20 -  last days got the picture? okay I'm going to conclude that is my conclusion
01:16:26 -  you want to have part in this? it's going to cost you and it may well culminate
01:16:36 -  in martyrdom but martyrdom has ever and always been the definitive calling of the church
01:16:42 -  not in the last moment's expiration but in the character of its life continually
01:16:48 -  we live as martyrs that we might die as martyrs what is the last moment
01:16:54 -  is the sum of all the moments that have preceded it I'm living as a martyr and it's a glorious thing
01:17:02 -  it's a freeing thing I want to call you to that only a church of that kind will
01:17:10 -  move Israel to jealousy and they have not seen it in their history it waits for the last days and final
01:17:16 -  demonstration of which you are part or God would not be speaking like this this morning and giving me
01:17:22 -  all this time to do so let's pray so we bless you Lord
01:17:32 -  we love a serious God it's not that you have not a sense of humor
01:17:38 -  how could you have taken us so long without it but you are serious your glory is at issue
01:17:46 -  here your coming and your kingdom in which in your chosenness
01:17:52 -  you have fixed your eye on a place called Zion a hill Lord I'm sure that there are
01:17:58 -  more mountains that it would be impressive and more appropriate for your kingdom the holy
01:18:04 -  hill of Zion in that city of Jerusalem knocked from pillar to post throughout its history with that people
01:18:10 -  Israel stiff-necked apostate fallen mocking rebellious insubordinate
01:18:16 -  blaspheming and you've not given up on them and you're still going to fulfill your
01:18:22 -  promise and your calling that the gifts and callings of God are irrevocable without repentance that
01:18:28 -  you've called them to be a nation of priests and enlightened to the world and they'll be that even though they don't desire it and want to be like all other
01:18:34 -  nations you will still fulfill your word your promise and your call for how are you God
01:18:40 -  if you cannot succeed in fulfilling your word and you're going to do it through the church
01:18:48 -  come on Lord have you looked around lately see how easy manipulated we are
01:18:54 -  we're a bunch of easily manageable manipulable people for excitement
01:19:00 -  you're going to bring us to apostolic and prophetic maturity
01:19:06 -  to a cross that is the cross and not a plastic equivalent thereof to the embrace of suffering
01:19:12 -  as privilege to the consideration of martyrdom as a high and holy calling
01:19:18 -  that we will know in ourselves that we'll have a recompense in heaven that brings us joy
01:19:26 -  when we should be murmuring and complaining about the loss Lord
01:19:32 -  I admire your faith but surely you have deserved it and given your life for it
01:19:40 -  and you will have it to the eternal praise of your glory forever
01:19:46 -  and I bless this church here Lord and I know that much of what you have expressed to me this morning is over their heads
01:19:52 -  or rattles them or confuses them they don't know how to take it in if they can't even
01:19:58 -  perceive how shall they act it? but by the grace of God
01:20:04 -  and I ask that grace Lord the grace of understanding the mercy that enables us to
01:20:10 -  fulfill it because if we are not the receivers of your palpable mercy
01:20:16 -  how shall we extend mercy that they may obtain mercy let mercy not be a technical
01:20:22 -  category a doctrine of mercy but a real mercy of the kind that I have needed this morning
01:20:28 -  to propagate and put these words before this people and what will they need to fulfill them
01:20:34 -  but the very same mercy and that's your specialty and I ask it for them
01:20:40 -  this is a called people this is a select congregation
01:20:46 -  you have brought them out of the nooks and crannies Lord they may have come for the wrong motives nevertheless
01:20:52 -  you'll have your will and I bless them my God let not a syllable fall to the ground
01:20:58 -  let them rush for the books for the tapes let them ponder and reflect let them resolve
01:21:04 -  whatever it takes to be this kind of entity in my locality and in the world
01:21:10 -  in this cosmic drama whatever the sacrifice whatever the opposition of the powers of darkness who recognize my intention
01:21:16 -  yet do I make it don't leave me out don't pass me by
01:21:22 -  don't give me any grounds for eternal regret that I lived an entire Christian life
01:21:28 -  beneath your glory and missed the whole substance and point of my calling I was a get by
01:21:34 -  saint with just those minimum of things that maintain my Christian respectability
01:21:40 -  but certainly not the embrace of anything that threatened my real interests but the day of eternity will find me out
01:21:46 -  and I don't want to look to your coming with fear and dread I want to look to it with joy
01:21:52 -  to receive my God my reward for my labors that were true labors
01:21:58 -  because you appointed them well over my head and beyond my ability but the grace
01:22:04 -  and the life that is in the resurrection was my enablement
01:22:10 -  you didn't leave me an orphan you called me beyond that which I am capable because I know
01:22:16 -  if the Christianity that I'm in is liable to my ability
01:22:22 -  I'm out of the faith it's an apostate Christianity rather than an apostolic
01:22:28 -  that faith which is the faith is beyond any ability in ourselves to fulfill and therefore your life
01:22:34 -  the power that broke the bonds and fetters of death and ascended you on high is our very provision
01:22:40 -  oh we're going to come to that communion table Lord with a new earnestness, a new desire
01:22:46 -  talk about hungering and thirsting for the bread of life that has come down from heaven
01:22:52 -  it will not be for us a little puffy thing or a little cubicle but with a little plastic
01:22:58 -  thing that we can take it alongside each other when we're given the signal we'll rush to your holy table
01:23:04 -  with the enablement my God of the life and the substance and the spirit in that broken bread
01:23:10 -  that we made ourselves be it in our own generation and poured out
01:23:16 -  to the world, to the nations and to your people Israel that's the faith
01:23:22 -  and we say yes to it this morning as if we're hearing it for the first time this is the gospel of the kingdom
01:23:28 -  and when this gospel shall be proclaimed in all the earth then
01:23:34 -  will the end come I don't want you to stand up at this invitation but if in your heart
01:23:40 -  before the most high say Lord what art is describing
01:23:46 -  I can't quite follow it all but I know it's true I want that
01:23:52 -  I want to be part in that I want to be a member in that body
01:23:58 -  and that church that fulfills this destiny that might require of me much
01:24:04 -  in the beginning opposition embarrassment, reproach misunderstanding in the end
01:24:10 -  may be my bodily life but I will count it all privilege for I know that nothing can come
01:24:16 -  to me except to be allowed from above I can walk with great freedom in this
01:24:22 -  life so precious a calling and so great a provision are you settling that in your heart saints
01:24:28 -  are you saying yes Lord that is a true yes oh it's going to cost you
01:24:34 -  you dear precious black brothers and sisters you're going to stand
01:24:40 -  in between your outraged black kinsmen who are after the Jews because they're going to be moved to such
01:24:46 -  a pitch of hatred against the Jews who have exploited them in their ghetto dwellings and
01:24:52 -  have not paid them I don't know how it's going to be and you're going to stand in between and protect
01:24:58 -  your Jewish kinsmen your identification with the Jew in the sons of Israel even in their unbelief
01:25:04 -  is greater than that of your own race there's a special call upon
01:25:10 -  you in the last days for Israel and so every North American Indian and so every
01:25:16 -  race and every despised people whom the world has not regarded will be given a place
01:25:22 -  of special prominence in the purposes of God toward the Jew in the last days your heads will be
01:25:28 -  crowned with glory even though the blood will be coming down your faces
01:25:34 -  because the Hasidic ultra orthodox community in Brooklyn New York is in a black ghetto
01:25:40 -  it's God's provision we are in a North American Indian
01:25:46 -  reservation it's God's provision so bless your saints Lord hear their hearts their yes
01:25:54 -  and require of them that's what that yes means when they get home things are different all of a sudden
01:26:00 -  their books their magazines the things that never before occurred to them all of a sudden
01:26:06 -  look differently even offensive the TV thing is an eyesore it's no more the issue
01:26:12 -  of just controlling the programs it's its removal this is serious we're in something together that requires
01:26:18 -  authentic spirituality consecration devotion morning early risings seeking the Lord
01:26:24 -  dwelling in his word loving the Psalms reading the book of Proverbs and wherever the Lord will take
01:26:30 -  us in our daily journey in times of true devotion by which we learn him
01:26:36 -  and I like him for he's imparting the very substance and spirit of his life into us
01:26:42 -  oh I bless this people Lord let me be for them something this morning and in these days more than just quote
01:26:48 -  an interesting speaker may I be the demonstration of the very reality to which they themselves are called
01:26:56 -  where they will attain it on no other basis than the measure that I have through the appropriation
01:27:02 -  of the cross and death and we might have your life your life is triumphant
01:27:08 -  and we bless you for to you will be all the praise and glory forever and ever as Paul
01:27:14 -  said for of you and to you and through you are all things to whom
01:27:20 -  be glory forever oh the depth of the riches
01:27:26 -  both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God how
01:27:32 -  unsearchable are his judgments and his ways
01:27:38 -  past finding God for who has
01:27:44 -  known the mind of the Lord who has been his counselor
01:27:50 -  who has first given to him and it shall be
01:27:56 -  recompensed to him again for of him
01:28:02 -  you can join me in that and through him
01:28:08 -  and to him are all
01:28:14 -  things to whom be
01:28:20 -  glory forever amen
01:28:30 -  like the apostle Paul the church of the last days that can rightly be called
01:28:36 -  the apostolic has as its center piece this burning jealousy
01:28:42 -  for the glory of God forever and that will save you
01:28:48 -  from every flaky thing that otherwise would have attracted and seduced you
01:28:54 -  be jealous for his glory amen you
01:29:44 -  you
