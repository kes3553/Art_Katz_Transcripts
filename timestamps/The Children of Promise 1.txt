The Children of Promise 1

00:00 -  the most holy text, Romans 9 through 11, that may well be the pivot, the hub, the nub, the nexus, the whole turnstile of the holy scriptures, my God, and the great apostles' perception of the faith, which ought always also to be ours. And we're asking, my God,
00:27 -  a special blessing as we lift our skirts, so to speak, and come in, my God, with our feet, and testing these waters and want to come in more deeply, Lord, even finally waters that are too deep to swim in, beyond our own ability, my God, and that you would bear us up and carry us where
00:45 -  you will by the logic of this divine word in preparation, my God, for our own last day's calling to the church and to this people, Israel. Bless us, my God, in such a way. Thank you for Paul, my God, upon whose heart you registered these truths and had such a vessel so
01:08 -  yielded to you, my God, that it came out in this Holy Ghost expression that has bewildered even Bible commentators throughout the generations, some just relegating it as some kind of confusing parenthesis that somehow is not to be understood and to be passed over.
01:30 -  God forbid, my God, that we should fail in that way also. So we're asking grace, Lord, that you who have given these scriptures will also by the same spirit interpret them to our hearts. And Lord, we're old enough in the faith to know that to whom much is given, much is required. We're asking
01:48 -  much and we're willing to be required of much. Bless us together with that understanding that we pray. We thank you and give you the praise for this beginning of days and this remarkable text in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. So Romans chapter 9, servants and commentators, it's just a bewilderment.
02:13 -  They don't know how it was included and whether it's just a parenthesis that is to be leaked over that the real meat is Romans 1-8 and then the practical outworking is 12-16. But somehow Paul inserted this mystery of Israel in these three chapters. Very few, and I'm one of the few,
02:34 -  believe that everything from 1-8 is preparation for 9-11 and everything that follows out of the logic and the weight of 9-11 is the content of 12-16, the practical outworking, that the very first verse of chapter 12 about making your bodies, therefore I entreat you or
02:59 -  plead with you to make your bodies a living sacrifice, that this 9-11 is not going to be fulfilled short of that kind of ultimate or utter sacrificial living on the part of the saints who take the text seriously. Because the issue of Israel is the issue of the church. The church that
03:22 -  is ignorant of that nation, its destiny and its call cripples itself. I don't have a word for it. I use the word truncated, the truncated gospel, an abbreviated and inadequate, impoverished gospel because it loses the vital dynamic, the mystery of the relationship between the church and Israel.
03:46 -  And that's what Paul takes up. So, interesting that it should all begin with a great cry of which there's no comparison except the cry of Moses who was himself willing also to be blotted
04:06 -  out for the same people. And so it seems also Paul where he says in verse 3 that I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh. What can we deduce from that cry that has a very important application
04:36 -  for today, which is an hour in which there's a two covenant theory going around. What's another name for it? A kind of an understanding that one of two things, either that God is finished with Israel and that we are the inheritors of their promise as the church or God has another covenant
05:00 -  for them. They still are under the Abrahamic covenant that will assure their ultimate salvation, which in a certain sense it really does, and that we need not occupy ourselves with them. We have the new covenant that's intended for the church. They have their own of the old.
05:19 -  What does that do for the church with regard to Israel if you believe that? We're absolved from all obligation or responsibility toward them that somehow magically or supernaturally at the end, God does his independent and sovereign thing without
05:34 -  any regard to the church at all. I think that that's a tragic view because first of all it's not God's way. As we're going to see in these three chapters, the church is the explicit agent chosen of God to obtain the restoration of Israel in the last days. When you see the magnitude of
05:54 -  this and know Israel's historic opposition to the gospel and against Christ and his very anti-Christ spirit, historically and even presently and right to the end that Paul rightly says in Romans 11, they are the enemies of the gospel for your sake. So if that's going to be turned around and turned
06:16 -  around through a church, it raises the great question, a church of what kind? It's a church of an ultimate kind and in fact it's got to be a church that to some significant degree even incorporates Paul's own hot cry. In a word, a church that merely gives clinical condescension
06:38 -  or assent, yes, to the significance of Israel but has not the heart for that people in the way that Paul exhibits it in his cry cannot possibly succeed in being the instrument of God's salvation. I've never before said that or seen that but I'm seeing it now. That's why I enjoy this because I
07:01 -  like to hear what I have to say when I have to say it. That's the beauty of interacting over the word. Now I'm holding here a little booklet undoubtedly out of print by David Barron, one of the great Hebrew Christian biblical commentators
07:20 -  of the 19th century, the late 19th century, who lived in East London I believe and was I believe involved in the White Chapel mission to the Jews a block and a half from my mother's house in the Brady Street buildings where she grew up as a girl and where her grandfather died and whom I had
07:38 -  opportunity to see in 1952 or 53 being in the army in Germany, I came to London. They were still living in the same five-story tenement building that my mother grew up in which has since been demolished and that whole neighborhood that was once a Jewish ghetto is now the location of East
07:57 -  Indians, Africans, Caribbean nationalities and that mission is boarded up and across the street as you may have heard me say is a new Muslim mosque. This great commentator died I think before the turn of the century in the early part of the 20th century
08:22 -  and all of his works, manuscripts and the plates for his books were destroyed in the Nazi bombing of London. So somehow I found this in my collection, Israel's inalienable possessions. If you can get hold of two Jewish writers, Adolf Safir, S-A-P-H-I-R and David Barron, they were both
08:47 -  contemporaries. Barron was the younger of the two and even refers to Safir in here as being a great mentor. They were outstanding commentators on the word. Here's his statement about Paul's hot cry as it pertains to the church.
09:08 -  It is only in this same spirit of a love which never fails and of Christ-like compassion that we too shall be able to persevere in our prayers and in our efforts for the salvation of gainsaying, disobedient Israel. Else we shall soon turn away from them discouraged if not embittered
09:31 -  as has been the case, alas, with some who began well but whose knowledge of this peculiar people has been shallow and whose interest did not rest on the deep enough basis of an intelligent understanding of God's will and purposes and was not impelled by the all constraining love of Christ
09:51 -  which alone can prevail. This is a profound statement, more profound now than it was written because now we have glimpse of what it is that perhaps he himself did not see in that earlier generation, namely that the final drama is Israel's flight in persecution through the nations
10:14 -  as it says in Amos 9, throughout all the nations includes Africa and in fact there's references that are being scattered beyond the river Cush, beyond Ethiopia and so therefore evidently even further south into Africa and who knows what this drama will mean before it's ended and if you say
10:35 -  but why is it necessary to proliferate this people throughout all the nations because not the least of the purposes is not only the sifting of that people but the sifting of the nation or the nations themselves and expressly the church within those nations and if this man is right the church will
10:56 -  fail that test if its relationship to Israel is only clinical or what shall we say religious, mechanical, obligatory. We have got to come to a place of heart attitude of a kind that transcends anything that we presently know even for each other,
11:19 -  let alone for unsaved Jews in the most untoward condition of their life when they will be absolutely rattled, panic-stricken, disheveled and altogether undone. It's a remarkable thing when they have all things together, their comfort, their security, their culture, their homes,
11:43 -  their possessions, their distinction and their honor, they are imperturbable that means they can't be bugged but pull the string and what's the word about the yarn when you unravel it, people who seem to be so well collected will come apart in a way that we cannot now imagine
12:08 -  and I say all I have to say is this, how will we bear it? We're going to be faced with a challenge of the uttermost kind in terms of the depth and the truth of our sanctification and that is not accidental but part of the genius of God's very design
12:26 -  and shows as we will see in Romans 11 the mystery of Israel and the church is that God has so constituted both people that the one without the other cannot succeed in conquering the other in coming to the place of God's intention as it pertains to their millennial and eternal
12:47 -  destiny. We need Israel in the challenge that it represents to us to bring us to a transcendent place of faith, an actuality of a kingdom kind which if they do not see it they remain unsaved. The issue of reward or judgment on the basis of a Matthew 25 response to the least of these,
13:11 -  my brethren, is the issue of eternal reward or judgment. It's not just like getting your knuckles wrapped of boo-boo for having failed to recognize that in the least of these my people was himself but you're consigned to the lake of fire reserved for the devil and his angels. I mean it's the
13:31 -  severest eternal penalty for failing to recognize in the least of these his people himself whereas those who do recognize or at least extend themselves in mercy to that people receive the highest reward, enter the kingdom of heaven that has been prepared for you,
13:51 -  inherit that kingdom and they're called the righteous. Although they say the same thing, when did we see you hungry? When did we see you thirsty? So though they may not have recognized the identification, nevertheless they were in such a spiritual place that they could not allow
14:10 -  a people reduced to that condition to pass through and not to extend to them water, food, clothing, shelter. What makes it all the more remarkable that any mercy extended to Jews at that final antichrist time will suffer the same penalty from the world as was extended to them during the Nazi
14:33 -  time. So for example everyone who took in the Anne Frank family perished with the Anne Frank family except I believe there was one survivor and this for a people who will not commend themselves in their attractiveness puts the premium on the message that we bear to set in motion such a
14:55 -  preparation not only physically but spiritually because even if we were completely prepared physically had places of refuge but received them with a dour expression on our faces or a visible irritation and we're going to be moved to that they're going to be very grating and very
15:13 -  abrasive very demanding and inconsiderate and unthankful where any if there's anything in our flesh that can yet be found and touched anything that can be pressed and triggered they will find it yeah unfailingly which has in fact been the Jewish capacity historically
15:32 -  toward the church and some of the church's greatest saints have been stung and revealed an aspect of their unsanctified self that would never have been shown except for the provocation of Jews can you name names Luther Christostom the church fathers there's a deep
15:58 -  grain of anti-semitic reaction that they did not have a grace to bear this people now the question is how does Paul come to this disposition of heart and spirit how does he have such a compassionate attitude toward them and so great a concern for their
16:19 -  eternal salvation that he's willing himself to be anathema to be cut off from Christ and to lose his own salvation if only they could be saved does he have that because he's Jewish you know some of the you know some of the greatest anti-semites are Jews
16:38 -  ironically it's not because he's Jewish then by what virtue it is Paul's union with Christ and not his Jewishness by birth that explains this compassionate disposition and where can you see that in chapter 9 right from the verse 1
17:01 -  as good exegetes and students of the word where do you see a truth in Christ in Christ yeah in Christ I am telling the truth in Christ where else in the Holy Spirit in the Holy Spirit twice in his very first and initial statement
17:22 -  without a self-conscious design to show anything and that's the beauty of scriptures and that's the beauty of the apostolic man it just comes out of the wash he's making a statement of such a strenuous and ultimate kind that someone would be tempted to dismiss it as a man just speaking out
17:44 -  of his own identification with his own nation and by that means absolve themselves from having to have a heart like that because I'm not Jewish but he shows that the basis for the depth of his compassion is not his natural identification with his people but his union with Christ and
18:04 -  that's got to be our basis also or we miss it and in fact the whole challenge is to compel us to that relationship with Christ that we might not otherwise have earnestly enough thought because as anybody knows who is concerned for this it is no snap to be in Christ in your emotions
18:29 -  and your will even to the point of the willingness to be considered anathema means that you're out of any self-concern even for your eternal destiny and there's no way to come from that one place to the other except by such a process of separation at the cross so whenever you scratch
18:53 -  deeply enough any issue of the faith in the last analysis it's always the issue of the cross but we need to be discerning and recognize that it's implicit right here from the beginning of chapter 9 and if this is true for the apostle it has got to be true for the whole apostolic
19:13 -  people that Israel will meet in the wilderness whether it's Minnesota or Zaire and it'll be in both places they'll be proliferated throughout the world but they've got to see Paul because to see Paul is to see Christ and it's that recognition that brings them into the bond of the covenant
19:35 -  and under the rod of his authority it's in the wilderness that they meet with him face to face Ezekiel 20 from verse 33 okay I am telling the truth in Christ I am not lying who would ever think that the apostle would or could but why does he have to say that because the statement that
20:02 -  follows is so horrendous so elaborate that that the only thing that to which we can equate it is the cry of moses block me out of your book my conscience bearing me witness in the holy spirit how would you like to live like that not just with regard to the jews but in everything my
20:23 -  conscience bearing me witness in the holy spirit in fact if we don't live like that consistently before the advent of the last days probably the jews we're not going to find it in the last day you have a sensitive conscience before God and before man in the holy spirit that means what
20:46 -  it's enough to have a conscience and for how many is conscience seared or don't how does that happen conscience is a mechanism that God has implanted in mankind as a device to keep even unregenerate men away from the evil that will consume them how then do they act despite
21:11 -  conscience what happened to that faculty that's why we can see men in courtrooms paying millions of dollars for the defense of their lives who seem so patently guilty and yet have wide-eyed innocent looks like who me and come even to believe the lie of the innocence
21:30 -  be restored and to be brought back to an original place in God where our consciences are so sensitive a wrong word wrong look or gesture thought at this position of spirit and we feel it we stop immediately there's a check there's an awareness
21:48 -  so as i've said many times and we'll hear it again and again i'm not worried about Israel Israel will take care of itself it's already on its downward course the church and the church of this kind alone whose conscience is confirmed by its witness in the holy spirit
22:09 -  but at that first sentence is a blockbuster and what is he confirming and what's the truth that i have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart this implies that salvation is not an option that it that the rejection of christ has
22:31 -  a grievous consequence and i'm sure he's looking as Jesus did when he wept over druslim to the future of what did that rejection mean which we discussed over this table right to the holocaust okay my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh these are the same brethren who said to Paul that
22:51 -  he's not fit to live and who who vowed neither to eat nor to drink until he was dead you know to have this kind of sensitive and tender regard for people who are out for your life is a remarkable thing but always remember Paul is the foundation of the church it's where God is after you and he's
23:11 -  Paul is the foundation of the church it's where God is after and the whole of his people so my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites now notice the difference between Israelites and Israel because later we're going to read
23:28 -  not all Israel is Israel but all are Israelites can you understand there's a difference one is a physical and generic ethnic description and the other is a spiritual statement not every Israelite is an Israel is the Israel of God but every Israelite is a native-born generic
23:54 -  ethnic jew in Israel and these are yet his brethren according to the flesh to whom belongs to whom belongs the adoption of sons the glory the covenants the giving of the law the temple service and the promises it would take us an hour or two to go through every one of these
24:17 -  distinctives and perhaps we should have maybe we will at another time but maybe this is is helps us to understand the depth of Paul's grief this is not just a people who are missing their salvation but this is a people missing their call this is a people who are acting in
24:41 -  the rejection of christ contrary to every advantage to which God has called them uniquely among all the people on the face of the earth this reference to sons goes back to exodus four and moses said to phil let my people go that my sons may worship me the first reference to sons
25:03 -  is an exodus speaking of Israel as an entire people what a privileged status to call God father in the whole history of the human race that knew nothing but paganisms and idolatries and objects of worship other than God privilege call and the glory
25:25 -  what can we say about that what can you think what instances do you know of in Israel's old testament experience where the glory of God was not just an abstract category but a visual and experienced phenomenon glory that filled the temple where the priest had to
25:45 -  come out they could not minister how about the light by by day and the fire by night that was with them continually for 40 years the visible glory because that pillar of fire came out and up and over the ark of the tabernacle in the holiest place of all God's literal glory
26:06 -  presence glory shekinah and presence are all one in the same thing for us what should we say it's hypothetical it's sentimental it's an illusion to something theoretical but never been actual and for that reason we don't even have a jealousy for the glory of God and we think of the glory
26:28 -  of God as some kind of an abstraction some kind of ephemeral ethereal thing that is not visible or demonstrable but God wants to fill his house with his glory that i mean the smoke will fill the house and probably we can fairly say it's the absence of any sense of God's glory that accounts for
26:52 -  the shallow condition of the church today because the glory also inspires the fear men fell on their faces the lord here is God didn't they know that before they knew it but they didn't know it they didn't know it now as deeply as when that glory is revealed
27:11 -  so to this people was the glory we just have to contemplate why Paul is is knowing such grief what they have turned their back on given such a heritage the covenants the promises the temple service whose are the fathers and from whom is the christ according to the flesh was overall
27:35 -  God blessed forever amen so he goes from temple service the promises the fathers the reference to the patriarchs i mean who who has such a lineage that they have isaac jacob and uh who else is abraham abraham for their fathers what a distinguished lineage that you have
28:00 -  continuum with men of that kind who knew God and walked with God and from whom is the christ Paul can't resist bringing in this last great glory that was Israel's that out of it would come not only the messiah the messiah of Israel but of all mankind
28:19 -  and according to the flesh showing according to jewish flesh who is over all God blessed forever amen anything about that before we shift gears that's that's the uh introduction that's the sounding of the theme that's Paul in his grief and in fact if he did not begin that way i think
28:46 -  it's safe to say nothing else would have followed revelation of mystery is something given by the spirit that's right to whom it can be received those people who don't see this have no sense of this they're they're bewildered God has finished with Israel they they i've i don't even mention
29:08 -  names some of the most prominent internationally known ministers anointed have told me roman's 9 through 11 is a complete mystery i don't understand it and i was at the same brother's poolside pleading with him to understand opening the scriptures and giving what little
29:28 -  insight i have non-compass mentis i spoke sunday at his fellowship and addressed the same theme again he died not knowing and ever having been touched by the grandeur and the glory of this great thing now how is that i think it has to do with a condition of heart toward the jew
29:51 -  and the issue of heart toward the jew the least of his brethren even before their persecution is the issue of the heart toward God i i'm just saying that by faith that anti-semitism show me an anti-semite and i'll show you a hater of God show me a lover of God and i'll show you
30:14 -  a lover of the jew the two are inseparable it's as if God has deposited into the earth and in the midst of the nations a people they are stubborn they're stiff-necked their history with their history with God is an abhorrence they have blasphemed his name we have every natural
30:38 -  and religious reason in fact it's the religious who are most stirred up against them and God makes them the test what do you call that chemical thing where you touch a litmus test of our authentic spirituality and the measure of our love of God
30:56 -  hmm because as Paul even says elsewhere if you love those who love you what you know what is that even the the pharisees can do that but to love the unlovely and the unloveliest of all particularly in their last days extremity and condition is a remarkable test and revelation
31:19 -  of where we are not with regard to the jew but with regard to God Paul as the quintessential apostolic man is a paradigm for the entire church God is calling the church to an apostolic stature an apostolic being and this is one of the deepest
31:38 -  expressions of it and what makes it all the more beautiful and profound is that it's completely unselfconscious it's another man saying now what must i write that 2000 years later the truth will understand what condition it must be and it's just a man being himself with utterly
31:58 -  unselfconsciously that really reveals the depth of this union with christ the man who murdered the jewish believers their principal persecutor if he had not been profoundly transformed would have carried that same animus now not against the church but against his own former
32:18 -  kinsmen he would have retaliated against them in kind in the way that they were against him but we see the whole the transformation of a man and the whole issue i believe of Israel is God's provision for the transformation of the church and that we will not obtain it
32:41 -  independent of Israel i know that there's a sanctification that works continually but the depths of it is reserved for that final relationship with Israel and our conscious willful preparation and anticipation of that relationship you say well what's what would
33:02 -  what if God changes his mind and diverts them away from la porte minnesota well let him let God be God but as far as we're concerned we have every incentive to anticipate and to be prepared and if it should not be employed toward the jews it wasted it will still be a glorious church
33:24 -  still bless the gentiles round about us with the same compassion and mercy as we would have extended to them and beyond that this is our final finishing school for our own eternal destiny to rule and reign with him from heavenly places the rule of God is not bureaucracy
33:47 -  and it's not self-conscious political self-aggrandizement now you listen to me i'm with him and you guys it's ruling and reigning with him in his own character in the meekness of the lamb the rod of iron i think is some kind of a an ironic expression his rule will be absolute
34:10 -  and uncompromising but it will be in the gentleness and the meekness of the land or else we don't rule with him we will be disqualified so i just want to go over david barron's statement again it's just two choice to rush over
34:29 -  it is only in this same spirit of a love which never fails and of christ-like compassion that we too shall be able to persevere in our prayers in our efforts for the salvation of gainsaying disobedient Israel
34:47 -  you can put in parenthesis anything that is appropriate in place of Israel right now your wife your spouse anyone who's now the greatest vexation challenge and difficulty in your present life and the sense is completely the same and it may well be that that's why he
35:14 -  he or she is the greatest present difficulty can you relate to that one as Paul is relating to Israel good point how do we think that this this attitude of heart is going to be obtained how far will God go to attain it it is only in this same spirit of a love which never fails
35:38 -  and of christ-like compassion that we too shall be able to persevere in our prayers and in our efforts for the salvation of gainsaying disobedient Israel i would add unthankful ungrateful vexing irritating you you just you list the active gifts it'll be brought to a boil
36:00 -  and if there's any place where a button can be pushed they'll find it as my dear unnamed spouse has an uncanny ability also to find things that i did not even know i possessed oh the deepest sanctifying work and that's why God is already employing our present spouses and
36:24 -  situations in the body and in the church and in relationship and in our own physical bodies it's as a preparation toward that end so because this is not magically obtained what God is after is so ultimate so beyond what we would be satisfied with spiritually
36:46 -  we're all content essentially with our present condition and even applaud ourselves and yet we're so removed from where we need yet to be because we haven't fully reckoned on the magnitude of the challenge that will come to us which if we miss it it's not to our eternal embarrassment
37:08 -  but it means that they do not see the lord they do not meet with him face to face they meet with a religious people whose smile is feigned and whose patience is short and they move on without having been turned and they do not constitute the redeemed of Israel that returned to zion
37:30 -  the lord remains pent up in heaven the kingdom does not come i mean the whole redemptive conclusion of the age is set back for the want of this one thing so critical is the condition of God's people in the last days centrifugal factors are working to polarize and to radicalize and to bring us
37:55 -  to we allow ourselves to be brought to the one or the other and i've said this countless times apostolic or apostate yes that in the end it'll be the lake of fire or the eternal reward the righteous or the wicked and the dividing and the issue itself that will reveal it is the jew
38:13 -  will the real church as i've uh simon's service in many times please stand up what will reveal the real church is its attitude toward the jewish right it's one thing to think yourself spiritual sing the hams sing the hymns say amen hallelujah but when the fat that's right is in
38:31 -  the fire the rub it's a thing of every cliched expression how do you respond to this people in the hour of the extremity is the statement of where you are in God that's right yeah
38:47 -  so if we're not in this condition we'll turn away from them discouraged if not embittered as has been the case alas with some who began well but whose knowledge of this peculiar people had been shallow now there's an interesting statement that uh
39:07 -  maybe yeah he's talking about people who have failed at this even historically whose knowledge of this peculiar people has been shallow so it behooves us to have the knowledge of their history their destiny their call and we need to know that to them was the covenants the
39:25 -  promises the fathers the glory we need to know the history of their failing we need to know even their judicial blindness that allowed the gentiles to come in through the gospel in the mystery of God knowledge is critical and of course no one is going to have that kind of knowledge or secret
39:45 -  who has not a heart disposed toward God and toward and toward them whose interest did not rest on the deep enough basis of an intelligent understanding of God's will and purposes and we're going to get into that part right now that by election there's an election according to grace and there are things
40:07 -  operating that we need to understand or will have a wrong attitude toward Israel that will be condemning rather than what shall we say or affirming and patient and by the way the revelation of God's dealing with Israel and the issue of election and covenant
40:34 -  and promise is the revelation of God nothing more acutely and accurately reveals God as God than in his relationship to this people now that's pretty true so to miss the history of that relationship and what is spoken of in this future and destiny call is to miss God is to have an
40:58 -  inadequate notion of God which in fact is not God and that's why the issue of the jew and of Israel is critical to the church for its own understanding of God as that relationship alone reveals it it's an intelligent understanding of God's will and purposes and i'm saying now of God himself
41:20 -  and was not impelled by the all-constraining love of christ which alone can prevail any other love will be inadequate sentimental love i think we're going to see that many of those who now exhibit loudly such affection for Israel oh no how they love the jew and how they love Israel can't
41:40 -  run fast enough to attend a conference and to plant the tree they will be the very the very ones when the bottom falls out and this people disappoint them that they'll react with anger there's no fury like a woman gone there's something about betrayal and disappointment
42:01 -  that invokes the deepest kind of hostility and anger and that's exactly what is ahead if they've had a romantic notion of the jew and of Israel they want to pinch the cheek and they think that they're all like david and then they come to Israel and find out these men are fornicators
42:19 -  you can't trust the women in your tour group to your bus driver or to the guide and their morals are putrid and in fact women are actually being sold in Israel now as concubines out of russia and eastern europe and i mean just it's horrendous and it's going
42:39 -  to get worse financial schemes political corruption that the disappointment of the idealistic view that was held by the naive will eventuate in a hatred in what was once only an inadequate shabby and sentimental love the only love that will prevail is the love of God that
42:59 -  cannot be disappointed right that's how much Israel is a hermeneutical key to the entire faith and that's why one brother has written the book that he calls Israelology that the subject of Israel ought to be as distinctly and included in the other branches of theological investigation
43:21 -  like christology theology epilogy and he's claiming that Israelology is the central one and it's not even part of a church's consideration i wrote a little footnote at the bottom of the page can we rule and reign with him as i've
43:38 -  mentioned millennially in any condition less than or other than this and the answer is no this is the overcoming that qualifies for rule and it's obtained in the final redemptive relationship with Israel and can we obtain this condition in any way other than this and the
44:00 -  answer is no and so we're coming to the consummation and these are the vital the dramatic ingredients of the last days but it's interesting how the whole great three chapter dissertation on this mystery begins with
44:18 -  Paul's heart cry it's not a clinical dogmatic theological presentation it's a cry so everything has been rejected from the adoption of sons to the messiah in the rejection of the messiah you can't have these other right distinctions that were given to Israel and miss that to miss
44:42 -  that's to miss them all in fact if they had properly esteemed and maintained and kept the adoption of sons and the priestly service and the covenants and the promises they would have been prepared for the messiah the messiah's coming revealed the the covenantal failure that
45:01 -  had a much longer history can you understand that we talked about this when we talked about the holocaust Israel's rejection of its messiah and the bringing of him to death is not so much the sin in itself as a final statement of a much longer history of apostasy
45:23 -  and alienation from God had his final crystallation crystallization and expression in the rejection of him unto death it was the final statement of what had a much longer history by which they had already turned their back on many of these things how many of you know that
45:43 -  prior to the maccabean revolt in that interim where Israel was under greek and syro-finishian rule that even the priest was so impressed with greek civilization that they changed their hebrew names to greek names and that's why many of the characters in the new testament though
46:02 -  they are jewish have greek names like luke yeah and that that many even surgically removed the evidence of their circumcision because it was considered an embarrassment and a shame because the greeks celebrated the nude body when they ran the olympic races they ran them nude and so
46:27 -  they were so impressed with the glory of greece and the grandeur of its culture and civilization that they forfeited and diminished their own hebraic heritage so there's a whole history of apostasy so that's i think that that great sorrow and unceasing grief is the whole recognition of that
46:52 -  that has had its final expression in the rejection of their own messiah who came out of the fathers and who is over all and God bless forever okay now from verse six on Paul rolls up his sleeves and begins to dig into the great issues that are raised by Israel's rejection of its messiah
47:17 -  how could Israel reject its own promised messiah and deliverer according to its own scriptures has got to be one of the greatest anomalies of history i forgot the the the statement of a dutch theologian hendrik burkoff in his study of history he put his thing is the south i'll get
47:43 -  it for you next time the failure of the jews to recognize and to receive their own expected messiah has got to be the single greatest anomaly contradiction in the history of mankind it's staggering in its proportions but it not only raises the question of Israel's failure
48:02 -  it raises a significant question of God's failure how could God have fit
