Jesus The Pattern Son

00:00 -  My Bible, of course, and two volumes from P.T. Forsythe that you must add to your library. I'm on a single-man mission to reintroduce him to the Church, maybe who have never known a giant of the stature of Karl Barth, because you've never known Karl Barth either.
00:21 -  You ought to. These giants are for us. They are our legacy.
00:26 -  Theology is for the Church, not for theologians. So here's a British genius, spiritual genius, who died in 1928, and most of his writings are at the turn of the century, 1904, 1909, 1918.
00:45 -  He wrote a book about the Great World War as judgment. So he's a remarkable and insightful saint, and I'm surprised that so few have heard of him.
01:01 -  This one is called A Sense of the Holy, but what is considered to be his foremost work is The Person and Place of Jesus Christ. There's a publishing house in Oregon that has taken it to itself, WIPF, W-I-P-F, and
01:19 -  stock publishers in Eugene, Oregon, to republish his works. So we all appreciate Watchman Lee, a formative influence in my life, and we need to be acquainted with other of the giants of God that are given for us for our inheritance.
01:41 -  So Lord, we dedicate this sharing, if we could, if it's meaningful, to this man who has gone on, he may be looking down from the cloud of invisible witnesses today, inwardly rejoicing that someone has stumbled upon him and that his depths of insight that came out of anguish
02:01 -  of soul and wrestling for meaning has not been lost to the church and is perhaps in process of being recovered. We need this dimension.
02:13 -  So Lord, your blessing. We always pray your blessing, but a blessing appropriate to the advancing of something that is in its early formative and embryonic stages, that it might take on weight and cogency
02:30 -  and become a profound, viable element in the understanding of the church that will affect everything. So you see what I have here, Lord, and how I was up with you this morning reviewing,
02:44 -  and I'm asking you again to perform on the spot that remarkable thing of which you're capable as the living God, that synthesis, the drawing from this, the drawing from that, that brings together, my God, your statement.
02:57 -  We're all ears. We thank you, give you praise for a privileged occasion in Jesus' name. Amen.
03:04 -  Well, I want to start with a verse that's haunting me. In Luke chapter 2, the end of the chapter, the first episode in the early life of Jesus as a boy, but in it is already the foreshadowing of the total man.
03:26 -  It's already there embryonically in this first expression. It was always there. Part of the genius of P.T. Forsythe is to speak about the pre-incarnate Christ, the
03:41 -  Christ who was before He was, who was ever and always with the Father in the unbroken continuum of eternity from the beginning and enjoyed that unparalleled fellowship and left it and came down into the earth.
04:00 -  I'd say something like this, if I don't have occasion to quote it, that if we omit the pre-incarnate life of Christ and emphasize only His earthly tenure, we're dealing with a stunted and inadequate...
04:21 -  Was that necessary? Eh? Oh, you're tuned in?
04:28 -  Oh, okay. You may think I'm some kind of prima donna that the conditions must be just right, but I am that way.
04:43 -  I am so aware of every distraction because the word must be inviolate and I don't care what efficacy is obtained by motion of disturbance. It's disturbance that's not worth the advantage.
04:58 -  You need to come to that same kind of jealousy that is with me if you're going to become the church that is the church. The Word, the Word of God.
05:08 -  Hey, we're not listening to a sermon. This is not Art Katz's virtuosity. How interesting.
05:15 -  What a novelty. Jewish believer came through. The Word of God.
05:20 -  Once and for all. Not again, ever again to be expressed this way. Ever.
05:27 -  Once, a once and for all occasion that we almost have to hold our breath as it comes forth, as we draw it out from the heart of God syllable by syllable, word for word. I'll tell you, if you esteem the Word of God like that, you'll be transformed.
05:44 -  We have reduced the value of the Word of God. It has lost its apostolic and prophetic quality because we're not expecting to hear words of that kind.
05:56 -  What we're expecting is human words about the Bible from Scripture that is commendable and interesting and to which we can say amen. Well, that will leave you stunted and malnourished, but the Word of God that performs the work
06:14 -  that is sent requires that anticipation. Faith is anticipation. To believe that, that it's going to come out of an earthen vessel with a Brooklyn, New
06:25 -  York accent, can it be? Surely, if it's the Word of God, it's got to come out of an echo chamber. Thus saith the Lord.
06:33 -  And if it doesn't, then we just discard it as being human, you silly saps. No wonder you're in the condition that you're in. So the Word of God must be exalted, because the Word of God is God, and it's sent, and
06:49 -  it's appointed. This isn't Art rummaging around through his briefcase trying to find something to fill out the days.
06:57 -  Appointed an ordained word for this very moment in time that will not come again. Oh, you'll speak it again elsewhere, but not like this. Then there'll be another speaking appropriate there.
07:10 -  So it requires a reverence and esteem. Well, look at this little thing tacked on at the end of chapter 2 of Luke. And while I'm in the mood and speaking this way to give you a gentle spanking, you need
07:28 -  to read every episode of Jesus, every event, everything that he says and does, not just as being something that took place then, and how interesting to see it historically in what was said and done, but though it was that, spoken and performed in time, it is
07:49 -  intended for us upon whom the ends of the age have come. And the intention of the Father, the words that he gave Jesus to speak, and the deeds that he gave him to perform, were in the divine mind, intended not only for that moment,
08:06 -  but all moments, and especially the last moments. So you've got to bring to your reading this kind of perspective. You're not just reading some quaint piece of historiography.
08:19 -  This is current, cogent. It was intended for now. Jesus performed something in the divine mind of the Father of a special kind calculated
08:30 -  for our edification upon whom the ends of the age have come. It'll change your reading. So what's happening here?
08:39 -  They went up to Jerusalem for Passover, the three high holy feast days that required the males of Israel to come up to Jerusalem, and they had their Passover, and had left, and were on their way back home, and realized that their son was not with them.
09:00 -  They thought he was, maybe among the crowd, and they had to go back and find him, and there he was, talking, speaking and hearing. In verse 46, they came to pass that after three days.
09:16 -  Isn't that remarkable? After three days. Is that happenstance?
09:21 -  Why not two days? Why not four? He rose on the third day.
09:25 -  See, the reiteration of three, after three days, is so suggestive, and I'm not equipped to exposit why, but I'm touched by it. The reiteration of three, the triune God, three days in the grave, has a resonance
09:47 -  that should not be lost to us. After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors. Here's the thought that comes to me right now.
09:57 -  After three days, on the third day, how does it say, is it Haggai? How does it say, is it Haggai? Somebody help me, you scholars.
10:08 -  On the third day, we will rise, and we will go, and we will follow after the Lord and know him. Two days we have suffered, but at...
10:17 -  Huh? Hosea, that's it. On the third day, Israel's redemption comes.
10:24 -  After the third day, they found him in the temple. Well, when the redemption comes on the third day, we'll find him again in the temple. His sanctuary, his dwelling, his locus of his government and rule will be in the temple,
10:35 -  Zion. So, how appropriate that in this first episode of his childhood is a prefiguring of what will be his eternal place and stature after the third day.
10:48 -  How do you like them apples? Right off the cuff. Look, ma, no hands.
10:53 -  No previous consideration. It came on the spot. And you know that all of our readings should be punctuated with gasps of revelation.
11:03 -  Amen. So many people have signed my doom. You're under judgment.
11:09 -  You're finished cats. Who knows, but it might be true. But you know, one thing that keeps me encouraged is the spirit of revelation.
11:19 -  So long as I gasp, so long as I'm seeing things I've never seen before in familiar texts, you can say all you want that I'm under judgment, but I cannot be if the spirit of revelation is flowing.
11:34 -  So be jealous for that. Expect that, desire that, see that. These texts are inexhaustible.
11:41 -  They are as infinite as God himself. If ever it becomes a formulated, predictable thing, it has lost its glory. On the third day, after the third day, they found him in the temple.
11:55 -  Wow. What a prefiguring of the eschatological climax of the age by parents who had no thought. But the divine economy and the sovereignty of God saw to it that they would recognize
12:09 -  that their son was not with them. And when they got to the temple, it was after the third day. It had to be in order to punctuate the end of the age by being prefigured here even in his childhood.
12:23 -  This is a glory. And so, sitting in the midst of the doctors, 12 years old, both hearing them and asking them questions. Don't lose this.
12:39 -  How different that is from us who are more than 12 years of age, who don't have the patience to ask or to hear, but we have a lot to say. Our opinions.
12:51 -  So he's showing, even in his earliest youth, this is not the statement of childhood. This is the statement of even the mature Christ. It's an attitude that is open, wanting to hear, questioning men who are sages,
13:05 -  who have had histories in God, and drawing out from them. Is that descriptive of you? I haven't seen it conspicuously, as I've observed you with me in these days.
13:16 -  It ought to be descriptive of saints, to hear and to ask, to draw out. The word education, from the Latin root educare, is to draw out, not to sit in, not to program, which is what we're doing in the schools, programming.
13:35 -  You debase words by too frequent speaking. I'm a very quiet, silent man if you haven't noticed. Because I cherish speaking when it comes, and know that if we fill the air with our sound,
13:50 -  we debase its currency. Fewer words, but more meaningfully spoken. Fewer tears, but more authentically cried.
13:59 -  Be careful for being a sentimental sap, and easily played upon in the soulish realm, you're debasing true spirituality. So let us be accused of being dry-eyed and hard-hearted.
14:13 -  The Lord knows our hearts. We don't have to perform something, either to impress ourselves or others. We need to keep our hearts, dear saints, with all diligence.
14:23 -  Because we're called to be a piece of authenticity in this insane, schizophrenic world. Islands of sanity. So I like this about Jesus.
14:37 -  Both hearing them and asking them questions. Isn't that precious? And this is not your diplomatic young man
14:49 -  ingratiating himself with these older men by allowing them to give answers. He's not playing a kind of a game by which he puts on a salesman's demeanor and asks questions to be polite.
15:06 -  He's asking questions to be instructed. He wants to hear, he wants to know, he wants to understand. He wants to understand the Jewish heart, the heart of these elders, these sages.
15:18 -  Because when he comes of age, he'll be confronting them. So I like this attitude. Both hearing them and asking them questions.
15:27 -  And you can believe that those questions were gems, everyone. Anyone can give answers, but who can raise questions? Who can ask really cogent questions that draw out the deep of truth?
15:45 -  That's an art that's forgotten. It's more than just your curiosity. To frame a question is a greater skill than to give a pert answer.
15:58 -  And I was a teacher for seven years, and the heart of my teaching was to raise the questions. To impale my students on the moral hook. Those questions were not just fishing for information, they were searching questions.
16:14 -  Should we have done this? I was a history teacher. Is there any other alternative?
16:19 -  Was it right? Would you have done it? How would you justify it? Ooh, did we have sessions, and did we have converts?
16:27 -  I filled the whole youth section of my Pentecostal church out of my classes. By raising questions of an ultimate kind. Just out of the history material.
16:42 -  Okay. So, all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. The questions preceded his own answers.
16:54 -  When they saw him, they were amazed. And when the parents came, they were amazed. His mother said to him, son, why hast thou dealt with us?
17:03 -  Here's the Jewish guilt trip. That mothers know how to lay on their sons and wring their fingers. Don't you know that we were worried and long and concerned for you?
17:13 -  That's to bring the son into a kind of guilt trip. Why hast thou dealt with us? I'll tell you what.
17:25 -  If you're going to be about the father's business and his house, this is a necessary consequence. You're going to offend your parents. Or you're going to offend your children.
17:36 -  You're going to offend your flesh and blood. You can't be about the father's business and his house and not have this consequence and bear something of the reproach that Jesus has experienced that will be ours too.
17:50 -  If we have not experienced this reproach from our own flesh and blood, we may not have been as much about the father's business as we ought. Oswald Chambers in one of his selections for his highest speaks of this.
18:06 -  Don't allow yourself to be deferred from an obedience to God because of some consequence that will fall upon some member of your family because of your obedience. I had to learn this lesson at the very commencement of my salvation
18:22 -  when the Lord revealed Himself in the first reading of the New Testament. My first question was, what would my mother say about this? This will kill her.
18:33 -  So, if it kills her, it will kill her. But I am not going to swallow this down, let alone reject it because of a possible reaction on her part that will be severe.
18:45 -  There's a preeminence and priority of truth over every other consideration. We must not allow ourselves to be compromised because our wives will be offended or our children will not understand or so and so forth.
18:59 -  And that has kept many believers from the uttermost obedience to which we're called. You know what you find out? You offend your mother, yes. She shrieked, she hollered, she carried on, she cried out, he's gone mad.
19:12 -  But in her 96th year, 40 years later, in 20 minutes time, she's holding my hand and following me in a prayer to receive the Lord. Blessing follows obedience.
19:27 -  There might be an interim in which you have to wait, but the ultimate consequence will be blessedness, though you've risked your very mother's death by your immediate obedience now.
19:40 -  It's all there in the life of Jesus. He's the patterned son. We need to be instructed by Him because His walk was flawless. Now here's the point, dear saints, His walk was flawless
19:53 -  not because He had some advantage over us being the Son of God. This is not the expression of the deity which was His with the Father being equal with the Father. This is the issue of His humanity and His walk before the Father
20:11 -  in the same manner and means as ourselves. That is to say, He did not have an advantage having laid aside His deity more than we. So anything He says, anything He does, anything He performs
20:27 -  is through the operation of Spirit in relationship with the Father in obedience as a Son, which is exactly the issue with us. I want to disabuse, I'm on a single man crusade,
20:41 -  to disabuse the Church of its unquestioned assumption that Jesus being the Son of God had the advantage of deity so that what He performed we can admire but we cannot hope to emulate.
20:57 -  That is absolutely wrong. Read Philippians chapter 2. He emptied Himself.
21:05 -  What's the word? Is it kenosis in Greek? There's two words, one is to be filled, one is to be emptied. Let me turn to Forsyth.
21:14 -  Kenosis, the self-emptying of Christ. You know what this is? He laid aside His deity. What does that mean?
21:25 -  He came with no advantage and He had to learn obedience to the things which He suffered. Had He come with His deity, He would not have to learn anything. His deity would have been complete in itself.
21:39 -  We need to factor this in you, dear Saints, or we will just admire from a distance what we can't hope ourselves to attain. We will not ourselves become sons until we understand Jesus as the patterned Son,
21:55 -  having no advantage by virtue of deity because He forsook and emptied Himself of those advantages in order to walk in His humanity as a Son before the Father so that we would have a pattern that we could follow
22:12 -  and have by the same means that He employed, we will employ in the coming to maturity as sons. He who is without sin became sin. Isn't that a remarkable thing?
22:25 -  Whatever virtue we had, being born of the Holy Ghost and free from our Adamic nature, He took upon Himself freely and voluntarily, or He could not be the priest. There has got to be an identification with those for whom you're suffering and with whom you're interceding.
22:43 -  So this is charged with paradox, contradiction. It's a mystery, dear Saints. We're only touching the periphery, and yet nothing that I'm saying is at fault.
22:55 -  And yet what my brother reminds us is equally true, and somehow it's got to be fitted in. But for our advantage as sons, we need to see Jesus as the patterned Son, and that He had not the advantage of deity in His life of obedience,
23:12 -  and that even here in this very first episode we will see that Your Father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And He said unto them, How is it that you sought me?
23:23 -  There's a wonderful air of innocence about Jesus. This isn't the wise guy, a wisecrack, like getting back, you're trying to put a Jewish guilt trip on me.
23:33 -  Well, how is it that you even came? No, this is pure innocence. This is transparent. Like He's really surprised that they didn't understand that He had to be where He was.
23:44 -  Didn't you know that I must be about my Father's business? I took the word must, and I marked it with a yellow marker. I must. There's an urgency. There's no option.
23:57 -  This is implicit in my sonship to the Father. I must be about His business. Would to God that our present twelve-year-olds would have an attitude something like this, and who think themselves absolved, that they consider the back of the room
24:15 -  or wait for the meeting to be over because it has nothing to say for them. And they understood not, here's the beauty of this, they understood not the saying which He spoke unto them.
24:26 -  And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, the annus of Israel. Excuse my language. Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Even today in Israel, Nazareth has a reputation way down.
24:41 -  It's the least of cities of consideration. And it had that reputation then. Remember when the Israelite in whom is no guile learned about Jesus.
24:55 -  Can anything good come out of Nazareth? He went down. It's more than just physical descent. It's moral descent.
25:03 -  This going down with them is a statement of the genius of Jesus as Son, even at that early stage. Because He's going down not only to a lowly place, but He's going down with them.
25:18 -  Who's the them? The parents who do not understand the saying which He spoke to them. He knew that He will not be understood.
25:28 -  He has to suffer the tension of submitting to parents who don't understand His call, but that did not defer Him from a son's obedience. He doesn't make their recognition a condition for His submission to their authority.
25:48 -  There's something here of an ultimate moral kind that is the very genius of God that we need to understand and to receive. Especially those of us who've passed through that earlier charismatic time,
26:03 -  submission and authority, what do they call it? That was a pyramidal thing. The shepherding movement.
26:12 -  Who are you submitted to? And who are you? And so there was an association with famous names, and then you tithed, and these guys were obtaining palatial residences and tennis courts
26:22 -  and boat harbors, and that system came down with a collapse. It took its toll. Many marriages were destroyed. Many spiritual lives wrecked because they took the precious heart of God,
26:38 -  which is submission going down and made of it a system. This is organic. This is the very nature of God that is being expressed,
26:52 -  which Jesus expressed before this episode by coming out from His pre-incarnate history with the Father into the earth. That was a coming down into Nazareth.
27:06 -  The whole earth is a Nazareth. For God, for us, it's a garden. For Him, it's a Nazareth, but it didn't deter Him.
27:16 -  How come? That's His nature. This is God. This is not a system. And if it's not our nature, it will become a system and take its toll again.
27:30 -  So I think especially for Australians. Somebody told me at the breakfast line that there's a word that Australians use to knock down authorities.
27:42 -  Knockers, they take a delight in knocking down, that nobody will be at a place of elevation higher than themselves. It's a kind of an enforced equality of people who are not confident of their own identities
27:58 -  and are fearful of anyone that would appear to be intimidating. This is deeper, saints. This is genuine. This is not a principle to which you subscribe.
28:09 -  This is a life and a nature that becomes your own by union with God Himself because God Himself comes down. Do you realize that creation itself is a humiliation for God?
28:23 -  He didn't need to have a world. He didn't need mankind. He could have been complete in Himself and enjoyed His own deity
28:33 -  and fellowship with His own Son in the heavenly realms. He created the world, imposes upon God certain restrictions, certain limitations, certain obligations that is going to constitute for Him heartache, anguish of soul,
28:49 -  even the suffering and death of His own Son. So creation itself is a going down. The leaving of heaven to come into the earth is a going down.
28:59 -  And even as a child going down into Nazareth with them who don't understand Him is a remarkable statement even that early as to the nature of God being formed in Him and being expressed.
29:15 -  He went down with them. How many ministers have divorced their wives? Because they were not an appropriate helpmate.
29:24 -  And the wife was a friction, an attention, maybe rightly so, because I think women have a sense of integrity and when they see their husbands in their DVDs and their shorts,
29:38 -  they know them when they belch and have foul breath, but they see them on the platform as the man of God of faith and power. There's something that rubs.
29:48 -  The contradiction is very alive for them and their integrity can't swallow it down, and yet they're required to be submitted and go along for their husband's ministry.
29:58 -  Well, men of the importance and name as Oral Robert's own son got rid of a wife who didn't go along. She was taking her own direction and was establishing a kind of ministry.
30:14 -  She just was not an appropriate partner for a man on his route to finding a recognition which I hardly think he deserves. And in a sleight of hand, it took like an overnight.
30:29 -  Boom, she was divorced. And within days, the man's remarried and the body of Christ didn't even wink.
30:36 -  Nobody even was aware. And now the present wife, who is not the original one, is celebrated as the wife,
30:46 -  though God is so clear about hating divorce and putting off a wife, let alone to justify it for ministerial reasons and think then to have a ministry that can be anointed
30:58 -  and have the approval of God when that kind of sleight of hand has been performed before the face of the nation and the world.
31:07 -  So it means something to go down with those who don't understand you. I'm talking out of my experience because dear Inge says, why can't you tell jokes like other speakers?
31:22 -  She's constitutionally not able, and I don't even seek to persuade her if the Lord will not do it. I understand what he's after.
31:33 -  He's wanting me to go down and to be in relationship with one who doesn't give me the gratification that every man craves for
31:44 -  in the acknowledgement of his own wife. I have had to bear for the prophetic call. And if you have to bear it in any measure,
31:53 -  bear it with grace, as Jesus did. And here's the remarkable thing. Verse 52, Jesus increased in wisdom and stature
32:04 -  and in favor with God and with men. How do you like them apples? He went down knowing he's going to be not understood,
32:12 -  having to suffer and be chafed by that lack of acknowledgement. But the very going down and the very willingness to bear this kind of moral tension was the key to being increased.
32:27 -  And it's our key also. That's why whatever value you're getting from me is the measure to which I have gone down.
32:36 -  I have suffered this. I have borne this. Following the pattern, son. It's your way also.
32:44 -  If we're lacking in increase, there's a place where we have balked, where we have refused, where we said no.
32:52 -  But the remarkable thing is increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God. Didn't Jesus always enjoy the favor of God?
33:02 -  Well, this touched the Father's heart. He increased in favor when the Father saw that what he did was not compulsory,
33:11 -  but issued out of his voluntary freedom in making a choice that was in keeping with the nature of the God from whom he had come.
33:22 -  Not because he was filled with that deity and had no alternative, but because even in his humanity as a son of man,
33:31 -  he had already that kind of intimacy and sense of God that bore upon him that he would go down
33:41 -  and then by going down increase. So this first act is suggestive of all his acts because it issues out of what God is in himself.
33:53 -  Later on, what's his first act in the commencement of his ministry, his public ministry? Was to be baptized in the Jordan.
34:00 -  And John the Baptist was so astonished that Jesus came down into the water. He said, but I have need to be baptized of you.
34:08 -  You're sinless. You're the Lamb of God. Jesus said, it's necessary that all righteousness be fulfilled.
34:16 -  Baptized me. What was this baptism that John was performing? It was for a sinful nation,
34:23 -  an act of repentance and anticipation of a soon coming king and kingdom. Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand.
34:32 -  Jesus had no need to repent. He was sinless by a life of continual and perfect obedience of the kind that we have just read.
34:42 -  From commencement to crucifixion, he never once missed the heart of God in obedience, though every act of obedience was in some measure
34:53 -  the suffering of a cross. The cross was the consummation, the culmination of a lifetime of cross-like obedience.
35:01 -  Because obedience is suffering. Going down is suffering. Submitting to parents or to a wife who doesn't sin
35:08 -  is a kind of a suffering, of a moral anguish. So the cross was only the final consummation of what had ever and always been true,
35:18 -  even before Jesus took upon himself the form of a man. The cross and all of its meaning of self-denial of sacrifice, of going down for the benefit of others
35:32 -  was implicit in God before Jesus ever came into the earth. By coming into the earth, he demonstrated God. He revealed the Father by acts and conducts and speakings
35:45 -  that were always implicit in the Father's own nature. Got the idea? We need to appreciate this.
35:54 -  We have a truncated and inadequate view of Christ that will affect our worship and make it inadequate. Because the ultimate statement of worship is adoration.
36:08 -  This is another thing with me in these days. Where did you get a cancer? You're asking me?
36:12 -  I don't know where I get it. Certain things are born in your inner man, in your spirit, and all of a sudden the word adoration
36:20 -  begins to simmer and come alive. And then you remember that you were always irritated from your earliest days of conversion
36:27 -  in the assemblies of God when they used to sing about adoring Jesus, adoring. And you winced because you knew
36:34 -  that there was no correspondence in reality to the word that was being spoken or sung. Because you knew that the word adoration is an ultimate word,
36:44 -  an ultimate devotion, which you don't come to cheaply, glibly and easily. It's a process, it's the capstone,
36:53 -  it's the end of a life of believing. But the sooner it comes, the better. Because somehow, I'm not saying thus saith the Lord,
37:01 -  the issue of adoration is a key to power. I don't know how. It has something to do with the release
37:10 -  of the greater measure of God as power. Maybe because, I'm just talking off the top of my head, but because the one who has come to the spiritual place
37:20 -  where adoration for that one is authentic, it bespeaks a quality of relationship in such a way that God recognizes
37:30 -  and will entrust his power without fear of its misuse or self-aggrandizement. A worshiper is one who is totally lost
37:40 -  in God and adoration taken up with his glory and his purpose and would not ever dream or have even the slightest disposition
37:50 -  to misappropriate anything given by God so as to advance his ministry or any other ostensible good thing.
37:59 -  God can entrust him as a son and give the spirit without measure unto him. It will not be misused.
38:08 -  Adoration is the statement for which God waits. It's an authentic thing. I have not come to it yet myself, but I want to.
38:17 -  And it will come as process. It will come in growth and wisdom and in stature in favor with God as we go on,
38:26 -  obedience by obedience. Why did Jesus insist that he be baptized in an act that was given for sinful Israel
38:37 -  as a first step of repentance prior to the coming of the Lord? Because Jesus could not fulfill his role as Messiah
38:49 -  except in priestly identification with the nation in its sin. He had to go down and make a statement that though I am without sin, I am taking upon myself
39:03 -  this identification with you in your sin. Because if I remain on the bank and look down upon you with a certain level of superiority,
39:13 -  how can I ever beat you? The statement of the Father's compassion, mercy, and love that will lift you up out of that condition
39:20 -  and establish you as the nation that you intended to be. He had to go down. And this so much blessed the Father.
39:28 -  This was so much out of the voluntary freedom of Jesus, though it was in a certain sense disgraceful to go down into that muck and water
39:39 -  that when he came up the heavens opened and a dove came down and abided upon him and the voice of the Father rang out,
39:48 -  This, this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased. He grew in stature and favor
39:57 -  by an act which was not compelled. God did not give him instructions. See, if you think that, you yourself are so naive.
40:05 -  You think that when Jesus went aside to pray it was to receive instructions for the day? Now this is what's going to happen.
40:12 -  You'll do this, you'll do that. I think he went aside to pray for communion, to defer, to honor the Father,
40:20 -  to have that time of fellowship in which something of the Father was imparted to a son who was down before him.
40:30 -  And then everything rests on the voluntary freedom of this son. Because what is a son
40:37 -  if his acts are coerced or compelled? A son by nature, by definition, has got to come to that stature and maturity
40:47 -  freely through his own acts, his own obedience, his own sufferings. If it's compelled, then he's an automaton.
40:56 -  He's a puppet, he's being compelled to act. It does not glorify God, and it doesn't demonstrate the sonship
41:03 -  to which we ourselves are called. His every act is freely chosen. And so also are ours.
41:10 -  In Forsythe, he talks about Christ emptying of himself as not being the loss of his true Godhead,
41:21 -  but the very condition of it. Christ emptying himself is treated as one of the powers of his Godhead,
41:30 -  not a denial of it. What he's saying is, this is not a statement of weakness.
41:36 -  To empty yourself is not a statement of weakness. It's a statement of power. It takes something to empty yourself,
41:43 -  to be willing to be emptied. You couldn't help it because you're innately weak. What's the definition of meekness?
41:52 -  Surrendered strength. Meekness is not a timidity or a humility because that's the way you are,
42:00 -  you're just a soft touch. No, meekness and humility is out of strength, not out of weakness.
42:08 -  It's a surrendered strength that does not insist upon the strength, is willing to forfeit the strength
42:15 -  and the trust of God to reveal the nature and character of God himself. We're frequently being emptied.
42:23 -  Have you noticed? Have you been in such places? Are you willing to be?
42:27 -  You saw it even in these days how emptied I was, so devoid of inspiration,
42:34 -  of enthusiasm, of zeal, of interest even, embarrassing. Shouldn't I at least be interested?
42:41 -  You feel like a barren piece of protoplasm, like where's your distinctive, my God? You're preaching to these people
42:52 -  and you yourself lack the most elementary interest. You'd rather be someplace else? Cats, you hypocrite.
43:00 -  So those emptyings are ever before us, so there might be a filling. What happened in the upper room
43:09 -  prior to the day of Pentecost for ten days, if not an emptying? What do you think they were doing?
43:15 -  Twiddling their thumbs? They were reviewing their failure out of their own human bombast.
43:23 -  That though all the world deny you, yet will we deny you never. And every single one of them,
43:29 -  not just Judas, every one of them denied the Lord. John himself, whose head was upon his bosom, fled nakedly.
43:38 -  It was shameful. Peter denied him with oaths and cursings. And the night of terror when it came,
43:46 -  the truth of what men are, even in their most sincere religious principle, turned to vapor
43:56 -  and revealed the truth of what man is without the life of God, a betrayer. God forbid we should have to wait
44:05 -  for the night of terror to reveal it, because I can tell you that night of terror is coming. So they had ten days to reflect upon it,
44:16 -  because when Jesus came out, already having been beaten to a pulp and without sleep from Pilate to Herod
44:25 -  and down in the basement of the priest's home there in Jerusalem, Caiaphas's house, you can go down through steps that are carved out
44:34 -  and you see places where the iron hooks were in the wall where the victim was stretched out and lashed to a pulp and then lowered into a hole.
44:44 -  We went into that hole. You go down the staircase. Jesus was lowered in.
44:49 -  It's pitiful. When he came out in that condition, here's the fresh betrayal.
44:55 -  When the cock crows, before the cock crows three times, you'll have betrayed me.
45:00 -  Before the cock crows, you'll have betrayed me three times. And then Jesus looked at him and Peter went out and wept.
45:09 -  I don't know that he ever recovered. I think he wept through all ten days. And though the scriptures are discreet,
45:16 -  have you noticed that about God? Not only the scriptures, but he's discreet with us. If he ever lifted the veil,
45:22 -  if ever you knew the whole scoop, you wouldn't invite me. Every one of us shameful episodes
45:30 -  and indiscretions and failures that somehow are blotted out are kept from human gaze and consideration.
45:40 -  So also we are not told what went on in that upper room. But I can tell you that I know that I know
45:46 -  they were not twiddling their thumbs. There might even been some accusation. Well, you did this. You said that.
45:53 -  They had to get all that crap out of them and be emptied so they might be filled. So that when the day of Pentecost came,
46:03 -  like a mighty rushing wind, there were the prepared vessels emptied that they might receive the life
46:09 -  that has now come down from the throne and be utterly transformed by its power. So emptying is the great genius of God
46:23 -  coming down from heaven to take upon himself the form of a man. We ought to see that,
46:29 -  just review that classic text in Philippians chapter two, verse five,
46:36 -  Let this mind be in you. I think the better word is mindset, mode of thinking and being
46:46 -  which was also in Messiah Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robber to be equal with God
46:55 -  but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men.
47:04 -  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
47:12 -  Talk about emptying, emptying, emptying. The humiliation of God be confined to a human body and a Jewish human body
47:21 -  and the form of a slave and as the form of a slave being submitted even unto the death,
47:28 -  not just any death, the death of the cross. Humiliation, humiliation, humiliation,
47:32 -  emptying, emptying, emptying, lower, lower, lower, lower. There's no lower
47:36 -  to which the Son of God came than at the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him
47:45 -  and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven, things in earth,
47:53 -  things under the earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
47:59 -  You know what the Father is doing here? He's emptying himself. He's giving his Son a name above every name,
48:05 -  even his own name. The Father's willing, so to speak, to take a back seat,
48:09 -  to allow a preeminence for his Son and an exaltation that so to speak eclipses or diminishes even the Father.
48:16 -  Can you see? That the Father is acting out of the very nature of God to defer, to give up, to yield, to acquiesce,
48:24 -  to take the lower place in exalting his Son. That's why the Godhead has got to be a triune Godhead to see the way in which they relate.
48:33 -  The Holy Spirit can never exalt himself for what he is in himself. His one function is to exalt Jesus.
48:40 -  Jesus is to exalt the Father. The Father honors the Son with a name above every name even his own.
48:46 -  What a demonstration for us. We egoists, we ambitious ministers and the rest of us, my this, my that, I up.
48:57 -  So contrary to the nature of God himself. And until my Jewish kinsmen see this in the church, how shall they be moved to jealousy?
49:08 -  Because to see this is to see God as he in fact is and not as they nor we think him to be.
49:15 -  This is God. God is a self-emptying. God is a self-deferring.
49:21 -  He doesn't think of the benefit willing to bear loss in order to exalt, to lift up a nation,
49:28 -  to lift up a degraded mankind even if it requires an obedience unto death. That's emptying.
49:35 -  We suffer for an inadequate understanding of God because we suffer from an inadequate understanding of Jesus.
49:44 -  So that when a Dutch woman, I've mentioned this in other places, I'll always mention it,
49:51 -  who was married to an Israeli. She lived 30 years in the Kibbutz in Israel, speaks fluent Hebrew.
49:57 -  She's Dutch by birth, but she's totally Hebraicized. Her son is a believer,
50:03 -  darling boy going to a seminary in Holland. And she hated my perspective. Ooh, that woman, the hackles rose
50:13 -  when I came on the scene. She couldn't bear my perspective of apocalyptic devastation, suffering
50:19 -  yet for Israel and Jews worldwide. And for Israel itself, in which she had given
50:23 -  the major part of her life, married to an Israeli. And then she read the Holocaust book.
50:29 -  Where was God? And when I saw her the next time, she said, Art, your book has completely turned me around.
50:38 -  As much as I have opposed you, I now subscribe totally with your perspective. But moreover, she said,
50:45 -  because of your book, I realized that the God whom I was worshiping in the name of Jesus was Santa Claus.
50:53 -  I had put the appellation, the label, Jesus, but he was a construct out of my imagination, out of my own subjectivity,
51:00 -  out of my own desire for a God of a certain kind who'll run my errands, do my bidding, help me along. It was, you know, nice, but it was not God as God.
51:13 -  And we never intended in the writing of that book that it would be an instruction about the nature of God, but it is the revelation of God in judgment.
51:22 -  And that's that one aspect from which the church shrinks, they have no stomach, because it may contradict what you think God to be,
51:30 -  and you would rather have your subjective fancy than the truth of what he in fact is. I can go home now.
51:38 -  Now I said it. You needed to hear it. That statement has been made.
51:43 -  That statement has been made. It's on tape. Where did that come from?
51:49 -  You prefer your subjective fancy because it is accommodating and will fit in with the framework of your status quo
52:00 -  and your self-interest. It fits in nicely and comfortably. It does not jar.
52:06 -  It does not require. It does not radically displace. The God of convenience, called idolatry,
52:13 -  that can be performed even in the name of Jesus. The name does not assure you that you have the correct knowledge and understanding.
52:22 -  The correct knowledge and understanding comes from the contemplation of the Son and his emptying himself,
52:30 -  laying aside his deity, taking upon himself the form of a man and a servant and slave in order that what?
52:37 -  In order that he might die on a cross and the fulfillment of scripture and the necessary shedding of blood
52:44 -  without which there is no forgiveness for sin. We don't know as we ought to know, saints. I'm confessing for myself and I'm the speaker.
52:52 -  We don't know until we're prostrate and out on our faces like dead men. That's knowing.
52:59 -  And you know when you rise from that, however long it takes, you rise to adoration,
53:04 -  which is not an affectation, but the deep overflow of a heart that has come to a genuine comprehension
53:11 -  of God as God. Little wonder that my Jewish people are contemptuous of Christianity.
53:17 -  Even if they had not suffered forced conversions and exiles, just the church as it exhibits itself.
53:23 -  You know what the title has been in Jewish understanding for the church? The arrogant kingdom.
53:28 -  The hotshots. The know-it-alls. They have it all together.
53:31 -  Step one, step two. They've got it all down pat as principles, as dogma.
53:35 -  The arrogant kingdom. The very antithesis of what God is in himself is his humility, surrendered strength.
53:45 -  And that's the means by which we're saved from false apostles who have it all together
53:51 -  and know how to bring church correction, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Quote Paul, but they have not
53:57 -  the distinguishing mark of meekness They have not apostolic meekness. They have not prophetic meekness.
54:06 -  Well, Art, I don't see that in you in any conspicuous way. You're so insistent.
54:11 -  You're so... But that's meekness, saints. That's not human hubris.
54:16 -  The meekness is submitting to the will of God. Even if it invites your misunderstanding. See?
54:24 -  It's a going down. It's not a self-exaltation and an obedience that will discomfort
54:30 -  those who hear you. It's not calculated to win your approval, support and encouragement and admiration.
54:38 -  It's an obedience to what must be spoken. I'll tell you this. Just a few information.
54:44 -  Not only is it the words that I speak that I'm not at liberty to choose my own, but I can't even choose my own mood.
54:53 -  The tone of the speaking is as much to be the issue of God as the words themselves.
54:59 -  How do you like that? Where you're not even control of the mood through which the word comes.
55:06 -  And oftentimes, you will yourself be offended not only by what you hear yourself speaking, but the way in which you hear yourself speaking,
55:15 -  knowing it's going to be abrasive. And everything in your humanity would rather have it another way.
55:22 -  Well, why don't you have it the other way? Because I'd be disobedient. I've got to yield to the mood
55:28 -  of God's own speaking. This is sonship, dear saints, without which there's no propheticness,
55:35 -  there's no apostolicity, there's no church that is church, there's no moving Jews to jealousy,
55:40 -  there's no fulfilling of our destiny as the church of the nation. God will not fulfill His cosmic intention
55:49 -  except in keeping with the character and nature of Himself as a God who goes down,
55:55 -  a God who surrenders, a God who yields, who gives unto death. Let this mind be in you also.
56:03 -  Why does Paul say that? As if it's not automatic, because the spirit of the world
56:09 -  is entirely antithetical to this mentality. Take care of number one, see for your own interest if you don't,
56:16 -  who else will? Don't be a fool. You know, take, exploit, press, do.
56:22 -  Even in ministry. Make a show, be a hot shot. Let this mind, allow this mind,
56:30 -  this divine mentality, be not just your thought for the moment, but your continual mindset,
56:39 -  the disposition of your heart and will at all times. It's the well-meaning thing,
56:45 -  the well-intending that keeps us from the perfect expression of God. We ourselves obstruct
56:52 -  by our own zeal and intention, which if Jesus had conducted Himself that way, He would have forfeited His Messiahship.
57:01 -  So it's an obedience, a sensitivity. How do you attain to that art? First of all, you've got to be free
57:09 -  from any kind of imperative need to speak and to express. That you can hold the truth
57:16 -  without finding the occasion to insert it until the Lord Himself gives it, if He gives it.
57:23 -  I told the brother the other night, the Lord gave me a vision and call for Germany. I have a love for that nation.
57:30 -  I lived in Denmark, my wife's country. We made frequent trips in and through Germany. I never once opened my mouth.
57:38 -  For seven years, why does God give a burden and a call seven years in advance of its fulfillment?
57:47 -  Why doesn't He give it at the seventh year? Well, it's time. Why does He give it in advance?
57:52 -  Because there's something that works, that's good for us, to bear a burden
57:58 -  without being free to express it, because it destroys those vestiges of ambition for God's sake
58:07 -  and the other kinds of impulse that mar our sonship. Be perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.
58:16 -  We've not raised questions like this because we're more concerned to be polite than we are to be God-glorifying.
58:24 -  And therefore, the condition of our Church is lackluster, mediocre. We've allowed too many things
58:32 -  that however correct were in fact carnal. If it's not of the Spirit of the Lord in the moment of His choosing,
58:40 -  however correct it is in itself, it's yet wrong. May we come to that kind of sensitivity and be willing ourselves to be emptied
58:49 -  of the subtlety of our own ambition, to speak the truth for God. That's when God called Paul and...
58:58 -  Was it Silas in Acts 13 or Bonobos? Separate unto me, Paul and Bonobos, for the work
59:05 -  whereunto I've called them, doesn't even identify the work. And so, the Spirit spoke
59:12 -  into the congregation, naming men by name, separate unto me and send them, because they are separated unto me.
59:22 -  They're separated not only from their ethnic, Jewish, Gentile, Roman origins, they will not be painted in bringing
59:31 -  some aspect of that with them. That separation has taken place in the radical context of an apostolic body
59:40 -  called Antioch. God's call never came to Jerusalem. Why? They were all Jewish.
59:48 -  The ingredients for an apostle are the exacting and demanding environment of correction, of speaking the truth in love,
59:57 -  of men coming together in their diversity and differences, bringing with them their ancient enmities, Jew against Gentile,
01:00:06 -  black against white. They're name by name. Paul and one man is called Niger,
01:00:14 -  means black. So, he brought his racial identity into that mix. Another was a Roman, another was
01:00:22 -  from the Mediterranean. Places and races and nations and ethnic identities that have historically been at enmity with each other.
01:00:32 -  But when they were found worshipping the Lord together, the Holy Ghost said, separate unto me.
01:00:40 -  Because that worship, that adoration, its purity in the midst of the classic tensions of difference
01:00:49 -  had been healed. They'd come to a place of purging. They were separated, but separated not only
01:00:58 -  from their ethnic and racial entity, but from their religious ambition. It may be easier for a black man to
01:01:08 -  forego his color, so to speak, and adjure his ethnic pride than to give up the subtlety of our ambitious hearts.
01:01:16 -  Not for fortune, but for God. Isn't that ironic? That our ambition for God
01:01:22 -  can be the undoing and keeping us from the ultimate apostolic reality which the son himself was.
01:01:30 -  How jealous we have to be for this in order to speak the truth of love. So, we have to harken to the lesson of the Lord.
01:01:39 -  What it means to be emptied. Not only of carnality, but again, our best and well-meaning intentions
01:01:47 -  can do as much disservice to the purposes of God than disobedience.
01:01:54 -  Maybe more so. Especially as we move more deeply into the last days. And we will be called
01:02:01 -  for situations and crises of a moral kind. Every crisis is of a moral kind of choice and decision.
01:02:09 -  And no previous experience will have prepared us. And everything will rest on our intuiting, sensing God
01:02:19 -  as much as we are able because we're free from the imprint of our own personality,
01:02:25 -  our own humanity, our own religious zeal, to be correct. That's being separated.
01:02:31 -  Separate unto me. Men who don't even have to know what the work is to which
01:02:37 -  they're being called. Doesn't matter. In fact, they are so separated
01:02:41 -  they would have been just as content to remain at Antioch in the place of worship as to go forth from Antioch
01:02:47 -  in the place of service. Paul became the apostle in being sent. But he would have been as content to remain.
01:02:55 -  That's when God has a separated man. The last thing to die is the itch for service, for ministry,
01:03:02 -  for recognition, for doing good for God. He doesn't need our good. With man it is impossible,
01:03:10 -  but with God. Remember that rich young ruler? What good thing must I do?
01:03:17 -  Calling Jesus good man and instead of acceding to that compliment, Jesus stopped him right at that word.
01:03:25 -  Why callest thou me good? I don't want your flattery because it's altogether based
01:03:33 -  on a premise and an assumption that is altogether evil. There's no man good.
01:03:40 -  Only God. Why callest thou me good? I'm not buying your line.
01:03:46 -  I'm not getting sucked into your compliment and reinforcing your assumption that is altogether utterly opposed to God.
01:03:55 -  There's no man good. And what must I do gives you a way. You think there's something you can do
01:04:01 -  out of your humanity, rich young ruler who's kept the law from childhood on? Sell all that you have.
01:04:08 -  Not just your possessions, but your ambition, your desire to serve,
01:04:14 -  to do for God. Sell it all. Give it all over.
01:04:19 -  Follow me to the cross. And the disciples were astonished. Lord, who then could be saved?
01:04:25 -  What you're requiring is ultimate. With man it's impossible. But with God.
01:04:31 -  So I've had my first gratification. Often there's no gratification at all. No vindication at all.
01:04:37 -  In eternity we'll have our vindication. And the day of the Lord's appearing or the day of our ascending,
01:04:43 -  we'll hear, well done, good and faithful servant. But until that day, we live without that vindication.
01:04:49 -  And have got to take risks of faith and trust that are of a hairline kind,
01:04:55 -  that cannot be determined on the basis of principle and what's good and what needs to be spoken
01:05:01 -  and what's right. But that intimacy, that union that Jesus had with the Father,
01:05:07 -  the disposition, the mindset, that has got to be formed
01:05:13 -  by successive obedience and yieldedness and emptying so that when the crisis moment comes,
01:05:19 -  it will prevail. As I'm trusting it's prevailing now. Everything is inward, dear saints.
01:05:25 -  Calling for a walk, a progressive intimacy, a drawing nigh
01:05:31 -  by successive obedience of going down, Jesus increased
01:05:37 -  in stature and the knowledge of God and the favor of God. And so also do we.
01:05:43 -  You're receiving the value of increase that had its beginning
01:05:49 -  on this trip in Singapore and New Zealand, Melbourne before coming here.
01:05:55 -  Every act of obedience and they were fearful acts. I can't describe them to you.
01:06:01 -  There's nothing more terrifying than having to bring the word of God. And every obedience
01:06:07 -  has wrought something of increase so that by the time I come to you,
01:06:13 -  you're getting more than they got in Melbourne. Melbourne got more than they got in Sydney. And because of these days,
01:06:19 -  they'll get more in Africa. We're continually going from faith to faith, glory to glory,
01:06:25 -  in increase in stature by going down. I love this and I love that
01:06:31 -  it was explicated and demonstrated by the very Son of God Himself in being emptied,
01:06:37 -  limiting His power and that's why Forsythe in his remarkable insights says
01:06:43 -  incarnation is not impossible to the infant, it is necessary. The incarnation of Christ
01:06:49 -  to take upon Himself the form of man was a necessary wisdom of God
01:06:55 -  for the ultimate demonstration of God in the nature of God that ever and always was
01:07:01 -  but was concealed until it was performed. Stakes are great saints.
01:07:07 -  Stakes are great saints. The cross is ever before us. Obedience is ever a suffering
01:07:13 -  and you never know with certainty and have to live in the tension of perhaps missing it.
01:07:19 -  But what is worse than missing it is withholding it
01:07:25 -  for fear of missing it, for fear of offending, for desire of wanting to be approved.
01:07:31 -  And that cross has got to bring to death that deep, deep human thing
01:07:37 -  separate unto me. You know, dear saints, where is your Antioch in Australia?
01:07:43 -  Where is the Antioch of Australia where men are submitted to such rigorous
01:07:49 -  examination and truth and speaking the truth and love and their blind spots being identified
01:07:55 -  and the Lord dealing with their racial, ethnic origins, their ambition
01:08:01 -  that the Holy Spirit can again come and say, separate unto me by name that one.
01:08:07 -  That kind of church is suffering. That kind of apostolic reality
01:08:13 -  is suffering. Speaking the truth and love is suffering. Receiving that truth is suffering.
01:08:19 -  Church is suffering before it's a glory. And so long as we're only wanting amusement and enjoyment,
01:08:25 -  a nice service on Sunday, we'll fall short of the very requirement to bring forth
01:08:31 -  sons of this kind. Thank you, Lord, for such a son as you are.
01:08:37 -  And always were. Even before you left heaven to come down.
01:08:43 -  This was your nature. But you lay it aside as deity and obtained it
01:08:49 -  out of obedience. Obedience by obedience, the increase in the measure of stature came that
01:08:55 -  by the end you were the full-blown son of God as much as you were in the fullness of your deity.
01:09:01 -  And suffered that and brought that to death in your humanity at the cross. Lord, I'm speaking
01:09:07 -  for all of us, Lord. I confess 40 years is no guarantee of anything.
01:09:13 -  Even as heroic as that whole history has been all over the world in obedience, we do not know as we
01:09:19 -  ought to know. We do not know you, Lord, as we ought to know you. And to the degree that we don't,
01:09:25 -  we substitute, even unconsciously, images and subjective fancies, and we
01:09:31 -  call it Jesus. Lord, we're asking that you would make us devoid, strip
01:09:37 -  us of any accretion that issues out of our own humanity, our own religious
01:09:43 -  sensibility of a God of the kind that we would prefer who does not
01:09:49 -  exercise judgment, but is nice, loving, kind. And will never
01:09:55 -  execute vengeance, wrath. Forgive us, my God, that we didn't want to have any collision
01:10:03 -  with the tiny little notion of God that we had, lest we would lose it all. And may we
01:10:09 -  be reminded that what makes Moses Moses, the sent one to deliver Israel,
01:10:15 -  bring them to the wilderness and into the land, as he turned aside to see. The fire,
01:10:21 -  God in the midst of a burning bush, and not out of human curiosity, but to know
01:10:27 -  why that bush burned and was not consumed. When God saw him turn aside, he
01:10:33 -  called him by name twice. And whenever you call by name twice, you can start to tremble.
01:10:39 -  You know what follows is a mandate and a call terrifying in its proportions. Take off your shoes,
01:10:45 -  this is holding ground. Because he turned aside to see.
01:10:51 -  What's the big deal? Because the rabbis, once in a while, hit it right. And they say,
01:10:57 -  what God saw was a man who, when turning aside, knew
01:11:03 -  that once turning aside, you'll never turn back. Once you turn aside to see God in judgment,
01:11:09 -  God in the fire, God in the bush, God in his truth, in the midst of
01:11:15 -  fire, until you see him there, you've not yet seen him. You'll not turn back. You can't go back to
01:11:21 -  your charismatic foot in games. You can't go back even to the things that are correct. Moses had to go
01:11:27 -  up in 40 days of fasting, come up unto me and be there. And then
01:11:33 -  for six days he was in the cloud at the crest of that mountain of smoke. You ever been in smoke?
01:11:39 -  My God is fearful. You're totally disoriented.
01:11:45 -  I had to go into the house at Ben Israel where the fire began
01:11:51 -  and my tapes, my classic tapes were on the counter and my wife's purse.
01:11:57 -  She said, Art, go in and get my purse. I said, no sweat. I know that house like the palm of my hands.
01:12:03 -  I bent down to get under it and went in and the smoke engulfed me. And I not only could
01:12:09 -  not find the counter less than five feet away, I couldn't find the door through which I had entered. I was
01:12:15 -  totally, totally, humanly disoriented. Moses was six days in
01:12:21 -  that smoke. Six is the number of man. Prince of Egypt,
01:12:27 -  Levite, such distinction, such ability, such knowledge had to be
01:12:33 -  smoked out. And when he came before the Lord, he just brought
01:12:39 -  his organic, intrinsic essential, naked self. What else
01:12:45 -  could be brought before God that would not be an affront to him? Our distinctions, our accomplishments,
01:12:51 -  our knowledge. He was emptied and therefore God gave him the law.
01:12:57 -  He could entrust him. He received it from his hand. He received something more, communion
01:13:05 -  with the lawgiver because to bring down the tablets of the law without the
01:13:11 -  sense of the lawgiver is to do disservice to God. It's not a clinical operation
01:13:17 -  to recite the Ten Commandments. You've got to bring with the law the sense of the God who gave the law in the communion
01:13:23 -  on the mount when you have passed through the smoke and have been emptied of the last vestige, not of your vices but of
01:13:29 -  your virtues. What dealings God gave that man, Moses. And that's what it
01:13:35 -  will take to lead Israel out of Egypt, into the nations,
01:13:41 -  and into the promised land. So Lord, you're giving multiple messages
01:13:47 -  and they all say the same thing. What your son demonstrated in coming down from heaven
01:13:53 -  and emptying himself and lived in that submittedness
01:13:59 -  at the very first to his parents who didn't understand him, and to his nation who didn't understand him
01:14:05 -  is for our sanctification and the bringing of many sons to glory.
01:14:11 -  The Lord is after something ultimate in the image of his son.
01:14:17 -  He'll be glorified in his son. The head of a body that is like him
01:14:23 -  and a bride appropriate at a dawn for the bridegroom having that
01:14:29 -  nature. So Lord, precious God, we invited you in our prayer time,
01:14:35 -  we invited you at the commencement of this session, pull out the stops, don't spare us, let the word be as
01:14:41 -  a fire in our bones, and let it break, let it consume,
01:14:47 -  my God, whatever is inflammable, and we don't have to identify it. How can
01:14:53 -  we? Who knows his own heart and the secrets of it, but we can almost be assured there is hay,
01:14:59 -  wood, and stubble in every single one of us, including Kit Kats. He's not exempt by his
01:15:05 -  history, his service, or any other thing. He needs exactly what it is he's proclaiming
01:15:11 -  to others, because he's not yet come to the place of adoration. It's like water
01:15:17 -  being brought to a boil. It changes its form when the heat has had its full effect
01:15:23 -  and passes from water to steam. We pass from charismatic to adoration
01:15:29 -  when the work of God has been brought to its pitch. So let's welcome it.
01:15:35 -  It's a mercy, it's a love. He's not satisfied with us as we ourselves presently are.
01:15:41 -  He's bringing many sons to the glory in the image of that son, that patterned son,
01:15:47 -  who lay aside his deity and took upon himself the form of man, and suffered as a
01:15:53 -  servant slave unto death at the cross. Lord,
01:15:59 -  what shall we say to you, my God? Help us with a little help.
01:16:05 -  God forbid we should pass through these days, and this kind of love,
01:16:11 -  this kind of speaking that doesn't spare and not be affected, not be changed, be the same
01:16:17 -  as we came. You're pouring out, my God, you are addressing us as sons and daughters.
01:16:23 -  You are addressing us for what you're calling us to be, even though we are not presently in that
01:16:29 -  place. But your word will perform it. So we ask
01:16:35 -  that you would see to it, Lord, water what you have sown, dung it about,
01:16:41 -  and make it exceedingly fruitful, Lord. Oh, have an Antioch,
01:16:47 -  Lord. Have churches that are more than just casual assemblies of saints who want a Sunday blessing,
01:16:53 -  who know that the church that is the church is a suffering before it's a glory. It's an embarrassment, it's humiliation.
01:16:59 -  It's being found out. It's being confronted. It's being faced with our blind side that we didn't even
01:17:05 -  know we had, until someone loved us enough to tell us.
01:17:11 -  Oh, we bless you, Lord. The church is a glory. There's no society like that in the earth. It's all phony,
01:17:17 -  everywhere else, man-pleasing, thinking man good, calling Jesus good, good,
01:17:25 -  as if he subscribes to that standard of earthly human value, when what he has
01:17:31 -  is holy. So we bless you, Lord. Oh, thank you, my God.
01:17:37 -  Let your word form its work. We thank you for the sending of it,
01:17:43 -  and that great love that you have for us, which will not let us go. Keep up that
01:17:49 -  divine jealousy, Lord. Don't listen to our complaints and, oh, this is too hard.
01:17:55 -  You shouldn't have done that. Lord, don't listen to that. Just give us what you know
01:18:01 -  we need, and what form you know to send it, and we'll be forever grateful.
01:18:07 -  And thank you, in Jesus' holy name. God's people said. Amen.
