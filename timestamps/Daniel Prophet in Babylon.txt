Daniel Prophet in Babylon

00:00 -  So we're going to examine Daniel. You might want to read chapters 2 through 4, and we'll make that tomorrow's subject, because we want to see, is this man an anomaly? Do you know that word? A-N-O-M-A-L-Y. Is he a freak, a strange once and for all occurrence in history
00:21 -  that will not repeat again? Or is he a paradigm? Is he a pattern? Is he a statement for all generations? Is God still waiting for a Daniel component within the Church itself that can address kings, that can interpret? Because even the king said, can we find such a man
00:37 -  as this? The spirit of the God is in him and with him. They knew that what he had was extraordinary, and beyond any of that, the magicians and the wise men of Babylon. So Lord, precious, we're moving along here and defining almost as a consequence of what we're examining the
01:02 -  issue of propheticness itself. For after all, this is a prophetic school, and we want to know the sublime character of this ultimate calling, that by which you even equate yourself saying that this spirit of prophecy is your testimony. And so, my God, we know that it's been attacked
01:20 -  today and disfigured and disqualified and mutilated by the cheap, easy acceptance of almost anything that goes, that's called prophetic. If a man has a gift of dare or personality or retractiveness that he can be promoted or make the announcement of himself,
01:37 -  people follow in those. And so we thank you Lord for the way that you're honing in and giving us such clarity, sharp definition, my God, and how intrinsic it is to the Church that is the Church. And so we're blessed Lord, and we just invite you to continue what is upon your great prophetic heart.
01:57 -  We want to get into Daniel and his relationship as Rob's authoritative and prophetic figure, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Babylonians. Just think of what that implies. A Hebrew prophet in exile with the king, the potency of the greatest imperial power then existent in the world. It
02:31 -  makes Paul at Nausheim look like a minor note. This is supreme and ultimate contradiction, and I have never before seen it and I have never before expressed it, but right now. So we need to understand the context to appreciate what is represented here because I believe that this is
02:52 -  more than just a note of history. It is a paradigm. It is a picture of the end, that if the nations ought to be confronted, we will have to be with the same Daniel-like prophetic authority, making the same kinds of statements indicating who in fact is God, and bringing their presumptions to
03:13 -  an end, not only in the oracle that is delivered, but in the judgment itself that follows, that the prophetic voice brings the judgment into being. And that's why Daniel trembled to relate the meaning of the dream to the king because his very transmission of the giving of the understanding
03:35 -  is in fact it's released under setting of the emotion. So what a picture of the church in this prophetic constituency. I mean it's enough to be an oracle. It's enough to bring the word of God that is in every point in particular in opposition with the tenor of the nations in
03:58 -  their presumptive power, but to be also the agent of the judgment is the final demonstration and very much is in harmony with Psalm 149 that this distinction is given to the saints to bind with fetters, the kings of the of the world and of the nations, and put them in ions, and that this
04:17 -  judgment is the church's own privilege and distinction. In the little time that I had last night I was looking for some commentary that I could lay my hands on that that would give some further insight and I couldn't find any. I haven't looked yet at
04:38 -  Spurgeon's commentary of the treasury of David. I'm sure he'll have something to say of what this means, but most scholars are offended by this kind of reference that sounds so vengeful to having to do with naked power that the church will actually bind in ions and bring in fetters
04:58 -  those that oppose God and that this is their ultimate privilege and distinction as the church. Whatever that means, it means much and may the Lord unveil that for us. So maybe as we look into the prototype that Daniel is in his relationship with
05:15 -  Nebuchadnezzar, we may gain something of that insight. One that I read last night suggested that the problem is ours and not God's, and that we are so averse to judgments that we are offended even by God's announcing the particulars of it, and that only one who has been passionate for the
05:36 -  cause of God and seen it so long suffer abuse will have a desire to see God vindicated even as a vengeance. So we're experimenting with this. We've not been this way here too far. We want to explore what Daniel represents in his relationship with that imperial nation and its ruler as some
05:59 -  kind of prototype of that which will configure at the end of the age for the church and give us an insight and an understanding and what is the prophet and what are his preachments and his pronouncements and with what authority and how does he obtain it. So we ask my God that you would
06:21 -  be pleased to introduce us in your own precious way into the significance of this examination for the first time in Yeshua's holy name. Amen. Return to chapter four of Daniel where this episode is recorded. It follows right on the deliverance of
06:47 -  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego out of the fiery furnace that was an astonishment to the same king. For he himself says at the end of chapter three in verse 29, for there is no other God who is able to deliver in this way. So
07:13 -  what does that imply? If every knee is to bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord and that the whole category of rebellious nations in the end is to make this acknowledgement that the praise of God might go to the ends of the earth, will it require a demonstration of himself
07:33 -  as God, as radical and as violent as this? Will his saints have to go through a fire out of which only the God who is God can bring them and that the potent tapes of the last days will so observe this divine deliverance that they will have to acknowledge what Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that
07:52 -  there's no other God like this who delivers and that there's no other way for the revelation to come except by that same means. And how shall it be performed? By men who will not bow their knee to Baal and will deny the false Gods of their generation and of their nation and for that reason
08:14 -  be thrown into a fiery furnace heated up seven times and be delivered out of it for the fourth man will be there in the midst with them and not so much as the smell of smoke shall be found upon them. This is a remarkable admission for there is no other God who is able to deliver in this way.
08:37 -  And who is delivered? Those that he says in verse 28 who disobeyed the king's commands would not defer to the Baal system, to the pagan worship and deity who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king's commands and yielded up their bodies.
09:00 -  Well we can we can jump on every phrase here but this is too pregnant to just allow to pass. They yielded up their bodies. Will there be that demonstration of the last days to the nations and to the powers of who in fact is
09:18 -  God unless there's a people so submitted to that God that they will yield up their bodies in trust? Remember what they said? Whether he will deliver us or no, yet will we go into that fire because we have no alternative. There's no way that we're going to kind of ascend
09:36 -  to this requirement that we should should pay deference to any deity other than the God of Israel. If he will deliver us only good but even if he will not yet will we not be deferred from the yielding up of our bodies. Is that a description of your present consecration?
09:55 -  I pray certainly it doesn't even begin the church doesn't even begin to approach anything as ultimate as that but unless this demonstration of like kind comes at the end of the age how shall the Gods of this age acknowledge that the only one God and true God is the God who delivers
10:14 -  in this way. Verse 28, Nebuchadnezzar said, not Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Peshach and Abednego who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king's command his own and yielded up their
10:38 -  bodies rather than serve and worship any God except their own God. Therefore I make a decree any people nation or language that others blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Peshach and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses laid in ruins for there is no other
10:54 -  God who is able to deliver in this way. Then the king promoted Shadrach, Peshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon. Well I think that those servants that will yield up their bodies in life sacrifice will equally be promoted but not by Babylon's kingdom but by the mighty king.
11:14 -  In fact it's the anticipation of that promotion or reward that is a factor in their ability to make such sacrifices. Got the picture? Because in all our afflictions he's afflicted and his presence is a saving presence. By his very nature he's a deliverer but this is a kind of deliverance
11:35 -  we have not anticipated and it's not a deliverance from sin it's a deliverance from the consequence of obedience. That's an ultimate kind of deliverance and the Lord will be with us on that for as many as are willing to bring their bodies to that sacrifice. And so to get back to our
11:49 -  subject both the church in Japan the missionary western church of Japan and that in Germany were incapable of the sacrifice. They were unwilling for any discomfort that would come to their institutions let alone the actual sacrifice of their lives and they did bow their
12:08 -  knee to Baal. They did acknowledge the emperor in a nominal way. They didn't go to the Shinto shrine and bow and scrape and weep copious tears. They did it at a distance but they did it. There was a morning hour where in their schools the children had to rise and bow toward the emperor's palace
12:31 -  and pay some kind of acknowledgement to the Shinto shrine on those special feast days that the nation celebrated to show that they were loyal Japanese because the onus of this loyalty was upon them and looking and the Japanese looking upon Christianity as a western import
12:48 -  and only another faith posture having no more credence or credibility than their own or any other in the world and that the church was not able had not the authority or the prophetic power or boldness to make that presumptive claim that what we represent is alone God
13:07 -  that they allow themselves to be seen as another faith posture and only hope that they would obtain some measure of tolerance by which their schools could be continued and their services conducted. They lacked Daniel's heart and that of Meshach, of Bedindigno and the other brother who went into
13:29 -  the fight. If you can't pronounce it Cash, how are you going to do it? Let's go on here. This king has been given remarkable revelation of the God who delivers that would not have been his experience if there had not been willing candidates among God's people in exile and in
13:51 -  the fourth chapter the same king says to all peoples nations and languages that live throughout the earth notice the breadth of this proclamation and where does he get the presumption to think that his announcement will have that kind of credibility because his kingdom was of that
14:06 -  dimension it was imperial it was total the world bowed before the recognition of the might of this potent tape and so think of the frail hebrew children and what they are opposing the mightiest of all kingdoms on the earth and yet they did not defer for a moment and to disobey and you
14:28 -  and the yielding up of their bodies and now this king is saying may you have abundant prosperity signs and wonders that the most high God has worked for me i'm pleased to recount the most high God what an acknowledgement can you imagine the emperor of japan acknowledging that there is
14:45 -  a most high God and that he only is some petty official in the in that realm of government that the lord allows for the governance of nations but he is not himself deity that there is a most high God and who is that most high God he's the creator of the heavens and earth who happens also to be
15:03 -  the God of jacob and the God of Israel and that our setting forth of that God has been the most high is not some parochial attachment as if this is our baby and therefore recommending him because he's ours we're commending him because he's the God of all the earth and he's created all nations
15:25 -  and he is the most high God but he's also the God of jacob that's his distinctive identification and that's what rankles the nations they don't mind a general allusion to a most high God that's abstract but when you bring the scandal of specificity and say that this most high God
15:45 -  is the God of jacob and of Israel the God of the bible the God of the patriarchs the God of the prophets the God of the songs songists then the fat is in the fire and that's that's exactly our quandary so i don't know that this king has yet made that recognition but he must have to recognize
16:05 -  that the revelation has come to him from the sons of Israel whose God is the God of jacob and the God of Israel the signs and wonders that the most high God has worked for me i'm pleased to recount how great are his signs how mighty his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his
16:22 -  sovereignty is from generation to generation what thinking of that statement how do you like it do you think it's just a little obsequious note of the guy trying to sound generous or is it a profound statement that even the church that is today in the world has not yet acknowledged
16:46 -  this is profound acknowledgement because it includes his own kingdom as coming under the sovereignty of the most high God where does he say that art when he says his kingdom is everlasting that means its present its future and it's also past it's an ongoing and continuous
17:06 -  kingdom and his sovereignty is from generation to generation including the present generation and therefore even over this king king's kingdom this is acknowledgement this is submission and when the world will have come to it the age of history will have been concluded
17:27 -  and God will be glorified and his praises will be sung to the ends of the earth this is what the whole conflict is about is this contention by nations and the powers of the air who have their expression through them who refuse to throw in the towel and acknowledge that the most high
17:44 -  God is sovereign over all and that his kingdom is forever and everlasting when that acknowledgement will be obtained the age will be ended for it is the whole purpose of the age the whole read the heilsgeschichte of God the whole salvation history is to obtain this end and if this is
18:02 -  more than just a little historical moment but a paradigm and a pattern we have a little glimpse of how this recognition and acknowledgement will come to the great kings of this earth by the demonstration of this God through the sacrifice of the saints and that may well be
18:19 -  why revelation 13 7 says and he gave to the beast power to overcome the saints what we thought we were going to take the kingdom and cities by praise and turning up the amplifiers and taking what we're going to do a bunch of macho pyrotechnics no the lord says you'll take it
18:41 -  by the sacrifice of yourself you'll take it by exhibiting in your last day suffering from these oppressive powers who raged who don't who want to break his bands asunder by the way in which you bear the grunt of their attack upon you but what is ventilated upon you is the hatred for him
18:59 -  which they had one opportunity to express 2000 years ago and now in his physical absence it's coming upon you and the pun with sons and daughters of Israel even in their unbelieving apostate condition for they still represent the people of God and therefore God and you guys must be
19:18 -  exterminated together with them well has um plos alifat said first the saturday people then the people then the sunday people first we'll get rid of the jews then the christians for both are an abomination in the sight of islam for both represent a God before whom they will not bow
19:40 -  and have a scribe on the mosque on the temple site God has no sense and believe in their quran that Jesus was never crucified therefore how could he be risen oh yes i just got a little holy ghost chill
19:58 -  we need to be cognizant deeply aware of the issue of the age which will be brought to its fullest intensity of expression at the end of the age for which end we are intended and for which God has called us and given us birth both naturally and spiritually we must become the sons of God who will
20:18 -  not for a moment hesitate to enter the fiery first as our brother has done by the insistence that the state is not going to determine the means by which his child is going to be brought forth into this life it hates God and therefore doesn't want to allow his saints to express him and
20:36 -  therefore that they should be governed by the state and that that means a bowing of the knee to the whole bail system of which the powers of the air and satan their prince's ruler which we're getting only the first expressions of this conflict but it will increase and get
20:54 -  again again i have to say when it came to japan the church in japan collapsed they were afraid to suffer and therefore they rationalized the way in which they could make a minor concession well so what so our kids they know that God is really God that that the emperor is not really
21:15 -  so what does it matter if they get up with the other kids and face his palace and make a little bow or make some acknowledgement of the shinto shrine when the nation observes it as a national holiday it doesn't really count they don't really believe that in their hearts it's just a nominal
21:33 -  darling you read again the 10 commandments snow shall have no other Gods before me and thou shalt not bow to any God bowing is not a minor conversation bowing is giving the game away and the alternative to not bowing is going into the fiery furnace
21:53 -  we mustn't make even the most minor conversation whereas it's not minor it's major and once it's made the powers of the air have got you then they can say Jesus we don't pull them up who are you so then the name of the game is that if God is God and we stand for him and with him necessarily
22:13 -  there has got to be suffering and sacrifice come on let's make our peace with this that's been the truth of the church in every age moderate that was the name of the game it's not some some strange faith that befalls only a few it's the call and once we know what our peace is made with that it
22:31 -  doesn't matter what the requirement whether it's a fiery furnace or imprisonment or shame or stand or whatever so this king is making this remarkable statement to all peoples nations and languages i've lived throughout the earth i never can answer was living at ease in my home that figures and
22:54 -  prospering in my palace that goes with statehood and power and authority and sensual living and carnal delight that's your whole system is predicated upon it and you win people in obeisance to you in the promise of having some share in that kind of carnal and
23:11 -  sensual gratification see how i read the scriptures you need to read them in like manner yeah i saw and the fact that's why it's given why does God have to tell us that a little piece of petty information that he was at ease and prospering in his palace because it's a summation
23:32 -  of the whole genius of world power authority to the end of self-aggrandizement and gratification at the level of the census i saw a dream that frightened me my fantasies in bed and the visions of my head terrified me so i made a decree that all the wise men of
23:53 -  babelan should be brought before me in order that they might tell me the interpretation of the great of the dream then the magicians the enchanters the caldeans and the diviners came in and i told them the dream but they could not tell me its interpretation at last daniel came in before me
24:09 -  he who was named belter shaza after the name of my God can you imagine what does daniel itself mean daniel dan is judge the judgment of God isn't that remarkable a true name for his calling to bring the pronouncements of God's judgment which is at the heart of prophetic proclamation
24:35 -  or at least the sound them as warning but here he receives an exile of babylonian name after the God of babelon but it in no way lessens his true identity and he he showed his true identity by bowing before the God who is God three times a day at his window in public sight of all those
24:58 -  who would disparage him and by that act condemn himself to his own death but he would not retract a moment like Paul not for an hour would i allow the truth of the gospel to be compromised nor would i withdraw myself and pray out of the sight of men so that my neck would be preserved that i could
25:18 -  continue playing surely the lord doesn't want me killed he wants my prayers to continue so therefore i'll put myself in a safer place no he made a public proclamation by his prayer the boldness of these men and God saved him out of all consequences and told him at the end of his book
25:36 -  now you lie down and rest and you'll be raised up in that day and you'll receive your reward with the saints you've done your bit he has really done it that's why i said that more than elijah though elijah is very appropriate and i love the way the brother prayed that the fire of God would
25:52 -  fall on the sacrifice at brownschweig for our purposes now in the issue of the role of the church in its prophetic function no greater example for that than daniel so we want to study and understand the kind of man that he is how he purports how he deport himself and what is the
26:14 -  consequence so all of these false enchanters diviners magicians failed must fail but daniel was able to interpret the dream how come he had a special ability a gift clever even the king says who is endowed with the spirit of the holy Gods what a remarkable acknowledgement for a a gentile
26:39 -  king that the distinctive of daniel who alone is able to interpret what his skilled magicians and enchanters cannot is that this man as against those men has the spirit of the Gods what he really means is the spirit of God and that will be our distinctive also
27:00 -  how does it say well we have not the spirit of the world but the spirit of God to the degree that we do have the spirit of the world and have in any way make conversation to it we have not the spirit of God he has the spirit of God in full in battle he has the spirit of God in full in
27:17 -  exile what's our excuse and the liberty that we enjoy and we should not move and in the same fullness of power authority inside of revelation as this as this daniel that was his killing who refused from the beginning to eat from the king's table for he knew that it was more than
27:38 -  the issue of the luxurious dining opulent dining he knew that the condescend even to that table would already be a compromise and so to the steward let us see questions and if in 10 days we look like we're losing something we'll give up our insistence in 10
27:59 -  days he was radiant which is an argument for vegetarianism i can't help but have this great thought out of my experience in past years that in conferences or in times of meetings with other ministers particularly prophetic men invariably the meeting is followed by going down to the
28:20 -  biggest restaurant and and consuming having a lot of that why should i think that now is there anything intrinsically wrong with that or is there something in the pattern of it of men who are not as separated as daniel following up their meetings and fellowship that is usually hilarious
28:44 -  and buddy buddy and one of the boys type mentality where i always felt out of place at the same time where they're consuming consuming best portions of food there is some kind of note in that that should not be lost to us in comparison with danger who refused to eat from that table
29:02 -  at all now what that means symbolically and spiritually is for you to consider is there a place in your own walk in life where a temptation has been offered you that does not seem to be a sinful and yet to partake of it or to participate constitutes compromise only if you have a daniel
29:22 -  heart would you recognize that as danger and avoid it the thing of the lord's table and the eating and drinking is a reenactment of covenant commitment and in a kind of transposed way turning the other side of the coin this this eating is a kind of covenantal agreement with that ruler
29:44 -  you may not stipulate it or say it but the eating from his table implies agreement and probably in fact establishes it so i'm glad that the first one says when you sit down with a ruler or a church leader or a denominational head or whatever it is
30:02 -  be or be aware that something is at stake here than mere intake of protein but there's a spirit valence to the issue of the table that we have failed to recognize i remember how insulted a christian was at a message i gave once in which i talked about we have an obligation of the
30:22 -  stewardship of our bodies and to be excessively overweight and obese is an offense to God and is contrary to the spirit and must necessarily fell the spirit and this man waited for me in the hallway after the message to take me up on this because he felt that it made no threat to his
30:41 -  spirituality at all and the guy was so rotund he was a he was a barrel with legs and it wasn't what he called the the organ that everyone says is wrong thyroid i've never heard so many people thyroid complaints in this generation
30:59 -  they're overweight i'm not denying it but hope that it's true and not really an excuse for justification but this man was unwilling to say that the issue of the body is also the issue of the spirit and that he could afford to be as overweight as he wants and gorge as much as he
31:17 -  wants and still be spiritual because what has that to do with the spirit and my answer is more than you know because anyone who fasts and is also a preacher or speaker of the word knows that there's an acuity and a sharpness that comes in your perceiving and expressing the word
31:37 -  that is the result of fasting i've got the most powerful words that i have ever spoken not always but more times than not have come out of a fast so whatever is implied in the denial of the flesh through fasting somehow has a consequence for the realm of spirit that makes
31:57 -  it more coaching powerful and penetrating so there again we have another especially same thing i hope i'm not coming off like some fattest or against food against eating in a level that but but understand this and receive this and i'm still absolutely persuaded that my daughter has been
32:16 -  saved from the ravages of cancer and likely death by the daily communion that i fed her for 10 consecutive days i gave her i gave her from another table the table of the lord foundational thing not just in the spirit realm but that the life of God in the bread and in the wine
32:38 -  would infuse herself and bring life bearing power into these cells and i understand she's making a marvelous recovery i doubt very much if she's continuing in that daily taking of communion but i felt that as a critical juncture when when her provision did not look promising the issue of
32:58 -  the lord's table not man's was a life-saving provision and so i encourage you also again as often as you will to know that what we're receiving is not an emblem or an abstract sign of something but the substance and spirit of the finger himself the reality of the spirit
33:18 -  of the life of God love not the world i personally have difficulty in giving credibility to preachers who are overweight whose gut laps over their belts they might have wonderful words and i somehow i can't acknowledge the authority of such a man seeing
33:41 -  that he himself cannot govern his own body so maybe i'm at fault in that but i'm very concerned myself that i should not discourage others from believing the word of God out of my mouth because my credibility is affected by the visible evidence of indulgence
34:02 -  okay back to our text because i want to look at a paper that i found among my papers and the phenomenon of preaching well what is that what is daniel and what is a prophet in the last analysis and what is the church and its prophetic stature in the last days for those who
34:20 -  proclaim a word of God to the nations to the magistrates and to the rulers in the authority of God so the issue of proclamation of preaching is more than the issue of technique or um homiletics is something that i want to examine as we come to the end of this looking at this
34:41 -  chapter so then the king acknowledges that daniel's endowed with the spirit of the holy Gods and that no mystery is too difficult for you hear the dream that i saw tell me its interpretation and verse 10 through 12 reviews that dream you can read it yourself if you're not familiar with it
35:03 -  of a great tree that whose branches are spread and visible to the ends of the whole earth its foliage is beautiful its food abundant provided food for all the animals will feel found shade under it the birds we are nested branches and i'll permit all living things
35:15 -  were fed and then it continues from verse 14 that that this tree is cut down and its branches are chopped off the script of its foliage and its fruit is scattered and the animals flee from beneath it the birds from its branches but leaves its stump and roots in the ground with a band of iron
35:32 -  and bronze in the tender grass of the field let him be bathed with the dew of heaven let his lock be with the animals of the field and in the grass of the earth let his mind be changed from that of a human and let the mind of an animal be given to him and let seven times pass over him the
35:50 -  sentence is rendered by decree of the watchers some angelic entity that have authority to establish this by decree the decision is given by the order of the holy ones in order that all who live may know that the most high is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals or men or mankind
36:10 -  and he gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of human beings what a remarkable dream what daniel to interpret and that the king is yet convinced that he's able to interpret it though all others have failed because he's endowed with the spirit of the holy Gods verse 19 then
36:30 -  daniel was called delta shazam was severely distressed for a while his thoughts terrified him the king said do not let the dream or the interpretation terrify you and daniel answered my lord may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies so already
36:52 -  daniel understands that the dream is intended for the king himself and that in fact it's the pronouncement of the declaration of a judgment and a prophet cannot withhold the words of judgment that's how samuel began as a boy and when the lord called him three times
37:11 -  and he finally understood that it was the lord and and received the word that was the judgment on eli the priest the man for whom he had had the greatest affection and who had become in every respect his father and yet when the when eli said in the morning what did the lord say to you
37:31 -  samuel did not withhold one word of judgment that he had to share that is to say that Israel had been without a prophet and that a prophet is restored to Israel to guide the nation through tremulous times because the lord would not allow samuel's word to fall to the ground because samuel
37:53 -  had honored God's word and related it unsparingly though it was a word of judgment God subsequently honored his words and therefore the whole of Israel had the value of true prophetic proclamation as its guide but the key was the first requirement of obedience in bringing a word of judgment
38:14 -  and so here also daniel is faced with the same obligation and we will be faced with it also and to some degree i'll already speaking those things that pertain to the future judgment of Israel though those words are terribly unwelcomed and as wrote upon our heads greater reproach
38:33 -  any single thing else of the 37 years in the lord so daniel recites the truth of this dream and it's a judgment for this king who has grown great and strong in verse 22 whose kingdom has increased and reaches the heaven and your sovereignty to the ends of the earth and
38:52 -  whereas the king of verse 23 so i wholly watch it coming down from heaven and saying cut down this tree and destroy it the leaf of stuff and roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze and the grass of the field let him be bathed with the dew of heaven let his luck be
39:03 -  with the enemies of the field and for several times best helping this is the perpetuation of king it is a decree of the most high that has come upon my lord the king you shall be driven away from human society how fierce this is and how uncompromising this prophet is in giving the
39:22 -  full statement without in any way tempering that or removing anything of its sting you shall be driven away from he's speaking to the great potent tape of that age and all the earth recognizes the magnificence of this great king nebuchadnezzar and here's a hebrew prophet in exile telling him
39:41 -  you'll be driven away from human society your dwelling will be with the wild animals you shall be made to eat grass like oxen you shall be favored with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over you hopefully you have learned that the most high has sovereignty over the kingdom
39:56 -  of mortals and gives it to whom he will and that raises an interesting question everybody know what that is based on the text that we have already considered where this same king acknowledged that God is sovereign over all and that his kingdom is everlasting why then is he required
40:16 -  to face this severe judgment of seven times sounds like seven years out in the open that the dude will fall upon if they live like any animal in the field his his nails will grow to be claws his hair will become matted he will become a beast to lose his human qualification to be divorced
40:34 -  from human society what a fierce judgment in order that he might learn that the most high has sovereignty of the kingdoms of men and gives it to whom he will hasn't he already acknowledged that in his previous statement the chapter in the first verses of chapter four how great are his
40:50 -  signs how mighty is wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and the sovereignty is from generation to generation just for your edification just to let you know the question that i'm raising is the first time i've ever raised it the first time i've ever seen it yeah i'm seeing it with
41:05 -  you over the text right now why am i telling you that that you should not think that this is some canned presentation prepared in advance although there's place for preparation but that you should read the scriptures in such a way that you raise the questions because that is true reading to go
41:24 -  through a text blithely uh that that that you've read your chapter for the day and not seeing hey this is a contradiction what God is requiring this judgment but the man has already acknowledged these very things for which this judgment is now to be given what am i to make of this that's the
41:39 -  way the scriptures are to be read so i'm just pausing to say i'm doing this right before your that's an important question so what must we summarize that though he had made this pronouncement to the to all of this kingdom the word went out to all the earth and it sounds so
41:54 -  sincere that evidently he didn't believe in his heart what his mouth had proclaimed and that therefore it was important enough for God to bring them then into a personal judgment if it was not enough to come to this truth in his heart by the demonstration of the sons of Israel in the fire
42:13 -  furnace then what is the next thing and then the man must experience in himself some degree of a fiery furnace of the judgment of God for that's how critical the acknowledgement of God as the most high is and if God will go that far with a pagan ruler how far will he go with his
42:31 -  own church and to what degree here the question is coming on to what degree are we in the place of verbally agreeing but not in our hearts and for that reason if we have not been persuaded by the word of God then something must come into our experience of a kind sufficient to bring us
42:51 -  to the depth of awareness that is requisite for a saint of the last days therefore oh king may my counsel be acceptable to you atone for your sins with righteousness and your iniquities with mercy to the oppressed so that your prosperity may be prolonged oh i like that because what
43:09 -  you know we're getting here we're getting a definition or description of what constitutes prophetic proclamation not only the word of God made clear but a and a judgment announced but a call of repentance to this king by which the judgment might be alleviated
43:28 -  you know what this could have meant for Daniel how dare you suggest to me the king of Babylon who has graced the world with a tree that has flowered and many are living under its branches and the trees abide the birds abide in its ruins and and the blessings that have gone
43:47 -  in in my benevolent kingdom that i should be submitted to this requirement to atone for what sin with with righteousness iniquities with what iniquities what mercy so to the oppressed i'm not oppressed until the prophet tells you you don't you don't even know the truth of your
44:07 -  condition until the church reveals to the world the truth of its condition it will be as who me and its naive rejection as this king all right david and nathan oh david and nathan there is another instance where the prophet's proclamation is the statement of truth as God himself sees it
44:26 -  and cannot come to men except through proclamation and that this requires a courage and a boldness with no equivocation or compromise so daniel is giving this king full vor and if this is more than just historical moment but a paradigm for the last days then there must be in the earth and
44:48 -  before the nations and the potent pace and the hot shots of our age even american presidents let alone an arafat a proclamation of such a kind of such an authority before the end comes and maybe that's implied in this gospel of the kingdom shall be proclaimed to all nations and then shall the
45:09 -  income but this gospel is not some little chintzy step one step two step three how to get saved but the proclamation of judgment that is imminent and that will fall on all nations who will not repent for its presumptions presumptuous arrogance against God and that they have elevated themselves
45:27 -  above the most high and done their own thing without his consideration and that's exactly the thing of which Paul warns in act 17 that God has appointed a in which he will judge the world by that man whom he has raised from the dead he's written times past but he commands now all men
45:46 -  everywhere including their rulers to repent what if the king had died in his partial and inadequate knowledge well we'd have to live with that eternally and there'd be a shriek and a howl in what could not be limited so the mercy of God is in the anticipation of of what his eternal
46:06 -  faith would have been and therefore that justifies the severest dealing now as a mercy in the avoidance of that calamity and this has got to be a conscious component in the prophetic church that it takes eternity into its consideration for that will enable us to be bold and to be fools
46:23 -  and to say things and require things that God gives us to proclaim knowing that what is at stake is not just some temporal adjustment in time but the eternal fate of our heroes thank you for that note and also that he was appalled he's not some as you said some hot shot blowing the boom and
46:40 -  enjoying it his own soul travails at having to pronounce it and unless that's our disposition we might even be employed by God okay never can ever represent something more than himself with all nations and back all the world and that this judgment is for all to bring this recognition
46:59 -  knowledge of God i wonder if we could even suggest that the judgment has already started and that nations that have been proud have found themselves out in the field and have lived and become as animals and have lost their human distinction that has been true both of japan
47:15 -  and germany in world war ii they behave worse than animals i think if that's true and God is in his mercy giving in piecemeal something of the same judgment to all nations in the last days what it would require then is a prophetic interpretation of that to which nations have
47:33 -  already passed that they might receive the benefit of having been reduced to animals and having claws and becoming beastlike and losing their distinctive humanity that they need not suffer it again so this is a remarkable paradigm you have just with that statement brought it into
47:48 -  the largest cosmic context and i think it's perfectly appropriate and i want to give a homework assignment for any man who wants it and i'll tell you that if you do it it will affect you profoundly and it's this to compare the first statement of nether kinesa at the commencement of chapter four
48:05 -  which seems to be a very profound acknowledgement of the most high God as against the statement that he makes at the conclusion of chapter four what's the difference in the two statements of assessment and acknowledgement of God as God and i think that that will be a most rewarding study
48:26 -  and don't neglect the way in which his statement ends for i never can as a praise and extol and honor the king of heaven for all his works are truth and his ways are justice have you come to that all his ways are truth and his ways are justice and that he's sovereign in the heavens
48:43 -  overall and is from generation generation well that has to include the maximum of course what are you saying then that that that was just that was justice and that it was a work of truth see the main it erases remarkable questions about God has gone and then he ends and he is able to
49:03 -  bring low those who walk in pride and this is the final capstone because who is more the epitome of right than this king himself and God brought him low and that he respects the God who is greater than he because he has the capacity to make him aware of his own pride and to break him in it
49:21 -  and to bring him very low which is which in fact is the character of the God himself who brought him to that that's God's own uniqueness God himself is in the lowly place so the king receives a recognition of a greater king whose character is what shall we say ultimate and yet
49:42 -  the issue of lowness and humility is the prime and ultimate thing to which men must be brought in their agreement with God who himself is that got the point hey we've got to read the text really read the text really ponder what is being said for there's not a single word out of place
50:04 -  of all of the things that this king might have said what does the lord allow to be inspired and be set down in scriptures for all generations there's a statement about a king who is able a God to bring well those who walk in pride we've got to invest ourselves in this text
50:23 -  and if you compare the text of the commencement of the chapter and his assessment of God with his final statement you're going to have the richest discovery for yourself and once you'll be so spoiled by dealing with the word of God in this kind of exegetical intensity you'll be
50:43 -  ruined for all the future you'll never again be able to read a text casually you'll have wow if that's what was revealed and look at the meaning here that said that then every henceforth every treatment of the scripture will come into new intensity and death you'll be benefited for all
51:01 -  your grace not anyone who's called to the place of rule especially needs to come to this recognition of the most high that brings us to life so we put any place of authority in the church those that have rule and authority need especially to come to that place God dealt more severely
51:21 -  with medical neza than he would with some rank-and-file member of his kingdom let not many of you be teachers for upon you comes a greater judgment of course we are speaking about people in places of rule and authority what shall we say of daniel himself how could he have
51:37 -  spoken effectively to this king unless he had a comparable if not a greater authority in God and let even higher office and if this was required for the king to bring him low what was required for daniel to bring him low to save the prophet from exalting in in bringing a judgment rather
51:57 -  than being a pope the scriptures are silent but we can assume that anyone called to that kind of authority that's going to challenge kings must himself have a history of dealing with God by which he's brought forth and if it could happen over a table like this through the examination of
52:13 -  the word rather than having to experience it in fact i count that a very great grace and in fact that is the characteristic of the word of God and it has this potential to affect life and character by charisma without the necessity to experience what the king himself did you make it your own
52:31 -  prophets go through an intensive preparation if he had not that character would he have enjoyed the spirit of the Gods with the spirit of God been with him in such measure as the given illumination and ability to understand dreams that speak so significantly to a king
52:49 -  except the spirit of God was with him that even never kinesa had to recognize what i'm saying is that this is not some mindlessly positive from God but that the issue of character as we said yesterday is relative to charisma because he had this character which is to say the character of
53:07 -  God the lord could give him his measure his spirit in full measure or in great measure as a son who is like unto the father and that we also likely therefore have the spirit in measure as our character approximates that of God and that's not some kind of blanket thing that we can invoke
53:28 -  or that's as charismatically ours automatically independent of what we in fact are before God in the truth of our lives because the spirit of God is the spirit of truth and the spirit of God is designated by a dove and will not alight on anything as the book spirit of truth shows
53:50 -  noah sent out a raven that never came back because it will abide on anything anything that flows even crap but the dove returned for it found no place for its food it will only abide on that which is compatible to its own meek nature does like nature and so the the character of daniel
54:12 -  though it's not expressly stated comes through in his demeanor and department waiting to be called by the king and then it's a humility to speak the full judgment about mincing words though he was appalled by what he had to say he did not withhold it that's meekness it's submission
54:30 -  to God in a full obedience the same kind that Jesus expressed in overturning the money changes tables though it was a violent act it was out of meek obedience before the father okay it says of Jesus that God gave not the spirit by measure unto him that means that he had the unlimited and full
54:51 -  provision of the spirit of God and access but if he did not give the spirit by measure to him does he give it by measure to others is there a measure so our own history as believers shows it we know that there are men who have greater unction greater known things and that even
55:10 -  within those men depending on their walk they can see the fluctuation of their anointing so it's not some automatic thing yes there's a gift and a calling that God will not withdraw but the full expression of it probably it has to reflect one's walk with God at any given time
55:28 -  i can't believe that God would give his power in some unmeasured way to those who will abuse it and take it to themselves to obtain self-exaltation to what they express in their authority in fact before long i think the gift might be retained mechanically the glory of it will have
55:53 -  departed as God took his word from this world we'll talk about the gift of God was his own presence so this needs to be explored on this the issue of anointing the spirit of God and probably we have done injustice in our charismatic generation by being too bland too
56:15 -  mechanical and even now suffering the consequence of calling many things from God that in fact may have a source of a completely other than kind but it's expressed in power and some seeming evidence of that reality and yet its source is not God himself and many are impressed and completely
56:34 -  captivated and taken by it because they know not God you know as they thought so that's a really important line of endeavor speaking of Israel yeah that the gift and calling of God is irrevocable but has Israel been functioning in that gift and calling in
56:53 -  its history and the answer is clearly no it's irrevocable it will not be totally and entirely dismissed the real time in which will be activated but there could be a season in which it was thrown so the history of Israel itself an indication and probably individual lives and ministries can
57:11 -  well experience the same thing might be interesting to ask in what way has Israel continued in its gift by subverting and misusing it yes we have a gift to a light unto the world but what kind of light have we expressed and communicated to call young through eric foam and freud and
57:35 -  and other of the great whites of Israel who have served the purposes of the world and have been a demonic force and yet enormously gifted so maybe there's a way in which the gifting and calling of God that is irrevocable can also be subverted and be misused by the powers of
57:51 -  practice that have now become the spirit of that people and will come into its right use from the spirit again of God has his possession God will not be knocked even by his own words yeah now her brother made an observation about russia in our break time that i thought was
58:08 -  very significant about a nation already experiencing the judgment of being cast out into the fields living like animals losing its humanity this is the realm of our brother's activity in that part of the world and i said well then you need to
58:24 -  interpret for them the meaning of their being cast out into the field that is designed to bring them low well i'm an evangelist yes but what is the gospel it's the gospel of the kingdom it's the issue of contending kingdoms God's redemptive program for all the earth and that
58:45 -  it's not the gospel unless we bring this kind of context rather than just a manual on how to get saved step on step too but then what will that cost you as a canadian in the ukraine or in russia who is in fact by their view an exile out of your own country and in theirs have you the right to
59:05 -  make that kind of proclamation and to give that kind of interpretation and will you have the boldness series so the issue of proclamation and preaching which is my subject now is critical and before i get to a little paper on that subject just a devotional commentary yesterday and today
59:24 -  from eugene peterson about values because the issue of contention between kingdom is not just the issue of who nakedly is right in final sovereignty over creation but the issue of which value system is going to be communicated to men that they might live in righteousness upon
59:43 -  the earth there are two ways in contention two wisdoms in contention and we need to be reminded that we're not just communicating a religious alternative but an entire way of life a motor being that has its origin in heaven and yet is intended for men in the practical their life on
01:00:01 -  the earth so in that sense this brother asks what are our values in the christian way we acquire a healthy value system we find that persons are more important than property we learn that forgiveness is preferable to revenge we realize that worshiping God is more central than impressing
01:00:21 -  our neighbors isn't that remarkable statements this is a complete controverting of the values by which the world presently lives its life and that's why when we bring the gospel to a jew you're not just offering him a religious alternative you're requiring for him the actual
01:00:37 -  upturning of everything to which he has subscribed as being false and in error and contrary to God and calling him to a new mode of life that he cannot live on the basis of his jewish excellency but on the basis of the spirit of life given him in conversion by new birth have you got
01:00:55 -  that this is the gospel this is preaching and that's why to the jew first is the test of the church why to the jew first because they are the epitome of a world system predicated on values that are contrary to God and yet the whole world has gone after it as being the self-evident wisdom
01:01:15 -  of how to live rightly take care of number one seek for your material success if you've got to cut corners in terms of morality you do it this is a competitive world and if you don't do it then somebody else will after all your family has got to be cared for and so it goes and goes into the
01:01:34 -  film industry into books into articles into things that influence the entire mode of living of the whole world so when you challenge a jew with the gospel of the kingdom you're bringing another heavenly value system that is in complete contradiction through all to which he has subscribed
01:01:53 -  all his life long and saying your whole life has been misspent you've lived it in error and you'll be eternally judged for that terror if you do not repent of it and change your mind that's what the way repentance means and take to yourself another mode of living and value system which is heavenly
01:02:11 -  and which is God's how many christians who bring the gospel know that that's what is at stake i have to know it consciously in order to bring it and to know therefore that's why they're going to be so savagely opposed as i gave you the example of my first missionary attempt in kansas
01:02:29 -  city lord what do i do i don't know how to be a missionary to the jews i spent a year in training with moist rose in new york city and now i'm in the field but what do i do well i took the the wash to the laundromat and i didn't know how to operate it so i asked a woman she's jewish
01:02:46 -  and we got into a conversation and she was interested in what i was about and why i was in kansas city you need to speak to my husband these orthodox i said i'd love to and so when should i come come on the shabbat is home i came on the shabbat with my bible under my arm fuzzy
01:03:00 -  tail bushy tail ready to do God's service and i came up the steps the man was waiting for me at the door and when the door opened he said how dare you it was like the mask of civility was off nice guy sweet-spirited he'll talk about any subject he's erudite he's learned he has a bachelor's
01:03:21 -  degree he's nice in the jewish community until this subject the mask is off and something savage and anti-christ and fierce was expressed how dare you the venom was coming down his mouth how dare you come and bring this to me on the shabbat wham there was the door right right in
01:03:46 -  my face and on my nose rightly does jacob yosh j o c z now gone to be with the lord of hebrew christian theologian say that it's the gospel brought to the jew that reveals the truth of its radical content that we ourselves do not see it nor understand it until we face the kind
01:04:07 -  of opposition that jews express toward it and that's why Paul says in moments that they are the enemies of the gospel for our sake their opposition is a revelation of just what it is that we bear in this gospel that is at the root of the offense to the world for it contradicts
01:04:28 -  their entire value system and that's why it said of the apostles these are they who turned the world upside down and it needs again to be turned by those who will come in that message requiring the anointing of God in boldness recognizing what their message represents and how it will be
01:04:48 -  opposed and yet needs to be proclaimed well it's a mercy to bring that message and to bear the uh the offense the oldest scandal of the gospel why is it a scandal because in every point in particular it's predicated against the wisdom of this world think how far God has gone couldn't
01:05:08 -  he have revealed himself in some more honorific way couldn't he have begun by coming in clouds of glory no he begins by coming as infant in a despised city and his whole birth is confused and the Bethlehem the least of the cities of judah and we're in a stable because there's no
01:05:27 -  room at the end from the very advent of his birth God is setting forth another wisdom so we need to be conscious of this or else we'll be eating at the wrong table because the world's values are attractive beguiling seductive their inducements
01:05:45 -  and we need to uh to refrain if we are deeply schooled in the value system which is of God which is to say another wisdom for the whole purpose of the church God has created all things in order that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated before the
01:06:04 -  principalities and the powers of the earth not articulated demonstrated that means we don't we just do not mentally subscribe to them we exhibit them we live by them and we live by them corporately we have separated ourselves from the world's wisdom we don't say that taking care of
01:06:22 -  number one is the first obligation we don't say that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain is a self-evident truth when we know that pain is intrinsic to the faith and that suffering and likely not of them is will be our reward and we see it as reward and not as some grim thing
01:06:39 -  that we may have to bear you see it's a complete reversal but it's the glory of God in this truth uh he obeys because God has said to the jew first and in obeying without understanding or requiring understanding is itself the wisdom of the lord because the world will not move unless it knows
01:06:58 -  unless it understands unless it has knowledge that gives uh an acceptance to this requirement and makes it worthwhile when God called abraham he followed after him not knowing those who follow them with us so ever he goeth do not require an explanation first for where the lord is taking us
01:07:18 -  so just the obedience to the priority to the jew first is itself expressing a wisdom of God which is to say an obedience rendered without having to have it first explained that you might approve it so that you might do it we God does not need our approval all we need is his requirement
01:07:37 -  period and how did my life and God begin with the first statement that God spoke to my asia stick heart on may 22nd 1964 art you are not to leave i had wandered into this messianic bookstore art calling me but he knows me you are not to leave no ifs ends whys buts hows explanations of what
01:08:00 -  that will mean why is that i didn't require i didn't need it i heard the voice of him with whom i have to do my life and God began by obedience without question and that because he's God is wisdom and that's contrary to the wisdom of the world that requires explanation weighing up the
01:08:20 -  the the the the profit and loss line well how about this is against that well if it's makes sense i'll do this that's the wisdom of the world God will call us to that which is unprofitable and and make us candidates not for prosperity but for suffering but because he starts we obey
01:08:38 -  that's another thing the gospel would have been diffused and the labors of the lord distracted if he had acted out of human sentiment or a sense of fair play and listen this is a message of salvation in order to go to the gentiles as well so would you know single-minded absorption the
01:08:57 -  house of Israel only and exclusively why because in the stratagem of God and God's wisdom Israel is the purveyor of God's salvation to the nations and by their restoration the nations are benefited don't think that simple obedience the requirement of God is not going to be tested or tempted
01:09:17 -  by other possibilities that are available to you that make a seeming common good sense and so we have to fight against that no the world has said this no matter what prospects seem to be available so that we're still under that obligation although he has sent us into all the world
01:09:35 -  but preach this gospel in beginning it drew some judia and then to samaria and then to the other most corner of the world so the priority yet remains well yet called to the other most corners of the world but the church has neglected that priority and therefore i feel that the
01:09:50 -  message that has subsequently gone forth in the world has been diffused and has not had the same value and power if we had been obedient on top of that we have signal to the powers of the air that though we say lord lord we are at liberty to censor his requirements or to veto
01:10:07 -  those requirements that did not suit our convenience and that has destroyed our total credibility before the powers of the earth Jesus they know in Paul they know total obedience to God but who are you you that take the liberty to count the man his requirements because it
01:10:22 -  doesn't suit your convenience who are you oh go ahead and have your programs and do you do you this and do you that while we're going in your face so much has been lost by a disobedience to the requirement of God and because we do not require explanation over your being it doesn't
01:10:38 -  mean that there is not an explanation and that there are not reasons why God gives us priority you may have heard me give the example before out of my experience of the high school teacher that every new term i was faced by the bullies in the back of the room usually black who knew that
01:10:53 -  they were going to fail the course from the first day and their only purpose is to torment the teacher and that they're already beginning to harass and i'm faced with a decision of how do i meet them do i have an authority equal to the challenge that they represent or do i choose to
01:11:10 -  ignore it and kind of not hear what they're saying and pick on the lesser expression of insubordination and put them in their place i knew that if i had forfeited that first bully and picked on the lesser i would never have control or authority in that room the whole rest of the
01:11:29 -  year i had to go to the bully first the bully had to be dealt with the authority as a teacher had to be asserted and established and then everything else was going to line the temptation is to avoid the bully because we don't feel equal to the task and then to meet the lesser challenge but you never
01:11:46 -  again have authority over the entire classroom we'll not have it in the world unless we have gone to the bully first and the bully is the jew they are the most notable adversaries they are the strongest in their unction and and vituperation and and bitter opposition and there are reasons to
01:12:06 -  explain that but nevertheless for us it's the most formidable challenge not only in our ability to press through that opposition but to face the brunt of it with equanimity and poise and patience and mercy knowing that the satan has ravaged them and that's so desecrated the name of Jesus
01:12:24 -  that they're brought to a boil at the very mention so we need that testing we need that refinement we've got to pass through what is they alone can bring us even in their unbelief especially in their belief that we might be fitted for the greek as i've cited on many occasions i
01:12:40 -  believe that i have a special ability to discern and to avoid condescensions to things that appear but are not that are sentimental and soulish because i have taken in something on the subject of Israel and the jew that has got to do with the issue of judgment that's when you have made peace
01:13:05 -  and not just reluctantly acknowledge the severe dealings of God with Israel and those that are future but rejoice in them knowing that they are ultimately a mercy it enures you against deceptions that would otherwise be a test for you and the example that i gave and where the lord first
01:13:22 -  revealed this to me was with a couple that we know in sanada who invited me to ottawa through a on indians north american indians and there was wholly a stage performance of mushy sentimentalities of of guilt and conscience of the kind of thing that goes on in germany with jews this was being
01:13:43 -  performed by americans with indians so there are good causes of good grievances that really need to be acknowledged in that the last night was repentance night they set up three or four microphones people could come out of their seats and ask for forgiveness
01:13:57 -  for the injustices perpetrated by their forebears on these indians many people crying including the couple that invited me and i was sitting there like a lump completely unmoved i was totally unaffected what is it i'm impervious to righteous just judgment and to mercy and to brokenness and
01:14:18 -  to confession and to repentance and to reconciliation far from it it's my life why then was i like a lump totally unmoved because everything that was taking place took place in the realm of soul humanly manipulated for people to have a cathartic experience to cry their tears
01:14:34 -  but nothing would be affected and i hear here my host crying on both sides of me and i'm sitting like a lump dry i we're driving home that night and the question would come all right how did you like it tonight also the knowledge you ask i have to tell you i was completely out of it i was
01:14:53 -  completely how come i refer to your interest in indian injustices and reconciliation and yes i am but this was a humanly contrived substitute to affect a kind of sentimental rather than a spirit response and had you waited upon God for the real thing we might have had an
01:15:13 -  event of a of a consequential kind for canada for america but because you pre-empted God in your soulish endeavor we watched it and i was unmoved and i thought well how why was i unmoved and the thought came to me it's because you have submitted to God and his judgments you have taken
01:15:33 -  something of iron into your soul so the judgments of God are the things from for which the flesh must be quarreled and you have not only received you have received them as being ultimate expect statements of God and seeing them as the great mercy of God and subscribe and endorse them
01:15:53 -  with rejoicing and not just reluctantly and somehow to do that brings a quotient that a dimension into our inner man that serves to repel and for us to discern sentimentality and soulish things that we would not otherwise have seen it and to be unmoved by it something has come into us
01:16:13 -  and i believe that that's not just a personal thing for me but God's intention for all the church that the church can be duped and susceptible to counterfeit things for it has not bitten the bullet of God as judge and God in judgment which is daniel's name and we need to
01:16:36 -  um not only receive God's judgments but in fact before the ages over and earlier to proclaim them so values infuse life with a steady sense of direction and purpose they free us from the petty
01:16:53 -  dictatorships of fashion and fad and free us to pour ourselves out into larger goals for higher purposes the gospel keeps us in touch with sane and healthy values the gospel is the issue in fact of sanity itself we need to recognize what is implicit in our message a life-saving message
01:17:16 -  that if men do not receive it in power Paul said that you received the word of God for me as not being a member of God that performed a work in you and that it came in power because it has to come in power because it confronts attacks and controversial an entire
01:17:36 -  system of values to which the world subscribes which is insanity and death do we believe that and can we proclaim this so the claim of the gospel is that it puts us in touch with reality all of it not just the part it's not a narrow religious message it's the issue of reality
01:17:59 -  which is all-inclusive and takes in everything to miss it here is to miss it everywhere and if there's if nebuchadnezzar could make an acknowledgement of God that most christians have not yet made in the beginning of chapter four and yet it was not real for him through and through
01:18:15 -  what is the condition of the church in general that makes its confessions and its acknowledgments as its credos and its and so on if have they been any more sincere and deep and authentic in their appropriation of the truth of God they never can answer and for that reason what gospel
01:18:35 -  have they proclaimed and what gospel was proclaimed in japan that has only affected less than one percent of the entire nation completely without any consciousness of sin who are taking the liberty now of writing their history books in such a way as to exempt the truth of what japan performed
01:18:52 -  in world war two as brutality and horror upon its victims because the greater issue is not truth but patriotism i can read you the article i cooked out of a newspaper in japan that country needs the gospel but it needs the gospel of the kind that the lord is fingering here and must come in
01:19:11 -  power because you're opposing an entire world system predicated upon a lie and the end of which is insanity and death even while people live let alone in their eternity if we knew the victims that are in mental institutions if we knew the statistics of the broken homes the marriages the
01:19:31 -  the grotesque things that have shattered entire generations of our youth my God they are the victims of a world that has not heard the message of God in power but the world is really insane and what have we seen with the conduct of the world but it supports it at least uh the yugoslavia
01:19:48 -  serbia uh croatia the um country i'm going to i keep to get on albania albania ethnic cleansing with without conscience graveyards mass graveyards of men women and children who could be murdered in view of a value of of ethnic cleansing is insanity to take life is insanity to murder
01:20:13 -  is insanity and men are doing it what's the word without a blink of the eyelash without emotion without conscience because they're insane and yet the men of of that kind will receive world acknowledgement world honor because the whole world lies in the wicked one who is the father
01:20:34 -  of lies what is the proclamation of the gospel with that very God suffered the judgment that is our due and was made to be less than other than a man he was marred more than any man he was bestialized he was made animal like that when you see that great who has the cover of that
01:20:56 -  the masterpiece of the crucifixion of Jesus you wonder whether you're looking at a man or an animal holy ghost masterpiece more than any man and so this is God's judgment on unrighteousness and sin to save mankind from the necessity itself to bear that judgment for nothing that they could
01:21:19 -  sacrifice would be acceptable to God and that the sins of japan can be met at the cross because God himself was the land see the whole gospel begins to take on dimensions of a deeper kind when we understand what is at stake and what is being expressed in that message because the
01:21:41 -  claim of the gospel is that it puts us in touch with reality this garish bizarre sight of a destroyed God man is the foundation of reality and his reality itself for those who look upon it steadily like beholding the snake of grass and if you look up you'll be saved from the bite of sin and of
01:22:01 -  death all of it not just the part the whole gospel isn't interesting that we have a movement in our generation called the full gospel businessmen the full gospel well i'm still at odds with a family and believers in north carolina where i was the guest of the president of the local branch of the
01:22:19 -  full gospel and was invited to the meeting a monthly meeting that took place the night of my arrival not as a speaker just and it was agony it was full of charade a play out for them pump everyone's possibility that night when i spoke in his house and i knew the lord was love gospel
01:22:37 -  is a charade it's a play acting it's an in-house celebration but it has no corresponding reality where it really counts where men are dying and need to hear the word of God in power i lost all my i lost my friends that way and i was told i had burned the bridges behind me i had violated
01:22:55 -  southern value of respect for your host you don't say things like that i was going for both life and death was at stake not only for what would issue from this but their own life imagine a man dying thinking he had served God and he was playing a game all the while
01:23:16 -  and had never any consequence for his community subsequently that man contracted cancer here's putting a little salt into the wound and we prayed for his deliverance and as we prayed and considered the thought came to me i shared it with our fellowship in the morning prayer time
01:23:35 -  i wonder if that cancer is in any way related to the rejection both of the message and the messenger all those months ago claiming that it was not of God and that it was rude and unmanly and could not be God and so do i send a letter to suggest that maybe you want to consider
01:23:55 -  that your cancer is not some kind of accidental phenomenon but somehow the door has been opened to this by an unrighteous rejection both of God's word and God's messenger and i'm not saying thus say of the lord but i can but i want to offer it at least as a possibility lest you should die in
01:24:13 -  that sin and then learn on the other side of eternity that that was the cause so would you have written that letter knowing that that would keep um offense and that that would be a last straw for those people art was bad enough the last time but now to suggest that my husband's cancer is a
01:24:35 -  consequence of sinful rejection when we saw it as a heroic testimony over doctors and nurses in the hospital because he was going to overcome this by the way he died and we did send that letter was a response from family never heard a word back but you can pray for me because at the
01:24:50 -  end of this trip that begins in albania albania goes on to germany and uh holland and then ends south carolina i'm invited to be a guest in her home again wow and i'm going to charles newt where there's also been offense over the years and you mean and Paul gorton who i spoke a message on
01:25:14 -  resurrection where he got up and he said this is the word of the lord for us and when i got home there's a three page or five page letter of condemnation for that same word comes the same brother who himself now is living uh in shadow of death with tubes and oxygen and heart condition
01:25:30 -  i'll be his house guest also she's a lifelong friend it's not just offending southern sensibilities this woman once wanted to be my secretary the first ben Israel television programs were produced in Durham North Carolina through this woman and her contacts we've had a long history this is like
01:25:51 -  biting the hand that has fed you for years and yet it was a word of truth that had to be expressed for which i was accused of arrogance by a brother who was with me in traveling at that time later on has since left us accused me of arrogance but where was he when i was on my face between
01:26:09 -  four and five in the morning filling uh cleenexes with my tears knowing the kind of word i would have to bring that night it's a little episode of what it means to proclaim the prophetic word and go for broke and we are being
