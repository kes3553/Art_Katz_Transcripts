God of the Nations 1

00:00 -  ...continuous of something building from the flood, from Noah, from the remarkable prophecies over his sons, and then it gives Chapter 10 the whole genealogy of those nations that issue from three sons, the nations themselves issue from the three progenitors of all mankind,
00:29 -  and then Chapter 11 is the Tower of Babel, the nations from the beginning evidencing a spirit of rebellion and arrogance against God, doing their own thing, establishing their own location, not where God intended, but wanting to exalt themselves above God, building
00:53 -  not of stone, but of bricks that they could bake and fabricate synthetically and artificially and put together with slime. Boy, if that's not a formula for the labor of men seeking to glorify that and exalt themselves above God, I don't know what is. But the Lord looked
01:14 -  out and saw it and was concerned and saw what their intention was, to make a name for themselves and to exalt themselves above God, and he confounded their language and dispersed them. So the configuration of nations today, where they are located, and the strange language
01:32 -  they speak, like Danish, is altogether the judgment, as anyone who will hear the language will readily agree, of the nations and dispersed. And ever since, there's been a propensity of the nations, again, to formulate themselves as an entity unto themselves and for themselves
01:56 -  and make a name for themselves in such enterprises as the United Nations, the League of Nations, etc., etc. So there's the whole, can you see the progression? The sons of Noah, the nations that issue from them, the cryptic statement of God that his salvation for the nations
02:17 -  has somehow to do with this mystical tent of Shem, but of course the nations who are rebellious will not heed God's provision, but seek their own. And they saw it in the Torah Bible, he brings it to naught, and then at the end of chapter 11, we read about Shem's,
02:39 -  the descendants of Shem, from verse 10, of which one is Eber, from whom the Hebrews come, and then the descendants, a man by the name of Terah, in verse 26, the father of Abraham, and then the genealogy of Terah begetting Abraham, and so on, and Lot, and then they
03:05 -  took wives, and the chapter ends with the conclusion of the life of this Terah. Chapter 12 then begins with a Semitic son of Terah named Abram, to whom comes a distinctive call, and that call is in response to the rebellion of nations. I don't know if you've ever understood,
03:30 -  but you need to understand the advent of Abraham is not just to give rise to the church or perform other of the redemptive and precious purposes of God. It has as its essential and first purpose as to count to measure God's antidote to the rebellion of nations. From this one man,
03:51 -  he will form a nation that will bless all the nations and bless all the families of the earth, and bring them into that alignment with that Semitic nub that will heal their propensity toward rebellion, arrogance, conceit, and self-sufficiency, which has been the undoing
04:12 -  of mankind, especially in our own century. So we need to see Abraham as God's provision against the Tower of Babel, the rebellion of nations, and that God would make his name great. Let's look at the call of Abraham. Get out of your country and from your family. Get out of
04:34 -  your nation. In order to be a father of nations, you've got to come out of your own, not just physically, but in every way in which nationality and national identity might have its hook in you, because I'm going to do in you something altogether unique. You're going to represent
04:53 -  something above and beyond all nations. You're going to establish a nation for all nations, and you can't come to that possibility of bringing anything of your own antecedents, of your own culture and origin. You've got to come out from your nation, kindred, and father's house.
05:15 -  If you ever want a depiction of the cross, it's right there. This is the first powerful setting forth of the cross in its totality. We're called sons of Abraham. We're sons of Abraham. Then it's contingent upon us to have heard that call and received it for our own,
05:34 -  and to come out with the same radical totality with which Abraham was called. We still linger in our nationality even as Jews. We're still not in the Abrahamic place. So that's not my subject. I don't want to dwell on that just to tease you a little bit and
05:55 -  have you to dote upon it at your own leisure. If you'll do that, that the first principle of God is radical separation totality. It comes by God taking the initiative with one man, Abraham. There's all kinds of speculation as to what kind of man he might be, that he was already chafed
06:19 -  by the idolatry of his own civilization or of the Chaldeans, and God saw a potential candidate for himself. That's all speculation. Nobody knows. It could just be the very sovereign choice of God to pick a man, maybe not because he showed propensity, but because he had none,
06:39 -  just like the choice of Israel, just like the choice of us. When you get down to it, not because of our distinction, but the lack of distinction, that he might be all in all, for of him and through him and through him are all things to whom be glory forever.
06:55 -  So probably seeing the way God characteristically works, Abraham probably had no distinction that would qualify him for selection and for choice. God begins by choosing and calling a man, but he is a Semite. He is a son of Shem. He is derived from that line of descent and genealogy,
07:16 -  and he must be because what will be formed of him has got to be a fulfillment of what Noah had already spoken about that one son, Shem. So you can't get away from that, folks. We don't want to get away from it. We want to get more deeply into it, for it's the heart of the
07:32 -  mystery. So I will make you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you. I will curse him who curses you. And in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed or all the nations of the world.
07:52 -  God's intention from the very first in the great redemptive saga or drama that the Germans call Heil's Geschichte, salvation history, is the intent of God for the nations. God so loved the world that he gave us only begotten some. His love for the world and for the nations, rebellious though
08:15 -  they are, stinking and arrogant though they are, full of conceit and contempt for God, full of blasphemy, he's still a lover of the nations. For he made of one blood all nations of men and established their bounds and habitations that they might seek after God if happily they might
08:32 -  be found of him. Where am I quoting? Acts 17. Acts 17, Paul's address at Athens, which the theologians say was Paul's single boo-boo. He didn't evangelize and was drawn off to become philosophical and speculative and speak about the purpose of God for the nations.
08:55 -  Whew. So much for theologians. Those theologians. Actually it was a great address and they told men who were every day looking for some new thing and some novelty what the whole purpose of life is, to be found of God.
09:14 -  That's the purpose of which God has given of one blood all nations, their bounds, their habitations. We've got to understand the design of God. He's the creator. He has created the nations. This world, the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof and the nations and those that
09:33 -  dwell therein. Believers found that? Psalm 24. Where else would you find it? The world, the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof and the nations and those that dwell therein. He's the God of the nations. The thing that's distinctive about the Old Testament and Israel
09:56 -  is that what is different about them and all of the other pagan civilizations around them in the Near East is that their God is not a tribal deity. Their God is not the God of fertility for whom they can put up a phallic symbol to have temple prostitutes in order to placate
10:17 -  that demonic entity and have abundant promise. Israel's God is different from all the other Gods. He's not a local deity. He's not to be placated. He's the God of all the earth. He's the creator and the Lord of all nations. That's the flying ointment. That's why Israel is hated
10:39 -  and despised because what she represents even in her present unbelief in apostasy is a threat to all nations who want to continue in their autonomy and independence from God and from his rule. So first we'll go to Psalm 96 and we can go to many Psalms
10:59 -  and see how this theme is expressed by the psalmist in many places. And what he's singing and celebrating and commemorating is the historic faith of Israel, the faith of the psalmist, the faith of the prophets, the faith of the patriarchs of Moses.
11:21 -  Psalm 96. Oh, sing to the Lord a new song. Sing to the Lord all the earth to mark that. Every reference in this psalm that goes beyond the issue of Israel itself and touches the larger purpose of God through Israel. Israel is not an entity unto itself or for itself, nor was Abraham.
11:43 -  I will make you the father of many nations. In Romans 4 it says he would be made the father of the world. No wonder that a perverted and unregenerate mind can take that and turn it into a Zionist conspiracy where Jews want to take over. Can you see? It doesn't take much
12:05 -  to bring a warp to the divine intention of God and make it a hideous kind of thing that will excite anti-Semitic hatred. What it is is Satan bringing the twist and bringing the warp, but that God's actual intention is that the nations would come under that tent of shem,
12:26 -  under the Semitic oversight of God through the people appointed who are the descendants of Abraham. So we need to understand the drama. Why? Because it's going on still and we're going to be witnesses and participants to its final enactment where the evil one, knowing that his time is short,
12:47 -  will ventilate his wrath, foaming at the mouth to seek to avert the catastrophe of losing control over the world. Jesus said the prince of this world comes, but he has nothing in me. He acknowledged that there is a prince of this world
13:03 -  and he wants to remain prince and he's got his his lieutenants and subordinates and the whole network of political influence in the in the air over nations called the principalities and powers of the air. If you want to read one of the most incisive and broad examinations of that phenomenon,
13:33 -  get the book Apostolic Foundations. It's worth the price of the whole book. I don't know anyone else who has that comprehension and ability and has set forth so incisively that subject as the author of that book who is the holy ghost. There's a war on saints and we may not recognize it. It
14:04 -  seems like it's low key at least for us here. In other places the bombs are bursting. Why is it that the time of Jacob's trouble will be a greater bloodletting and a greater annihilation of Jews than the Nazi Holocaust? I was tempted to pipe in less and I didn't want any way to distract
14:25 -  from Reggie when somehow at the end the question came up about what survival would there be in Israel and Reggie rightly quoted two-thirds will perish, one-third will remain and be brought through the fire. And what I say just speculatively, not thus say of the Lord,
14:45 -  but it has everything to commend it, if two-thirds in Israel will perish, what will be the ratio of survival and annihilation elsewhere in the world for Jews? If that same ratio holds true in the land or out of land and there are roughly 15 million Jews in the world, 10 million will perish
15:02 -  in the time of Jacob's trouble. In a shorter period of time than the Nazi process of the final solution that ran from 1938 to 1945, seven years, half that time a double amount, almost 12 million will be annihilated somewhere not just confined to Europe but worldwide.
15:25 -  It's going to take some moral stamina on our part to be present in the earth and not hold God accountable and not be grieved or disappointed at his failure to preserve the state and the nation and to preserve his people. But he says I will bring you out of all nations wherein you,
15:43 -  you rebels who transgress against me and express your transgression by saying this shall not come upon us, I'll bring you out of the nations wherein you have sojourned but I will not bring you into the land. They're going to be graveyards and bodies and cast out like dung over the earth.
16:06 -  Only a remnant will survive called the redeemed of the Lord that returned to Zion with mourning and sighing fleeing the way. Not only for the loss of their state but the loss of their relatives, the loss of their fathers, their uncles, their boobas and their zetas, grandfathers and grandmothers.
16:25 -  But they'll be everlasting joy for they shall not again be plucked up and rooted out. I will plant them under them is a remarkable, what's the word for that plant, simile, metaphor, that's the word. Planting is so gracious, so gentle, the great husband. What would we call
16:52 -  Zionist Israel? Certainly not a planting, more a rude, usurping, a grasping, more like Jacob than it is Israel. And so how can that be the nation that will bless all the families of the earth? How can it bless when it is not itself blessed? Jacob had to become Israel in order
17:15 -  to have his own altar and place of worship before the God of his fathers and so must this present nation equally. There's going to be very great nutrition. That's why Jesus said if this time were not cut short no flesh would survive. But for the elect's sake this time will be cut short.
17:35 -  He said this is going to be a greater trouble than the nation has ever known from its inception and will not again know. And I'm disputing with men who have reputations that are international who say that that is past tense, that's already taken place, that that was the Nazi Holocaust
17:56 -  and that present Israel need not fear another catastrophe of that kind. Well then how come Jesus says it has to begin in Jerusalem with the abomination of desolation, let those who read understand and flee to the mountains of Judah, pray that it doesn't come on
18:14 -  the Sabbath. Every indication is that it has its inception in the land. Nazi Holocaust had its inception in Europe. So if this is yet future and a greater trouble than the nation has ever known it must then exceed the Nazi Holocaust. That's why they're going to come to us so beat up,
18:36 -  so completely demoralized, so suddenly uprooted, so disheveled that they'll not be on their best behavior. They'll not be cute. They'll be loathsome. They'll be bitter. They'll be spitting out their vexations because they'll think that the whole thing is the fault of Christianity.
18:53 -  That's how they interpret the Holocaust past. After all it issued out of Lutheran Germany out of Luther's own incitement. How will we receive them? With what grace? When God says the whole issue is that in the
19:11 -  wilderness of the nations they will meet with me face to face and there come unto the rod of my unto the bunt of my covenant the Lord of my authority that they might return as redeemed to the Lord though they didn't leave in that condition. The whole issue is what kind of face
19:29 -  greets them in the wilderness of the nations. Who's in the wilderness with them? In Isaiah 35 when it says that the wilderness will be glad for them but will we be glad for them and they will be dispirited and broken and desolate. Have you ever been in the wilderness
19:47 -  where you've never been before? I've only recently come from it in Mexico. We spent the night in the wilderness and I'll tell you what it's not too cheery frightening but I was with a Mexican brother who knew the location so I wasn't rattled but if I was there in ignorance not knowing what tomorrow
20:10 -  would bring a way to go and everything is desolate there's no water and stifling fierce heat this is what Jews will be going through but someone in Isaiah 35 is addressed who is not Israel and says say to them your God will come
20:27 -  and when they hear that the blind eyes are open and the lame leap and water breaks out of dry ground praise God there's someone there who can speak a prophetic word your God will come when there's no evidence of this coming it's got to take prophetic faith to believe for that
20:49 -  according to the scripture and our own prophetic experience with God who has come for us at times of our own desolation in our wilderness experience mark that statement okay sing to the Lord all the earth blessing to the Lord bless his name proclaim the good news of
21:11 -  the salvation from day to day declare his glory among the nations his wonders among all peoples how inclusive that is for the Lord is great and greatly to be praised he's to be feared above all Gods small g for all the Gods of the peoples are idols but the Lord made the heavens and we can
21:36 -  add the earth honor and majesty are before him strength and duty are in the sanctuary are in the sanctuary God's right to rule is predicated upon God being created the earth is the words and therefore what he created and what is his he has every right to
21:55 -  govern the basis for his authority in his will is his creatorship that's why we see references to God as creator it's song after song after song Israel knows that this God is not a local tribal deity its God is the God of all creation the very creator himself do we know it have you realized
22:23 -  what an assault that has been in our generation of upon God as creator what do you think evolution is all about that is taught in the schools as if it's science that anyone who dares to suggest that there's another way of understanding the world that's been created that guy is out
22:46 -  and so what has become conventional wisdom and they're looking for the the pilt-bound man and some other missing link that will show that man has evolved from lower primates and prove their theory somehow they're never able to come up with that final proof of course they've got the carbon
23:02 -  dating system that they can show that what they have found goes back millions of years and so there can can't be said that man has only a 6 000 year history but they're forgetting that God can create old
23:19 -  is anything impossible to him I know even to stupefy the wisdom of men right right and he'll give them all the evidence they want to confirm their their atheism until they'll stand before the creator one day and their knees
23:34 -  will turn to jelly all their hot shot assumptions will go up in a puff and they stand before the creator and king at his throne who is a lone judge well we need to know dear saints there's been an erosion for us we don't subscribe to evolution but it's in the air our kids bring it
23:57 -  home from school we read it in magazines it's the unspoken premise and assumption of our generation so we have to the degree that that has had a corrosive effect upon us we have lost the sense of God as creator it needs to be restored it's foundational to the issue of his rulership
24:17 -  he rules because he creates and he judges because he rules all of those three things are in tandem but if we lose the first we lose the rest we have not an abiding and deep and profound sense of God the creator of the heavens and the earth and all that in them is the rest is not followed
24:35 -  except verbally it's not really with deepest conviction as the psalmist knew it as the prophets knew it as all Israel once knew it and needs to know it again i will not know it except the church he used to be feared above all Gods for all the Gods of the people are idols but the lord made
25:02 -  or created the heavens honor and majesty are beforehand strength and beauty are in his sanctuary give to the lord oh families of the peoples give to the lord glory and strength give to the lord the glory do his name bring an offering come into his courts of course where
25:18 -  will he have to come to do that you're not going to do it in geneva or new york city you're going to have to come to his courts you have to come to his location to the house that is intended a house of prayer for all nations which is only another statement of the tenth of shim
25:37 -  you have to come to the place where he has designated for he is in that place alone and if you're paying homage to him oblation and sacrifice to him that's the place where you'll come and there's a priestly people there to receive you and receive your offerings
25:53 -  uh whose skirts you will clutch because they know your God and will take you to him bring an offering and come into his court so worship the lord and the beautiful and struggle before him all the earth the psalmist are always crying out that his praise might be
26:11 -  sounded to the ends of the earth we have to travel a little bit to the ends of the earth to understand hebraic faith the most degraded places of the earth full of pagans and idols and hindu temples and every demoralizing thing that can rise up out of the brave man God says in
26:34 -  that place my praise will be sounded and the psalmist believed that the prophets believed that and understood how much that will be contended against by the powers of the air that want to keep men in bondage to false Gods for they are the the the Gods of this age
26:56 -  what will they do then to pick up where left off before to avert the threat of their loss of governmental influence and rule you say don't tell me that's some invisible spirit phenomenon called the principality powers of the air can actually affect government
27:12 -  as society in the earth of course you silly sap what do you think they're just hoping they are the most profound influence they're jerking and dangling entire nations and societies by strings you can't understand present-day genocide in
27:31 -  africa rwanda and and this one and that one and what took place with serbia the ethnic cleansing that that destructive pride national pride that sees the enemy to be eliminated and it's women and girls raped as an instrument of warfare without understanding the influence of those
27:50 -  problems you can't understand punk rock culture or any of the idolatries of our age without understanding their influence they are powerful Paul himself said if the if the rulers of this world knew they would not have crucified the lord of glory he's not talking about pontius pilate
28:10 -  the rulers of this world are the invisible spectral realm of fallen angels whose prince is saint and they want to remain in control you say art they may influence but they certainly can't take over what do you call nazi journey that's the land of girder schiller fichte hagel
28:30 -  nichi schopenhauer con Wagner come on you can help me with composers with philosophers with writers with with the genius of culture and western civilization honed to its finest edge and boom within the space of months some gutter snipe some despicable or cultic jerk
28:52 -  who who couldn't get beyond the corporals stripes and failed to enter into art school and is just a kind of kind of cast off of society became chancellor and ruler over the entire nation and set in motion a series of ethics by which demonic tyranny settled upon a whole people
29:14 -  who is the nation of girder schiller fichte hagel how long will it take in america that's our culture the civilization that it was thousands of years in the making deep that's why jews didn't want to leave they said how could this scummy guy succeed the nation will come
29:30 -  through its census there's no place for men like that in rulership we'll hold tight after all uncle so-and-so fought in world war one and received the iron cross we jews are royal germans in fact we're more german than we are jew those same ones went up the smokestack
29:48 -  and evil prevailed over those powers because the only agency in the world and in nations given of God both to recognize that demonic identity entity and to combat it and to defeat it is the church but the church of what kind the church that is steeped in the scriptures steeped
30:11 -  in the songs steeped in the understanding of God as creator king and ruler over all and knows the fierce contest going on between two princes that this is the whole parameter and context of our faith if we don't know that we're condemned to a series of sunday services
30:32 -  our whole christian life becomes provincial narrow selfish an issue of enjoyment but when the when the structure of the faith is cosmically established a struggle that will have its final culmination in our generation then are we alerted then are we brought into the context by which
30:52 -  everything is is made clear the holy spirit then is no longer luxury or a denominational distinctive it's God's profound gift to function and to serve in an age of ultimate comfort where we need the gift of prophecy and wisdom knowledge to guide us where we've not been here before
31:18 -  we need to come into the context of the faith that God intended as normative and which we have lost in modern times for which reason God raises up this pathetic little thing called school of the prophets not to make them but to bring us back again into the prophetic
31:38 -  understanding of the context of life and reality and given the wisdom of these powers which is destructive and chaotic they understand the jews to be a greater threat to their false usurping continuance than we know yes you could explain anti-semitism to a degree
32:01 -  sociologically culturally historically but you'll not you'll not understand it fully and deeply until you understand the the bitterness and the hatred against a people who if they are redeemed and returned to the lord and to the land in covenantal faithfulness bring their king and
32:22 -  his rule and the end of their false usurping power how do you get rid of that threat you annihilated and that's how we're going to see all of the unregenerate elements available to those powers after jews were the venom and they'll say about jews what what Paul's enemy said about him
32:44 -  they're not fit to live read this literature see the venom against men who who are just acting civilly and being called jew lovers and will hang you from the nearest lamppost you're despicable you want to preserve the people we want to annihilate
33:08 -  so verse 10 say among the nations the lord reigns even now when it doesn't give that appearance the world also is firmly established it shall not be moved he shall judge the peoples righteously a king who rules and the king who judges
33:27 -  let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar in all its fullness the sea is always symbolic of the nations the rage of the seas and the tumult and the noise the crashing waves the power it helps to be on a liberty ship as a 16 year old kid
33:46 -  uh standing at the bow watching for minds yet remaining from world war two and and feel like a little court popping up and down in tumultuous seas to know the power of the seas and why they represent the nations and the rage and the fury of the nations against God
34:07 -  where with under the havoc of those waves the ship listing to such a degree that we took water into our smokestack and they sent up this jewish idealistic kid who wrote poetry and wanted adventure to travel in the world to tie up the block and tackle that had
34:26 -  broken loose from the mask that weighs about at least two tons with a rope hoping that i would fall off and into the sea because the bosun's mate which is the master sergeant was a swedish alcoholic and anti-semite who hated my guts as a jewish kid looking for adventure
34:47 -  that i'm here with you today is only by the grace of God who knew me and that i was elect before i had dreamed of his existence for i was an atheist in those days i'm being reminded of the sense that i had as a cork bobbing on the sea those liberty
35:05 -  ships were built by kaiser factories but you guys don't know there was a kaiser frazer car that came out right after the war and now it's extinct they built these liberty ships with women welders oh and it's not unusual for them to pop their rivets i'm not blaming the women God
35:28 -  but God never intended them to be riveters and welders so you feel absolutely defenseless and at the mercy of the elements raging seas and that's what the psalmist is saying let the heavens rejoice let the earth be glad let the sea
35:53 -  roar its old vein that they make a lot of noise but that shall not threaten the purposes of God but let the field be joyful and all that is in it then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the lord for he is coming for he is coming to judge the earth he shall judge the world with
36:14 -  righteousness and the peoples with his truth so from where will he judge them and when will he judge them when he comes as king in the very same place where he was crucified where over his head in three languages was the taunting mocking sign Jesus and nazareth king
36:36 -  of the jews ha ha ha and they put a purple robe on him and they braided a crown of thorns and they gave him a staff everything to mock any reference to himself as king he bore that with complete equanimity patience and grace what he knew that that was indeed his call
37:00 -  that's what the word messiah means is anointed king came to his own in his own receipt is the father going to allow that to be the last statement in history or if you know anything about God and how he vindicates his sons will he not give him in the
37:18 -  place of his greatest humility the place of his greatest glory in the place where he was defamed and mocked will he not in fact be king in that place and not only to his own people but to all nations we've got to know the end from the beginning we've got to know to which where all
37:37 -  things are attending and how it will be mightily resisted by every power of darkness who dread this conclusion that's why they crucified him they wanted to crucify the king and get Israel to say we have no king but caesar give us barabbas we rather have a thief and a murderer will not have
37:58 -  that man to rule over us oh yeah we'll see what that's going to cost you if you'll not have that mental worldview you'll have a greater tyrant he'll extract much and that king will wait to hear from you blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord
38:21 -  so pray for the best expression of our contemporary jewish life the rubavitcher chassid and the ultra-orthodox of oakland waiting for the resurrection of rabbi schnitzel they think he's the king there are big billboards in Israel and in new york
38:39 -  with his face and white beard and hebrew and in english saying the messiah king and when i was with them on one recent occasion i said how can a man be messiah and king there's only one king it's the lord of glory it's the God of Israel is the lone king how can you say a man
38:59 -  is king well what i didn't know is that under their breath they believe he is deity so we're so deranged so wanting uh sound biblical messianic understanding so exalting a man that they're willing to ascribe to him deity this is the people to whom i'm coming
39:25 -  because if that man can be exalted then they can be exalted in their humanity so let's look at the great song that establishes the king that is altogether eschatological that is God's statement against the fury and rage of nations of what he will and has established
39:51 -  and that song is song two an american theologian some of us had the privilege of hearing recently in in uh my old seminary there in st Paul walter bruggemann also of german descent he's a he's an old testament and a commentator theologian of the old testament this is his
40:16 -  classic work and he says over the long haul of the enlightenment western christianity has been progressively privatized in terms of individuals families and domestic communities by and large out of bewilderment
40:38 -  and embarrassment the ecclesial community's church have forgotten how to speak about national and international matters except in times of war to mobilize God for the war effort the inevitable outcome of this privatization is to give up a relinquish geopolitics to practical
40:59 -  technical analysis of the cynical kind that stalin commented about how many divisions does the pope have like what what does religion have to do or christianity have to do with earthly matters of rule or governments or nations their christians are sunday matter and that has come
41:22 -  with the whole privatized christianity and the faith that has been domesticated and lost all sense that we're in a world and there are purposes of God in the world in fact the faith is given for those purposes from abraham in the answers that were written in the nations to the establishment
41:40 -  of the king in the holy hill of zion that we'll be reading in psalm two and we've been reading a lot out of this and he speaks fancy he speaks theologically so i'm going to try and interpret that the church has forgotten how to speak about national and
41:58 -  international matters except in times of war to mobilize God for the war effort that if the theological dimension drops out of international purview and with it any credible critical moral dimension then the world becomes one in which might makes right that's fancy language to say
42:18 -  if the church loses this consciousness and acts and relinquishes its influence that God intends for it in the world and in the nations and the nations take it over and completely secularize the issues of politics and government and rule then in the last analysis the church is going to
42:40 -  in the last analysis the world becomes one in which might makes right it's only the church that has a moral dimension to bring to the consideration of nations and if you've not read the newsletter available at the table there it's the message given in Israel to a messianic
42:58 -  congregation about the role of the church the prophetic function of the church to the state and if the church does not function does not take on this responsibility what shall you expect the state to perform it will always do the expedient thing the thing that will accomplish its ends
43:17 -  it doesn't allow moral consideration to interfere with what they consider to be necessary and functional only a church can bring a moral dimension to the consideration of nations and if the moral dimension is lost to the nations what do the nations necessarily become
43:36 -  but battlefields and gross places of sin and darkness so he's saying and in keeping with this other commentator that the loss of this awareness and the spiritualizing of scripture and the way in which our christianity has become privatistic and personal has
44:02 -  meant a critical loss in our comprehension of all the faith and the kind of role that God intends for the church in the world if the characteristic urging of Israel's prophets that arrogant nations which overreach
44:26 -  and imagine self-sufficiency operate autonomously at their own peril yalway in this rhetoric is a critical principle of restraint which arrests both self-aggrandizement and brutality don't get scared i'm going to paraphrase because it's worth hearing what's on this man's mind
44:45 -  it is the characteristic urging of Israel's prophets that arrogant nations which overreach themselves because they distance themselves from God and think themselves self-sufficient and operate autonomously do so at their own peril when the lord comes at judge what does he judge
45:05 -  he judges the nations in their sinfulness in their bestiality in their arrogance in their power in their sinfulness in their bestiality in their arrogance in their power in their criminality now the world is first trying to bring to judgment this serbian ruler in the in the international
45:25 -  court of war in the hag but i don't think they're going to succeed very well we're going to have to wait for the justice and judgment that comes from God when he judges the nations and the principle judgment is the forsaking of him therefore acting in their own arrogance in
45:40 -  their own self-sufficiency and justifying themselves on national grounds have steeped the world in bloodshed and ruined entire generations as well as the earth itself but it was Israel's prophets that urged this consideration that God intends a principle of
46:01 -  restraint what is my statement about the tenth of shem that the japheth nations bowing to enter would receive something in that tent that is not available to them anywhere else the spirit of restraint the spirit of governance the moral quotient that that makes the difference
46:20 -  between the nation that becomes bestial and a nation which is civilized and is concerned about and takes into consideration the rights of men the helpless the orphans the broken that's that's God's provision for japheth nations who are enlarged the name of japheth enlarged
46:40 -  powerful commercial military left to their own arrogance that's a formula for disaster that's what history has taught us what's God's answer that they should come up to jerusalem that they should hang on to the skirt of a jew who will teach them the words of the lord
46:58 -  that they should hang on to the skirt of a jew who will teach them the words of the lord maybe uh let's just look quickly in isaiah chapter two who's who's speaking this the prophets who's speaking it now the prophets this is prophetic concern and prophetic urgency
47:18 -  uh but what have we done with isaiah too the same that we've done with psalm two we have spiritualized its literal meaning away
47:35 -  the word that isaiah the son of amos saw concerning jude and ruslim that shall come to pass in the latter days in the last days that the mountain of the lord's house the word mountain is always symbolic of government and rule shall be established on the top of the mountains
47:52 -  and shall be exalted above the hills that is to say zion and jerusalem shall be the prevailing rule over not only juda but over all nations it will be above the mountains and the hills of human governments and all nations shall flow to it the same theme as in psalm 96 all nations
48:17 -  to the ends of the earth this must come into our consciousness as the prophetic church that the whole intention of God's salvation history is all nations the world he so loved the world he is he called the man abram out of a nation and that through him all the nations and the
48:38 -  families of air shall be blessed how shall they be blessed they shall come up to Jerusalem they shall come into the tenth of shim they shall learn of God and of his ways come let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the God of jacob interesting the identification not
48:54 -  some abstract deity but Israel's specific literal God and this is where the fly is in the ointment where men don't mind some general reference to God but when it gets this close to jews the God of jacob they get a little edgy and that's exactly the point this is the stumbling
49:15 -  stone in zion for gentiles who don't want to acknowledge the specificity of God in the choosing of a people and a nation and and a location a zion attempt a shem and in order to receive the benefit they cannot enter except they bow
49:36 -  and that's exactly what they refuse to do for arrogance characterizes jay fifth nations from the tower of babel to this present day even when they're saved and all nations shall flow to it many people shall come and say come let us go up to the
49:53 -  mountain of the lord to the house of the God of jacob he will teach us his ways and that means torah torah is not a code of legal requirement torah is the all-inclusive word for teaching for the revelation of God's way
50:14 -  for out of zion shall go forth the law the torah that dictates the lord is not going to become a dictator and the word of the lord from jerusalem he shall judge between the nations we're not going to have any more catastrophes like rwanda or serbia and croatia and i always forget the name
50:37 -  of this other people albania the albanians in kosovo it's a bloodletting this ethnic cleansing this national ambition to root out the enemy the remarkable thing is that ethnically they are the same slavic people but historically they had become muslims in the invasion in four centuries
50:58 -  ago and retain that character and so there's been warfare bloodshed enmity rape and vengeance and until the lord himself shall judge between the nations when we say come lord Jesus this is what we ought to be thinking and meaning and rebuke many people they shall beat their swords into
51:19 -  plowshares their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore there's no commentator who can do that justice and and hint at what that will mean to the world economy to what has been diverted to instruments of death
51:39 -  will it be diverted now to those things that forward life and not death there are children dying by the carload every moment for want of nutrition for disease for the most elemental things that nations cannot afford but they can afford the implements of warfare i often talk
51:57 -  about my privileged visit to the douglas aircraft plant in fort worth texas nearby where they make the f-16 fighter bombers never forget the experience of seeing what this means beating swords into plowshares and each one is like a billion dollars 25 million i don't know what
52:20 -  some astronomical sum and men who do not look human working overtime and making were splendid salaries in order to fit these things together they lost i look i was stunned the lord gave me the word gnomes g-n-o-m-e-s i've never ever spoken of thought that word it's a stunted humanity
52:40 -  because when you invest your life to produce death it's going to affect your person and i'm pleading with this brother who who works there as an engineer to find some other source of employment but the security and the benefits are overwhelming it's the the world is predicated
52:58 -  on death and and profits that issue from it and i'm looking at the planes and it says burma or whatever burma's new name now is and some other pakistan and nations that that don't even have a pot to urinate in and a window to throw it out of are buying these 25 million dollar planes
53:18 -  for prestige though because their neighbor has one they have to have one it's a system predicated upon death and the only thing that will ever alleviate and alter it is the coming of the king he will mediate between nations there'll be no need to study war he will arbitrate in righteousness
53:34 -  and injustice this is not poetry you dear saints if we continue to hold this as poetry as as the commentator warned us in psalms we lose not only the meaning of psalm two but the whole faith is integral to it we need to have restored to us the theocratic intention of God through the
53:56 -  restoration of Israel through the mercy expressed to this church in the latter days it shall come to pass it'll not come to pass if we don't believe it don't expect it and are unwilling to sacrifice for it so let's look now at the psalm itself i've got an italics under the designation psalm two
54:20 -  this statement the messiah's triumphant kingdom what do you have in italics do you look at that when you read the psalms always and every edition is a little different we rarely think of messiah as king we rarely think of messiah politically we rarely think of messiah as the Israel rule
54:41 -  but that's what a messiah is an anointed king and so it begins why do the nations rage i'll tell you why because they don't want him to succeed in his theocratic intention they want to remain autonomous independent arrogant and self-sufficient doing their own thing as if their
55:05 -  turf is theirs hey this is our current we own this this land we we've got it through victory through warfare that that that the earth is the lord's it's not your playground it's not your place of exploitation it belongs to him and you are unwilling to acknowledge that in your arrogance
55:25 -  you think it's yours you've got to be reminded the earth is the lord's why do the nations rage and what is rage it's an uttermost emotion it's not why are the nations irritated or even why are the nations vexed why do the nations rage rage is ultimate anger hatred
55:50 -  foaming over at the mouth this word is not arbitrarily inserted this is by the holy spirit putting the divine finger on the condition of the nations against God in the inveterate hatred of him and their independence from him that anything that will threaten them and bring
56:13 -  them into an alliance of having to come into his tent hatred anger of the kind that i glimpsed in canada we'll we'll come back to this at a later time and say well art it's all your fault because had you listened to what the man said you wouldn't have then taken the microphone back and said
56:34 -  my invitation still stands you probably would have removed the invitation because that's what bugged him so much that he had to strike you with his bible and call you a jewish pride jewish flesh well possibly or is it that something even beyond the man's own cognizance something in his deeds
56:57 -  as a gentile and a man of the nations particularly anglo-saxon british commonwealth nations was pricked of the kind that is expressed in the very first statement of song two the rage i don't have a word saying this is prophetic intuition there's the deepest inveterate anger
57:19 -  against God rages when you're frightened and terrified that's something that is of the profoundest vested interest for you your self-interest is being seriously threatened you don't react respect to that react to that lightly you react to that with the fiercest
57:37 -  anger even to the point of rage rage is almost uncontrollable what would you call the motivation to destroy the two trade towers in the pentagon it was calibrated it was coldly and cruelly deliberated but the animus to bring that destruction even at the loss of the lives
57:57 -  who affected it is rage what are we seeing with the suicide bombers rage what do we see when the missiles came over in the iraqi war and fell on tel aviv and palestinians were dancing on the rooftops what happened when the the bomb exploded at the hebrew university and five of the seven
58:16 -  killed were americans and that the devastation came in a place where it's least expected there was celebration palestinians were giving out candy we can't plumb the depths of this this rage because the root of this rage is satanic as God is love satan is hatred and hatred against
58:38 -  the people of God hatred against God himself hatred against the purposes of God let alone those purposes that will once and for all and finally end the false usurping reign of these powers that prevail right now even as we speak the only thing that will end it is the lord ruling
58:55 -  from zion why do the nations rage and the people plot a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord against his anointed saying let us break their bonds and pieces and cast away shred them shred their courts from us
59:18 -  but he who sits in the heaven shall laugh the lord shall hold them in derision then he shall speak to them in his wrath and distress them in his deepest pleasure yet i have set my king on my holy hill on zion thank you i've got that in yellow underlined asterisk verse six
59:41 -  speaking as if it's already accomplished yet i have set my king on my holy hill of zion so this is future and yet spoken of as if it's already taking place which is a typical prophetic thing that is beyond time but before we dwell on that you mustn't miss
01:00:02 -  verse two the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together is this an unnecessary repetition what is called a redundancy the kings of the earth and the rulers is that like saying the kings and the kings or is the psalmist indicating two levels of rule
01:00:21 -  one is the kings of the earth the visible magistrates and the other is a realm of rulership that is invisible but potent in fact actually influences the visible kings the monarchs and the rulers and they take counsel together showing that what what is the nexus of opposition
01:00:43 -  to the rule of God the powers of the air in concert with those that are operating in the earth you can't understand hitler without that hitler had an experience listening to a Wagnerian opera that affected all of his subsequent life and gave the motivation for his dictatorship and
01:01:04 -  his vengeance and vehemence against the jew and precipitating a great world war almost the end of civilization well hitler was influenced by Wagner something came into him listening to that pagan triumphant music that draws upon pagan heroes and heroines it's another
01:01:28 -  celebration that is anti-hebraic and anti-biblical that celebrates pagan deities and classic conflicts of these mythological figures that came into hitler's whole spirit and consciousness and influences whole subsequent conduct so we cannot understand
01:01:49 -  nazism we can't understand evil we can't understand mass destruction we can't understand our own generation if we exempt the influence of these powers who rage and rule and influence governments and societies now amen this is the context of our faith as i said there's only one
01:02:10 -  agency given by God by which they can be recognized and combated it's the church but a church of what kind a church that is not under any of their influence who do not in any way allow their influences influences to permeate their own conduct because they rule by fear by intimidation
01:02:30 -  by threat by ambition by appeals to lust appeals to power appeals to all the kinds of things for which men are motivated in the world where is there a church that has understood this and consciously has refused and rejected it and is not marching by that beat but by another
01:02:51 -  that celebrates humility trust faith love peace quiet and is not in fear and insecurity for its life no matter what happens in the world that church can oppose the powers of the earth its very presence is an opposition its very presence is a freeing influence in the community where it has
01:03:14 -  its life so we'll not come to that condition unless we come to it together and know that there's a battle there are two wisdoms contending for dominance and that's why Paul says in ephesians three that God has created all things about an order through the church the manifold wisdom of God
01:03:34 -  might be demonstrated to the principalities and powers of the earth will not be conscious of that unless we understand some food unless you understand the whole context in which we are called as the church we're saved for this we often tease congregations when i'm on the subject
01:03:52 -  by reminding them what these powers say Jesus we know and Paul you know but who are you we're not obliged to know you until you exhibit to us who recognize what is authentic what we saw in Jesus and what we saw in Paul until you exhibit that we scorn you what you're going to take cities for
01:04:11 -  christ by worship and by shouting ha ha ha until we see the character of God in you the hope of the total submittedness to the purposes of God where your life is not held as dear to yourself you live as sacrificially as Jesus and Paul we're not obliged to consider you so this is the moral
01:04:34 -  struggle that is taking place okay so they take counsel against the lord and against his anointed let us break their bonds and pieces cast away the courts from us but God and thrown into heaven's laughs and holds them in derision
01:04:57 -  he shall speak to them in his wrath but stressed them in his deep displeasure this pleasure because God's answer is i have set my king on my holy hill of zion and of course that's the whole tent of shen zion is that place that's where the nation shall come
01:05:20 -  as we read in isaiah chapter 2 to learn of the ways of the lord and be domesticated which we be tempered though we are enlarged our very coming and submitting and bowing to come annually into that place will have a redemptive effect upon our character and life otherwise we will continue
01:05:40 -  to be the high arrogant violently disposed nationalistically minded nations that have brought a road to the world since time immemorial this is our the provision by which not only will be tempered but become changed and become ourself shemlike that all nations shall
01:06:08 -  become hebraicized including Israel itself and then shall peace prevail and righteousness in the earth because he set his king on his holy hill it says in acts 321 Jesus is retained in the heavens waiting for the restoration of all things
01:06:33 -  spoken by the prophets since the world began he cannot come and occupy the throne of david though he is a descendant of the son of david and has every legal right and qualification to be king until all that has been spoken by the prophets of the of restoration shall be fulfilled
01:06:55 -  and that is the restoration of Israel herself i will declare the decree the lord has said to me you are my son today i have begotten you ask of me i will give you the nations for your inheritance
01:07:11 -  and the ends of the earth for your possession you shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel and then the warning be wise oh kings and be instructed you judges of their serve the lord with fear rejoice with troubling kiss the son lest he be angry blessed are all those who put their
01:07:28 -  trust in him so the the privilege of the king and his right is the nations for his inheritance and the ends of the earth the same phrase used in psalm 96 for his possession the issue of zion is the issue of the nations to the ends of the earth that the rule of God shall go forth from
01:07:53 -  the holy hill of zion is that hill holy now anyone who goes to Israel has got to be pained at the political cultural condition that now prevails and that's why isaiah 4 talks about drusillan being submitted to a spirit of burning and a spirit of purging it is not fit for the king
01:08:20 -  i go reluctantly on the occasions when i'm required by the lord to go i would never go of myself
