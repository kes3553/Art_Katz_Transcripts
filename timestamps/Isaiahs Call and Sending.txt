Isaiahs Call and Sending

00:00 -  I want to brood jealously over this initial text in Isaiah chapter 6, the commissioning of the great prophet Isaiah, who just dwell over the remarkable content, brood,
00:20 -  and allow the Lord to bring forth right on the spot, creatively, spontaneously, by His Spirit, insight, interpolation, and give us a fullness of what it means to be sent.
00:37 -  For we are all aware that the root of the Greek word, apostolous, means sent one. That the issue of what is apostolic is the issue of what is sent.
00:52 -  And indeed, my God, do I dare presume and say that I myself am a sent one here, sent from a little band of souls in northern Minnesota,
01:05 -  and that the very genius and mystery of the root is not only to be explicated, but to be demonstrated. So let it be, Lord, in whatever measure that that's true,
01:18 -  may we now have the blessing and the fullness of what it means when men come who do not initiate their own coming, who do not presume to move at their own will,
01:33 -  but wait upon being sent out of a body that itself comprises, contains, and reflects the genius of what it means to be sent, even as they remain.
01:49 -  So Lord, amplify this hot root of the word apostolic, for if we lose that, we have lost everything. And I thank you for the privilege, Lord,
02:03 -  of your having recently opened this text to me as a remarkable, hermeneutic, fancy Greek word. That means a key of interpretation,
02:17 -  that this text, Isaiah 6, who shall go for us, whom shall we send, is a key of understanding. And so Lord, you jealously rood over that text now.
02:34 -  It may not be that there'll be another text in the days that remain of this week, but every day you'll come back to it and open it,
02:42 -  how so ever it pleases you, Lord, come and draw out and give us the understanding of your own great apostolic and priestly heart,
02:52 -  for which we thank you and give you the praise for the privilege of hearing and being changed by a sent word through a sent one.
03:01 -  In Jesus' name, God's people said, Amen. Well, let's look at the text. In the year that King Uzziah died.
03:14 -  What a remarkable way to commence. Is God just giving us a timeline? Is that just a chronological piece of data
03:26 -  that we can date the approximate time in which the vision and the call comes to Isaiah? Or is there greater import in the commencement of that text
03:39 -  in the year that King Uzziah died? That the great revelation, the great call, begins with a death, not just as a marker,
03:51 -  but somehow as an issue of a primal kind. Out of life and significance is to commence, it begins with death.
04:02 -  So the great theme of death, resurrection, is inserted even in this Old Testament text because it's intrinsic to the way
04:12 -  and the knowledge of God eternally. It was not a principle that was adopted by the advent of Jesus.
04:20 -  Jesus explicated and performed what was always intrinsic in the heart of God, the mystery and the conjunction between a death
04:29 -  that necessarily precedes a life, a suffering that precedes a glory. So we should not be astonished
04:36 -  that this great text begins in the year that King Uzziah died. I'll come back to that.
04:45 -  I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty, for I saw him lifted up, and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
04:57 -  Seraphs were in attendance above him. Each had six wings. With two they covered their faces,
05:02 -  with two they covered their feet, with two they flew. And one called to another and said,
05:08 -  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of His glory. The pivots on the threshold shook
05:17 -  for the voice of those who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, woe is me!
05:27 -  I am lost, I am undone, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among the people of unclean lips,
05:35 -  and yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then one of the seraphs flew to me
05:45 -  holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth with it
05:52 -  and said, now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed, your sin is blotted out. Then, notice the thens, then, then.
06:04 -  There's a sequence here. It's not just we're reading on historical account, but a divine logic of necessity
06:12 -  that is implied in any issue of sending. This is going to make a demand upon you, as it did last night,
06:22 -  that our speaking is so conceptually full, and we're not accustomed to such weight of content in so few words.
06:32 -  So listen, I'm saying that the then, the then, the then is not just a sequence, but a significant pattern,
06:43 -  not just for Isaiah, but for us or any who are called in any time and in any place,
06:50 -  and especially in the last days. Got that? So focus on the thens.
06:56 -  I saw the Lord then. I cried out, I'm undone, then. The seraph takes a call from the altar, then.
07:06 -  See, then, then, then. There's a sequence of a divine logic and a requirement intrinsic to any true sending.
07:18 -  In some measure, whoever is sent needs to pass through the sequence of thens to which Isaiah himself was submitted.
07:27 -  See how classic a text this is? You see how I'm reading it? You see, observe.
07:33 -  I'm giving you a prophetic commentary. This is the way I perceive this text, because something leaps off the page for me.
07:42 -  The then, the then, the then that needs to be brought to your attention. If you are to see and behold prophetically,
07:50 -  if you are to properly draw out from a text the remarkable weight and genius that is given in the great wisdom of God
07:59 -  in this very brief description. Have you noticed how terse, T-E-R-S-E, the scriptures are?
08:08 -  How compact, that the greatest events are described in so few words, and they crucified him.
08:17 -  There's something that waits upon us to draw out, to exegete the Greek word, to draw out the meaning, to dwell upon,
08:27 -  to luxuriate, to take that word and turn it over in our hearts and our mouths. And you'll know that you're on the right track
08:38 -  when you begin to salivate. Got that? When the juices run in your mouth,
08:44 -  you're on the right track. But if you're dry-mouthed, you're still Chinese, all too Chinese.
08:51 -  Too clinical, too mechanical, too analytical. So listen, we're going to take it easy. We're going to luxuriate in these days.
09:02 -  I'm going to make any comment that comes to mind and heart, even as I'm doing now,
09:08 -  that you will have the full value in a life-changing and ministerial-affecting way that can be called properly
09:17 -  prophetic and apostolic, which is the desperate need of the hour. If you're not reading prophetically,
09:26 -  how shall you speak prophetically? Reading is not just a visual matter. There's reading and reading.
09:36 -  So how to dwell on the text. The great mistake of the immature speakers and ministers is too much text and too little commentary.
09:51 -  You can always tell, and I'm bored stiff, when a speaker goes from text to text to text to fill the hour
10:00 -  and has not taken any one aspect of it and sufficiently explicated it. I had to reprimand one of the leading pastors
10:11 -  of the greatest megachurches in West Africa for just such a practice. I said, Lord, how do I, little Jewish upshot,
10:22 -  correct this African man whose congregation is five or six thousand? But as I sat there listening to him,
10:31 -  he just employed text after text with hardly a commentary just to fill the hour. So they gave me a tour of the church afterwards
10:41 -  and we ended in his office. And taking a deep breath, I suggested a correction. I said fewer texts and more ample commentary
10:53 -  will feed the flock of God. So be aware if you're invoking two, three, four, five texts for one message, you've already, you're on wrong ground.
11:06 -  Stay with a text and amplify it. Rude over it. Draw it out. Then, then, then I heard a voice,
11:22 -  the voice of the Lord saying, whom shall I send and who will go for us? And I said, here am I, send me.
11:31 -  And he said, go and say to this people, well, I've been waiting for this moment just to dwell on who shall go for us
11:41 -  and who shall we send. I've been waiting for this not because I have the answer, but because I want to hear it coming out of my own mouth
11:52 -  and from my own edification as well as yours. That the great question, who, implies there are not many. Who will go for us?
12:03 -  Let's dwell on that, saints. Who's the us? Some plurality in the Godhead,
12:11 -  a conversation between father and son, raising an ultimate question, because who shall go for us
12:22 -  is not the commissioning of an errand boy. It's representing the one who sends. This is ultimate.
12:32 -  Who? Can we find a candidate that in sending this candidate,
12:37 -  we send ourselves? He expresses not only the burden that we're giving him to bear,
12:44 -  but what we are in ourselves and the character of God. He's a sent one.
12:51 -  He's not just the bearer of the word. He's the thing in himself. He represents the most high.
12:59 -  Help me with this. I'm not willing to pass this by quickly. This question is searching.
13:06 -  It's haunting. Who shall go for us? Because if we can't find one,
13:13 -  then the object, the intention, the design of God languishes or fails. It requires someone of a prepared kind,
13:27 -  not just in ministerial skill, but character, something that reflects the God
13:35 -  who has commissioned him. Because in his going, we are going. If we don't weigh this up sufficiently,
13:44 -  the rest of the text collapses. We have to start with the end in order to go back to the beginning
13:51 -  in the year that King Uzziah died. Who? We need to be haunted by that question.
13:57 -  Who? It implies there are not many. There are a lot of ambitious people
14:05 -  with ministerial interests who like to go and have exciting times and be objects of celebrity,
14:16 -  but they're disqualified. Even by that eagerness, they're too eager.
14:24 -  I've always been checked in my spirit by men who are introduced to speak and rush up to the platform
14:32 -  full of vim and vinegar and ready to go. I wonder about that because that's not my experience.
14:38 -  I come like a snail. I wish that the floor would open and swallow me.
14:44 -  What am I doing here? I'm over my head. Fear, trepidation, anxiety.
14:50 -  I can't understand this this russ manner of men as if it's an issue of professionalism.
14:59 -  There's too much ambition. The moment God sees it, they're disqualified.
15:06 -  There's got to be a profound sense of terrible unworthiness. I don't know how if I'm expressing
15:12 -  or registering that because I always look better than I feel. No one ever believes I'm sick
15:20 -  and I always give the impression of a man who has it together even while I'm choking and spluttering
15:27 -  and waiting for the next word. So don't be deceived by appearances. There's got to be an inward sense
15:34 -  of trembling because to go for God, my God,
15:40 -  do you realize what he's saying? To go for God, to go for us, the genius of the
15:46 -  composite triune God in His name, His honor, His purpose, the things that are appointed
15:54 -  eternally, that were always with Him, works to be performed
16:00 -  before the foundations of the earth are laid? Who is able, who is worthy
16:06 -  to go for them and represent them not only in what we say
16:12 -  but in what we are? When one wrong word, one wrong illustration, one wrong accent,
16:18 -  the whole thing can collapse and contradict the character and the nature
16:24 -  of the God whom we represent. So when God says who shall go for us,
16:30 -  He's raising an ultimate question because going and being sent
16:36 -  is an ultimate phenomenon. And the church of the last days
16:42 -  must be ultimate or it's not the church at all. And to whom
16:48 -  is the prophet going? But to the nation Israel.
16:54 -  And his speaking is going to pronounce judgment. But notice
17:00 -  that the candidate does not say, go where?
17:06 -  To do what? I want to assess what descending will mean
17:12 -  that I might approve it before I say, here am I. We've got
17:18 -  to note that Isaiah does not ask where,
17:24 -  when, what. What will be the consequence of my going? Will I come back?
17:30 -  Will I be received? Will I be welcomed? Will I be understood?
17:36 -  There's not a single question raised verbally or in the heart of the man to be sent as to what is
17:42 -  the consequence for him in going. For if he but even harbored such a question, he would be disqualified.
17:48 -  It doesn't matter where and to whom.
17:54 -  And what is the consequence for me? Because having seen the Lord high and lifted up
18:00 -  and having been undone, me is totally out of the question. Are you beginning to
18:06 -  appreciate what it means to be a sent one? And everything that I'm saying about a sent one
18:12 -  is equally as valid for those who remain.
18:18 -  It's equally as valid for the Antioch that sends Saul and Barnabas
18:24 -  at the request of God, separate unto me, as the men who are actually sent.
18:30 -  This is a very important point, saints. The sending body is one with
18:36 -  those who are sent. Antioch is a phenomenon
18:42 -  for which God has waited. It did not take place in the Church of Jerusalem
18:48 -  because it was monolithic. It was all exclusively Jewish. What God
18:54 -  wanted was a statement for the nations comprised by the nations representing
19:00 -  and reflecting race and ethnic origin and every kind
19:06 -  of thing that makes for violence in the world and hatred, enmity, fear, suspicion,
19:12 -  jealousy was to be found in the congregation of Antioch in Acts 13.
19:18 -  Black men and white men and Jews and Gentiles and Mediterranean, the whole motley representation
19:24 -  of that world was in that congregation. But when they were found worshipping the Lord
19:30 -  together, another great word the Holy Ghost said,
19:36 -  separate unto me Saul or Paul and Barnabas for the work went to, I've called them.
19:42 -  Because what you have now in this worship that is far more than just charismatic
19:48 -  songs, this ability to be transcendent despite your
19:54 -  history of national and ethnic differences that in the world are the issue of threat, violence
20:00 -  and death. What you are and what you have attained in this congregation and all
20:06 -  its diversity needs now to be sent into that world. So the issue of the sending
20:12 -  of Paul and Barnabas is the issue of ascending body. So what I'm saying to you that is so critical
20:18 -  if we are to move from beyond charismatica into apostolic
20:24 -  corporaity, corporateness in the word together which is more than just alongside
20:30 -  each other in the pews is that the body that sends is of the same quality
20:36 -  tensile strength and character as those themselves
20:42 -  who are sent. The issue of sending is not the issue of
20:48 -  movement it's the issue of condition
20:54 -  so that the ones who remain and send by laying on of hands so they lay their hands upon
21:00 -  them fast that they were sent by the Holy Ghost went is the issue that
21:06 -  those that go and those that remain are cut out of the same cloth.
21:12 -  The issue of being sent does not require necessary movement nor mobility
21:18 -  it's the issue of having attained a character
21:24 -  that's transcendent and contrary to the natural ethos
21:30 -  and culture of violence and hatred and jealousy and fear of which you came
21:36 -  originally you've come now to a heavenly place so that those who are
21:42 -  sent from you are of the same texture and kind as those who remain.
21:48 -  Not the idea if you miss this you miss the genius of what is
21:54 -  apostolic where there's no way to understand the great climactic power
22:00 -  of what Paul performed in going except that we see it
22:06 -  as not an expression of individual virtuosity but a reflection of the
22:12 -  corporate quality of the life which has sent him has laid hands on him
22:18 -  continues to intercede for him and affects the what takes place in the point
22:24 -  of ministry and the places to which he will be brought. That
22:30 -  deserves to be repeated. Sending body is the issue of
22:36 -  what is apostolic. It's not some virtuosity although who will in any way
22:43 -  diminish Paul. But what I'm saying is you cannot understand Paul
22:49 -  or the effect of Paul for those that were sent turned the world upside down
22:55 -  not as the expression only of what they are in God individually but the expression
23:01 -  also of what they are from the body from which they were sent.
23:07 -  The issue of sending is as acute for those who remain as those
23:13 -  who go. So who shall go for us is a very great
23:19 -  question. And I'll tell you this dear saints unless we're conscious and
23:25 -  desirous of being a sending body there would be no sending.
23:31 -  How dare we leave for such a prospect except we be
23:37 -  sent by the laying on of hands of those with whom we are
23:43 -  tempered together in an agreement that is more than just verbal
23:49 -  or superficial or religious but has come out of a suffering by which those that are
23:55 -  black and white and from this background and Jew and Gentile have come to
24:01 -  be together through a process of what makes
24:07 -  the church the church. The word for that is suffering. It's not a, as my wife says with a Danish
24:15 -  accent, it's not a picnic. It's a suffering. It has been for her
24:23 -  to be joined together in such a motley combination of souls
24:29 -  of Jesus freaks and people who have had no discipline in their lives and borrow her pots and pans
24:35 -  and don't bring them back or bring them back dented tracking their mud into her kitchen.
24:41 -  Apostolic fellowship is a pain and a suffering before
24:49 -  it's a glory. But if we're unwilling for it and want only to be content with the charismatic
24:55 -  alternative which is happy and pleasant but is not a basis
25:01 -  for sending there will be no sending. And God will continue to ask the haunting
25:07 -  question, who shall go for us? So I'm so sympathetic with
25:13 -  Paul when he says, leave me alone. I've got the wounds in my body for Christ's sake.
25:19 -  And I was just sharing with one of the brothers here at the airport. I said,
25:25 -  I don't have physical wounds but I have inward wounds of what it means
25:31 -  to live and be part of the church, to come to this composite
25:37 -  corporality, this truth of apostolic reality in a body. And all of the diversity
25:43 -  and difference and stupefying numbing, mind numbing differences
25:49 -  that are expressed over every point in particular which you'd want to sweep away
25:55 -  by one authoritative word and say, I'm head here this is the way it's going to be
26:01 -  but you have to condescend and patiently forbear and listen to
26:07 -  the complaints and the perspectives that each one has
26:13 -  and has scripture to prove it so when they were found they were ministering on the Lord together
26:19 -  don't think that that was a piece of magic that God is discreet
26:25 -  and does not show us what it required in Antioch to attain
26:31 -  to that union but you can believe that is summed up in the word
26:37 -  suffering misunderstanding alienation, fear
26:43 -  jealousy all of the historic elements that have affected
26:49 -  the nations were in that congregation so it wasn't by the Lord waving
26:55 -  a magical wand over them that they had come to the place of ministering unto the Lord
27:01 -  together it was through a process of sacrifice
27:07 -  of patience of forbearance of confrontation
27:13 -  of speaking the truth in love of confession of forgiveness
27:19 -  suffering precedes the glory and churches are suffering before it's a glory
27:25 -  it's not that we're malicious or that we intend to be harmful
27:31 -  we're well meaning saints but we're saints in the condition that we're in
27:37 -  when you come together in the intensity of life together
27:43 -  as community those differences and individual variances
27:49 -  that make for conflict and misunderstanding necessarily rise
27:55 -  they rose in Antioch and they've got to rise in Malaysia
28:01 -  or wherever it is that you're from or there is no sending
28:07 -  unless you are together forever so who shall go for us
28:13 -  with such a great haunting and continuing question to this
28:19 -  very hour whom shall we send
28:25 -  who will express us who will be in character with the Godhead
28:31 -  who will show forth the essential nature of the humility and
28:37 -  uniqueness of the lamb in a way that is unaffected and unselfconscious
28:43 -  because the sent one is the thing in himself he's not a performer
28:49 -  who will go for us who doesn't ask what is it going to cost me will I be understood
28:55 -  will I be received will I come back alive because now I'm learning
29:01 -  go and speak means bring judgment on the nation which judgment
29:07 -  prevails to this very moment your ears are stopped, your hearts are heavy they cannot understand, they cannot believe
29:13 -  what Isaiah has spoken being sent brought a condition upon the nation
29:19 -  that prevails to this very hour how would you like to be the agent of that
29:25 -  speaking obedience is suffering
29:31 -  but if you so much as ask the question from your own heart what will this cost me
29:37 -  because I'm so sensitive if somebody looks at me cross eyed
29:43 -  or they don't appreciate me or if I'm snubbed takes me days and weeks to recover
29:49 -  well don't think that you're going to be sent if you're that thin skinned
29:55 -  and subject to being so easily offended because to go to Jews
30:01 -  with a message like this is a death sentence and I believe that that man died
30:09 -  when he saw the Lord high and lifted up he didn't see him in some effulgent glory I used to think
30:15 -  that was the Lord high and lifted up his train filled the temple with some brocaded velvet garment with
30:21 -  tapestry of stitches he saw the Lord on the cross
30:27 -  he saw him entailed centuries in advance of the event he saw the great
30:33 -  epical event because the lamb was slain from before the foundations of the earth were laid
30:39 -  and that sight of God in ultimate sacrifice
30:45 -  was a revelation not only of what God himself is demonstrated
30:51 -  in that supreme event but what man is that required that
30:57 -  event put that in your spiritual pipe and smoke it because Karl Barth
31:03 -  most neglected 20th century genius theological
31:09 -  giant said there's no way to understand the magnitude of sin
31:15 -  until we glimpse what was required to expiate it
31:21 -  what Isaiah saw is what many of us however correct we are in our doctrine
31:27 -  have not yet adequately seen and until we see it there's no sending and there's no
31:33 -  going because the cry was having seen the Lord high
31:39 -  and lifted up implies by the assertion of men
31:45 -  impaled on a cross and raised and that thing put in its socket as a pivot
31:51 -  in the earth the event registered he had a vision
31:57 -  a needful vision we can pray for the same and he cried out
32:03 -  woe is me I am undone for I am
32:09 -  a man of unclean lips and I live in the midst of the people of unclean lips but I'll tell you
32:15 -  what the text would have been just as devastating if it had ended for I am a man
32:21 -  but to be a man is necessarily to have unclean lips
32:27 -  there's a depravity there's an Adamic paint
32:33 -  that's deep in the very nature of what we are however well meaning
32:39 -  that until we see it and cry out about it there's no sending
32:45 -  for what value to God in sending a half-baked religionist
32:51 -  who has only a body of correct doctrine and has not himself been exercised
32:57 -  and stretched out to breaking by the reality that the doctrines represent for he has seen
33:03 -  the Lord the King high and lifted up
33:09 -  and he knows that that death and that suffering has to do with my condition
33:15 -  the fact that I'm a prophet does not exempt me from sharing
33:21 -  in the condition to which all men are guilty I'm depraved
33:27 -  yes I've spoken already in the Lord's name and have done admirably but I'm a man of
33:33 -  unclean lips because I have pacified I have complimented
33:39 -  I have been ingratiating I've said things that ought not to have been said
33:45 -  in order to appease men or to win their favor or to avoid
33:51 -  embarrassment or I was silent when I should have spoken you cannot be a man
33:57 -  and not have unclean lips I'm a man
34:03 -  I never saw that before it took the revelation of God
34:09 -  in his exquisite and ultimate anguish of suffering being lifted up
34:15 -  to make me to understand why that act was required
34:21 -  for my sin I'm a man and until you have
34:27 -  come to that you're not qualified to be sent what will you bring?
34:33 -  some shallow little assemblage of correctness
34:39 -  hey listen saints the world is dying here's a
34:45 -  I'm staggered I don't know how to go on my spirit knows that there's more that needs to be considered
34:51 -  and I'm not able to voice it we need to intuit
34:57 -  this we need to be apprehended by what is intrinsic
35:03 -  to ascending for God is not going to send paper mache saints and cardboard
35:09 -  cutouts of charismatic correctness he's going to send men who have been
35:15 -  devastated by their realization of the truth of what they are in themselves
35:21 -  as man and what has required of God in the ultimate
35:27 -  sacrifice of his son and himself in unbelievable immeasurable anguish
35:33 -  of body and soul to expiate until I see that
35:39 -  and until I know that what is my message? what am I communicating?
35:45 -  what's the purpose of my being sent if I'm only going to confirm the world
35:51 -  in its own shallowness in its own life in its own sentimentalities
35:57 -  which will embrace religion I've got to be the antithesis of all that is false
36:03 -  and the reality that reveals it is the Lord high and lifted up
36:09 -  and God did not say now don't get carried away brother you're the prince of the prophets
36:15 -  to you is afforded more revelation of myself as
36:21 -  messiah and the destiny of Israel's redemption than any other prophet
36:27 -  so don't knock yourself don't be negative have a higher sense of self esteem
36:33 -  but in fact it says the seraph brought a coal from the altar
36:39 -  sent from the most high to touch the lips of the prophet
36:45 -  that his sin would be forgiven God agreed
36:51 -  with the assessment of the prophet that I am undone
36:57 -  for I am a man see why this text is a key
37:03 -  a hermeneutical key we may dwell on this for the rest of our days together
37:09 -  and yet not exhausted until it comes into our spirit until we begin to glimpse and
37:15 -  see what is required before there's any sending of the truth of our condition
37:21 -  as man and the revelation of the glory of God
37:27 -  in righteousness and judgment and in mercy as was set forth profoundly
37:33 -  in the one and ultimate historic moment in the crucifixion of the Lord
37:39 -  Yeshua HaMashiach Jesus the Christ not to understand that
37:45 -  not to cry out over that is to be disqualified for any sending
37:51 -  religious bodies may send you committees may send you
37:57 -  yourself but what in fact will you bring until you have come to the
38:03 -  vision and the realization of woe is me interesting little assertion
38:09 -  in verse 3 about the seraphim the angelic
38:15 -  company continually crying out holy holy holy is the word of host
38:21 -  the whole earth is full of his glory what has that got to do with anything
38:27 -  it has got to do with everything this is
38:33 -  angelic seeing the whole earth is full of his glory
38:39 -  they're not just seeing the present moment they're seeing the entire eternity
38:45 -  of God as an angelic vista that embraces the whole great redemptive
38:51 -  glory of God and even in an hour and historic
38:57 -  time like ours where the world is shot through with violence and filth and
39:03 -  immorality and every ugly thing the angels still see beyond and through that to the
39:09 -  ultimate consummation of God and can cry the whole earth is full of his glory
39:15 -  and unless the man who is sent sees angelically he's not qualified to be sent
39:21 -  unless he sees the whole perspective sees the whole
39:27 -  ultimacy of God is not dissuaded by the horror of the present moment
39:33 -  or the historic future which is yet going to be worse but sees the ultimate consummation of God
39:39 -  holy holy holy that includes even the death of King
39:45 -  Josiah because if the prophet is mourning the loss of the king
39:51 -  the earthly king with whom evidently he had a profound relationship
39:57 -  he's not yet in the place for sending he's got to be in agreement with angels
40:03 -  that even if God takes your Josiah you still say holy holy
40:09 -  holy well I think we need to cut this off and just pray now
40:15 -  maybe come back to this again let this much linger in our spirits
40:21 -  and prick us show us our shallowness
40:29 -  show us our religious ambition to go and to do and
40:35 -  to perform and to be seen doing and to be applauded in being seen
40:41 -  weighing up what will be the benefit what will it cost me
40:47 -  being disqualified by every such consideration that is not yet apostolic
40:53 -  so Lord thank you for introducing this
40:59 -  great text and I pray for us Lord that we will dwell upon it
41:05 -  if Isaiah the prince of prophets needed such a
41:11 -  revelation both of yourself and the truth of his own condition what do we need
41:17 -  and when have we ever come to it merely to give doctrinal agreement
41:23 -  to the issue of atonement blood the cross
41:29 -  but not to be penetrated with the deep oeuvre the cry of woe is me
41:35 -  is not yet to be apprehended by it nor to be able to communicate it you don't need
41:41 -  to send half baked and shallow religionists who are only correct into a dying world
41:47 -  you need to send those who have glimpsed you in the truth and magnitude
41:53 -  of your ultimate sacrifice and in seeing that seeing themselves
41:59 -  I'm a man so Lord I pray for this precious congregation
42:05 -  what a potential to impact Asia and beyond that
42:11 -  maybe to have something to do with the Jews not only in Israel
42:17 -  but in New York which is the effectual Jerusalem of modern day Judaism
42:23 -  because they are sent so I bless this people Lord
42:29 -  and we invite you in the night hours to trouble our spirits to show us
42:35 -  the truth of our yet inadequate condition we're even afraid
42:41 -  to say here am I send me we're too caught up with what will be the consequence of being sent
42:47 -  we want assurances and guarantees so Lord something is at stake tonight
42:53 -  and in these days for this Asia, this Malaysia
42:59 -  the great mainland China the most formidable nation of the
43:05 -  present modern world the issue of the Jew as it will be sifted through the nations
43:11 -  and needs to be met by you and those who will reveal you
43:17 -  as you in fact are and not as men suppose you to be
43:23 -  so I bless this people Lord thank you for this commencement the sounding of the theme
43:29 -  let it reverberate in our hearts and our thoughts let us come back to our places
43:35 -  and open the text and dwell upon every word so you open it
43:41 -  and we pray my God so much as it pleases you to grant us a measure of
43:47 -  division granted to Isaiah however painful a scene that is
43:53 -  it's a needful seeing and we have not yet obtained it
43:59 -  we may not even have welcomed it because we have no stomach for pain
44:05 -  we want the convenience of being correct in doctrine without the appropriation
44:11 -  of the reality that has got to be registered in our deeps with an anguished cry woe is
44:17 -  me Lord you've not heard that from our lips yet and I'm praying that you will
44:23 -  thank you for tonight put a seal on it let you word my God the hammer upon
44:29 -  the rock who split and break up every heart and resistant thing that
44:35 -  is self satisfied self congratulatory self approving
44:41 -  that things we have already arrived and we are already candidates to be apostolic and prophetic
44:47 -  thank you my God for your jealous love that will not let us
44:53 -  go thank you for your patience and waiting thank you for the appointed time that has come
44:59 -  thank you for the text that has been revealed perform it my God we pray
45:05 -  receive our gratitude for the so great privilege as we bow before
45:11 -  you in Jesus name Amen
