True Ministry

00:00 -  A few nights ago, God started speaking about truth, truth in word and truth in deed. And last night He spoke about true life, and I think tonight that He wants to speak about true ministry.
00:18 -  I can't think of a more desperately needed speaking, especially in such an age as ours, and there's such a prolific number of ministries everywhere. I'm especially sensitive to youthful ministries, and I don't think that it's an old man looking
00:42 -  down with a jaundiced eye upon kids who are having a wonderful time conducting services. I think it might be something of the solemnity of God, who when He established His priesthood, gave as the year upon which a priest began his ministry the age 30.
01:11 -  The first 30 years were wasted. Can you imagine being 19 and 20 and not having a ministry? 21 and 22, my, you must be chomping at the bit.
01:22 -  And 23 and 24, you must be just about ready to come apart at the scene. You're full of vim and vinegar and energy and dynamism, poisonality, as we say in Brooklyn. Tremendous advantages for the kingdom, and certainly there would be an impact if you
01:42 -  could be released. But God said in times past, that's a no-no. You waited until you were 30 to begin your ministry.
01:53 -  His son had to wait that long. In 1 Peter, you don't have to turn to it. This is not my text.
02:08 -  The second chapter and the fifth verse, we read, you also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
02:30 -  There's something very sacred about priesthood, which I think God wants to remind us tonight. First that it's holy. And I don't know if any of us will ever really approach that word and understand from it
02:42 -  what we ought. I'll tell your children that I'll save you a trip to the dictionary. It'll avail you nothing.
02:50 -  You'll not find the meaning of it in Webster's. And maybe you've noticed already that every great word is not to be obtained by recourse to dictionaries.
03:02 -  They're to be obtained far more expensively. And if I were God and had something to do about it, I would say that the knowledge of the word holy should be high on our list of priorities.
03:14 -  However much pain would be involved in the understanding of it. Whatever the cost, as God puts that word first before every other consideration, holy priesthood. Before I considered priesthood, I would first consider holy.
03:30 -  I think it's probably the absence of the knowledge of it that explains more than anything the flood of calo, C-A-L-L-O-W, easy glib facile ministries that we see right now in Christendom. Just about anybody who can strum a guitar somehow has found a place.
03:55 -  And if he's not too good, we can just turn up the amplifier. What do they say, paraphrasing the scriptures? A good amplifier covers a multitude of sins?
04:08 -  Well, I've got one friend in the audience. Oh, dear children, you know what the definition of truth was? Did I say it to you the first night?
04:20 -  Truth is everything as God sees it, everything as God sees it. I wonder how he sees us tonight. I wonder how he would view the service thus far.
04:32 -  I wonder how much he appreciated the song service. I wonder how much he appreciates most of our charismatic trappings. I would almost give anything if I could just see as God sees and perceives our present
04:52 -  condition. I wonder if we would be stunned by the contrast of the way he sees as against as we see. And maybe that's one of the reasons why he's given us the book.
05:06 -  And I'm going to be very tedious tonight and read laboriously and painstakingly from a section of scripture that not many of us ever have occasion to survey. It's monotonous, it's dreary, it's painstaking, it's full of explicit little details.
05:20 -  And I'll tell you frankly that I've not had much appetite myself to dote upon it. It's to be found in Leviticus, we'll turn there briefly in a moment. It's all got to do with priesthood and a whole array of painstaking details that God required
05:40 -  in that old covenant priesthood of which we were reminded today was only a type and a shadow, and that we have come to a more glorious covenant by which I would assume that if God were demanding then, He would be far more demanding now.
05:55 -  If that priesthood were only a shadow, that the substance of the fulfillment now would be even more painstaking, more profound in its requirements, not less. Even so, as we come to the end of the age, I think that ministry is a sacred thing in
06:15 -  God. It's not an antidote for boredom, it's not some wholesome alternative to finding entertainments in the world.
06:25 -  It's a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices. And I would just say for a rough rule of thumb that if ministry of any kind costs us nothing, likely, it does not have great significance or redeeming value.
06:48 -  True priesthood, as we'll see in a moment, always costs something. Sacrifice of such proportion that it will boggle our minds merely to survey it. And I would suspect if that was true then, it should be equally true now.
07:03 -  It's an act of service that is easy and glib and requires nothing. I wouldn't class it as a spiritual sacrifice. True prayer, true ministry, true witness always costs something, children.
07:23 -  As we say in Yiddish, it comes out of the kishkes, out of the gut. There's usually a reproach somewhere to be found lurking on the heels of it. You're usually going to suffer some criticism for the expressing of it.
07:36 -  You'll usually have to accept at least a minimum of misunderstanding for your faithfulness to God, invariably. It's not going to enhance your popularity as a rule.
07:47 -  You might be considered more lonesome when you're finished than when you began. And it may be that when the whole thing is over and the smoke clears, there's only one who's pleased with you.
07:57 -  It's the Lord Himself. It's a sacrifice. It's a spiritual sacrifice.
08:04 -  And for the life of me, I have yet to find any sacrifice that has not been painful, bloody, costly. It's acceptable to God, and I think we ought to be reminded of this, that every priestly
08:17 -  ministry is unto God and not unto men. How do you like them apples? And I'll tell you, there are inordinate temptations to pitch your direction down rather than up.
08:30 -  I can't think of anything more seductive and more powerful and more tantalizing, heavier in its pressure than to be young and to be a minister. Listen, I used to be young once.
08:44 -  Oh, I know. And I remember, faintly, that I was very much concerned for peer approval. I wanted the back slap and the bear hug.
08:57 -  I wanted to see the expression of esteem and acceptance in those whose judgment and evaluation I prized. I think it would be a rare youth who has risen above that.
09:09 -  It would be a rare youth whose ministry is unto God and not unto men or not unto his own generation. There's a holy priesthood required and called to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
09:30 -  to God by Christ Jesus, not by our intelligence, not by our wit, not by our winsome personalities, not by our groovy talents. None of those buys, only by one thing, by Christ Jesus.
09:46 -  When you find that you've come to the place when you can do it yourself, it's no longer holy priesthood. It's some groovy alternative that has not redeeming an eternal value.
09:57 -  Dig? So may we find our amplifiers more frequently breaking down, our electronic devices, and all of the paraphernalia of our particular age.
10:13 -  Find ourselves trembling. Find ourselves more frequently beyond our abilities and skills and expertise and knowledge and personality.
10:22 -  Find ourselves wholly lacking. Find our knees knocking. Find our bowels rumbling.
10:29 -  Find our faces flushing and wholly be cast upon God by Christ Jesus. I want you to turn with me to the book of Leviticus, named from the tribe of the priests, the eighth chapter.
10:57 -  If you have a weak stomach and you're the sensitive type that can't stand much blood, this is your opportunity to leave before we go on. This is going to be sickly, folks.
11:09 -  Verge your loins. And we'll be finished tonight. We'll be standing in pools of blood.
11:15 -  Hallelujah. He must be Jewish. Okay.
11:20 -  Isn't it precious the way the eighth chapter begins, and I'm reading from the Amplified Edition, and the Lord said to Moses, hallelujah. I love everything that begins with the Lord saying, and I'll tell you that before we even
11:37 -  an iota into this text, may God give us a holy fear for anything that does not come by his speaking. May every ministry, every priestly duty begin with, the Lord said, may we avoid, as if it
11:53 -  were a plague, any self-initiated activity, any ministry which has its origin in us. I don't give a wrap what the needs in the world are. They can be stacked up to the doors with dying and sickly humanity.
12:07 -  I shall ever and always wait for the word of the Lord. Go, speak, do. May we never bypass God and relate ourselves directly to what we think are the human needs
12:22 -  before us. The Lord said to Moses, and the Lord is saying now, if we have an ear to hear it and a desire to wait, can you wait, you young fellows, until the Lord says?
12:40 -  I can't think of anything more deftly than you should wait. Inactivity, my goodness, how scandalous. You mean do nothing?
12:48 -  That's it, buddy. Silent, unspoken, unseen, unheard. It's death.
12:55 -  Exactly. Until the Lord shall say, and when he does start speaking, you might be surprised at the things he'll say.
13:02 -  He's not going to say, now, take your guitar and your electronic equipment and get me to Afghanistan. There's a great public meeting that I have set for you, a rally, 75,000.
13:16 -  He's liable to say, take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments of their office and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread and assemble all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
13:35 -  Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting. Moses told the congregation, this is what the Lord has commanded to be done.
13:45 -  Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. He put on Aaron the long undertuner, girded him with a long sash, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod upon him and girded him with the skillfully woven cords attached to
13:56 -  the ephod, binding it to him. And Moses put upon Aaron the breastplate. He also put in the breastplate the urim and the tumum, upon which the high priest put
14:05 -  his hand when seeking the divine will concerning the nation. And he put the turban or mitre on his head. On it in front, Moses put the shining gold plate, the holy diadem, as the Lord commanded
14:15 -  him. And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and consecrated them.
14:22 -  And he sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the laver and its base to consecrate them. And he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate
14:33 -  him. And Moses brought Aaron's sons and put under tunics on them and girded them with stashes and wound turbans on them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
14:41 -  Then he brought the bull of the sin offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. Moses killed it and took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar round about with
14:51 -  his finger and poured the blood at the base of the altar and purified and consecrated the altar to make atonement for it. He took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys
15:02 -  with their fat and Moses burned them on the altar. But the bull, the sin offering and its hide, its flesh and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
15:13 -  He brought the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram and Moses killed it and dashed the blood upon the altar round about. He cut the ram into pieces and Moses burned the head, the pieces and the fat.
15:25 -  And he washed the entrails and the legs in water. Then Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet and satisfying fragrance, an offering made by fire to the
15:34 -  Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration and ordination. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram and Moses killed it.
15:45 -  And took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot. And he brought Aaron's sons and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of the right
15:54 -  ears and the thumbs of the right hands and the great toes of the right feet. And Moses dashed the blood upon the altar round about. And he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of
16:04 -  the liver, the two kidneys and their fat and the right frying out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord. He took one unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the fat
16:14 -  and on the right thigh. And he put all these in Aaron's hands and his sons' hands and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.
16:22 -  Then Moses took these things from their hands and burned them on the altar with a burnt offering as an ordination offering for a sweet and satisfying fragrance, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
16:31 -  And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord. For the ram of consecration and ordination, it was Moses' portion as the Lord commanded him.
16:39 -  And Moses took some of the anointing oil and the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments and upon his sons and their garments also. So Moses consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons' and his sons' garments.
16:52 -  And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecration and ordination as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
17:02 -  And what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. And you shall not go out of the door of the tent of meeting for seven days until the days of your consecration and ordination are ended, for it will take seven days to consecrate
17:14 -  and obey you, as has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do for your atonement. At the door of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days, doing what the Lord has charged you to do, that you die not, for so I am commanded.
17:28 -  So Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord commanded by Moses. Let's pray. Gracious God, we ask, Lord, the ministry of your Holy Spirit.
17:43 -  You know, mighty God, how remote the description of these things is from the whole of our modern life. It seems to us so archaic, so absolutely distant, so biblical, has no seeming relevance, Lord,
17:59 -  to our present life activity, and we ask, Lord, that you might show us, by your Spirit, just what is the application to ourselves now. Lord, do something in our hearts, our spirits, our minds, our lives, our understandings,
18:15 -  that shall forever change us. May this night be a night of such a dealing of God that we shall forever gag and choke and splutter, if we should ever dare to stand before your people and in your name bring
18:30 -  forth something glib, shallow, insincere, coined out of our own skulls, our own little tinsel personalities, our own little cuteness. Mighty God, may we tremble with the responsibilities of what it means to be a royal priesthood.
18:48 -  May we never dare mount a platform except that we come to bring living sacrifice ourselves. Teach us, deal with us, speak the word that's in your heart this night, to save us from going the way of all flesh.
19:08 -  Stand and remind us and restore us and establish us again in the true way, the way of true ministry, true priesthood, true service unto God, and we'll thank you and praise you for it.
19:22 -  In Jesus' holy name we pray, amen. What we're reading, children, is an ordination service. Before the priests could begin their duties, they had to be ordained.
19:39 -  Ordination today is something much less. Some places all it requires is a ten dollar check and an application and you'll get back a certificate.
19:46 -  In others, if they know you and you're a pretty right guy and you're not in any apparent error or blatant apostasy and you seem to have something going for you, you're ordained. God's requirements, as you can see, were very detailed and painstaking.
20:05 -  This was an elaborate ceremony of ordination and consecration. And you would think that these were not priests being established, but butchers. It almost seems that their priestly garments were wholly inappropriate.
20:21 -  They should better have had a butcher's apron, because I'll tell you that when the whole thing was finished, they were almost virtually standing up to their ankles in streams of blood.
20:37 -  But it says, as the Lord commanded Moses, as the Lord commanded Moses, as the Lord commanded Moses, every painstaking detail had its origin in God. And though it boggles the mind, I think it behooves us to see this, because men would
20:56 -  never have conceived of this kind of ceremony. And there must therefore have been purpose in God in requiring the things that he did. There must have been a reason why he assembled the whole congregation at the tent of the
21:09 -  tabernacle, that they might witness this entire process. Because I'll tell you, children, there's a relationship between priests and people. And I think one of the sickliest characteristics of our present-day Christianity is the divorce
21:24 -  which has taken place. We have professionals and quote, unquote, laypeople, vast audiences of people sitting on their rumps looking up, and an individual virtuoso looking down doing his thing.
21:38 -  I don't know if that's quite what God had in mind, but there's a kind of a casualness and ease with people slumped in their seats, either enjoying the kind of spiritual roulette which will come up for that night if it happens to be a happy sermon which they can dig, or
21:55 -  somehow having to bite their lips and change their positions in their seats and wait for the dreary thing to be over. But there's hardly more involvement than that.
22:05 -  But I'll tell you, God says that as the priests, so the people. And if you'll tolerate mediocrity in your priests, if you'll tolerate casual and indifferent service from men who are on the platform, you can be assured that you shall not be long
22:20 -  far behind in resembling and finally imitating and having a character like unto the priests. As the priests, so the people. There's an identity between priests and people, sacred connection, and God showed them by
22:35 -  assembling the people and saying, look what I'm doing to these priests. Look at the detailed things that I'm requiring of them. Look at the heavy responsibility.
22:43 -  Watch, keep your hearts with all diligence. For as the priests are, so also are the people. And when the day comes, that priest shall no longer be able to discern the difference
22:54 -  between the things which are sacred and the things that are profane. It'll be an oeuvre day for you. It'll be woe is me for you.
23:04 -  Because if they can't discern it, how much better do you think you'll be? Because you're the ones that are applauding. You're the ones that are goading them on.
23:14 -  You're the ones that are giggling and jostling and encouraging them in their practices. You're the ones that are sitting there and taking it and enjoying it or tolerating it. As the priests are, so the people.
23:26 -  And therefore he assembled them at the door of the tabernacle to watch what was going on. The first thing he did was to wash Aaron and his sons with water, their hands and their feet. And that's just the beginning of humiliations.
23:40 -  If you don't think so, how would you like tonight to be called up on the platform and be required to take off your shoes and socks? And I would wash your feet publicly before all these people.
23:52 -  It's a humiliation, but it's a necessary requirement. And of course it bespeaks the washing of the water of the word, which is the first approach to true ministry,
24:02 -  and which in fact we're performing tonight now. Maybe at the end of this night there might be one or two ordained, consecrated. And God is speaking a washing of the word on hands and feet
24:16 -  because there's been just a little too much traffic in the world, just a little bit too much of the groovy undertone in the current to be found in the entertainments of the world,
24:24 -  which have found their way also into our services and into our practices. That which has dallied and dabbled in the world needs first to be washed before there's another step taken in the consecration of the priests.
24:39 -  And then the elaborate clothing was put upon them, long under tunic, girded with a long sash, with a robe and an ephod, kind of an upper vest,
24:49 -  all made of linen. In Exodus it says, linen breeches to cover their nakedness.
24:55 -  From the loins unto the sides shall they reach. God was very particular about this. First, no wool garments,
25:03 -  because if a priest ever sweated, he's finished. The day that a priest sweats, he's no longer a priest. The day that he wheels and deals and strives to perform,
25:12 -  puts on a show and has to promote it and do it, that's the end of his priesthood. No sweat, children.
25:20 -  It's the Father who doeth the works. And the linen is the linen of his righteousness, and it covers all flesh.
25:28 -  God was so fastidious about this that he didn't even allow priests to walk up on steps into the Holy of Holies.
25:35 -  They had to go up on a ramp. Lest if they had gone up on steps, they would have had to raise one leg higher than the other
25:42 -  and the cause of which some flesh of their thighs would be revealed. No flesh shall stand in his presence.
25:49 -  Have you got that? N.O. No flesh shall stand in his presence.
25:56 -  Have you really got that? Are you covered from head to toe in the linen of his righteousness?
26:03 -  Don't dare draw near to God or before men and assume holy, priestly responsibility if your flesh is sticking out.
26:18 -  Skillfully woven cords attached the ephod to the priest, binding it to him. I looked it up, they were blue cords,
26:25 -  and blue is the color of Deity and it's the color of truth. The priest's garments weren't some kind of
26:34 -  quick, icky thing like stepping into a phone booth and putting on your Superman costume and ipso facto changed.
26:42 -  That's the way it's been up till now, but I tell you children, God is no longer winking. He doesn't care too much for this business
26:48 -  of being one thing publicly and another thing privately. Put on and take off. He's calling for priesthood
26:55 -  where the holy garments are attached to the very body of the priest, tied on. You're on view always.
27:02 -  You're always God's man, always God's servant, always the high calling of God, always the integrity of God for things large, things small, things public,
27:10 -  things private, things seen, things unseen. You still willing to be a priest? No little groovy change of costume thing.
27:19 -  It's bound to your very body. And on the turban upon the head, there was a shining gold plate
27:26 -  and on it was written, holiness unto the Lord. Hallelujah.
27:32 -  May we feel the weight of that plate slapping back and forth as we walk about in the performance of our duties.
27:39 -  A continual reminder, just a heft in the weight of it, holiness unto the Lord. Unto the Lord.
27:45 -  Unto the Lord. There's a reason, children, for everything that's here. There was only one portion of the body of the priest
27:57 -  that was at all exposed for the holy anointing oil, which is spoken of in the eleventh verse,
28:04 -  poured, sprinkled seven times and then upon the head of Aaron and down his beard and then to the hem of his garment
28:11 -  poured, sprinkled seven times and then upon the head of Aaron and down his beard and then to the hem of his garment
28:17 -  had only one place where it could make contact with flesh and that was the head of the priest, the head of the body.
28:25 -  And so is it also to this day. Only one place exposed. Only one head that can stand
28:32 -  before God the Father. So one with him, so sharing his essential character and purity and holiness
28:40 -  that the holy anointing oil can make direct contact. But in everything else, other than the head,
28:48 -  from the neck to the tops of the toes, the body of Christ must be covered in the linen of God's righteousness.
28:55 -  Upon man's flesh it shall not be poured. And that's why, children, the decibels are rising. That's why the noise is becoming more strident.
29:04 -  That's why there's increasing clamor and activity and programs and all the kinds of jazz. You can count on it.
29:11 -  As the anointing of God subsides, as more and more flesh is revealed, as God will not allow his holy anointing oil
29:19 -  to be poured upon man's flesh, men who sense somehow intuitively the absence of the unction of God
29:26 -  for which no entertainments are required shall be required to fill the silencers with their own activities, their own noise,
29:33 -  their own clamor. May God give you priestly discernment to sense the difference
29:41 -  and to be on guard and keep the sanctity of the temple. And so the anointing oil came upon Aaron's head
29:51 -  and upon his sons. And then we read of a succession of sacrifices, bulls which Moses killed and poured the blood
29:58 -  at the base of the altar and consecrated it. And he took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver
30:04 -  and the two kidneys with the fat and Moses burned them on the altar. But the bull, its hide, its flesh, its dung,
30:09 -  he burned with fire outside the camp. Doesn't that just controvert our own human wisdom and reckoning?
30:16 -  Wouldn't we have thought the flesh the most valuable part of the sacrifice? Wouldn't that be the portion
30:22 -  that should have been burned on the altar and the hide probably could have been sold? But God counts the hide as just the near exterior.
30:30 -  That's the place of superficiality. There's only one place for it. It's the dung heap outside the camp.
30:36 -  No sacrifice to God shall ever be performed from that. And as far as the flesh is concerned, you know what God thinks of that.
30:43 -  He equates it with dung. Skin, flesh and dung burned outside. But the things we would despise,
30:50 -  the things that to us are despicable, the things for which we have no appetite, that God celebrates.
30:56 -  The lobe of the liver, the kidneys, the kishkas, the lowly organs, which are the seed of life.
31:05 -  Which have to do with the purification of blood that God puts on the altar of sacrifice. His way is not our way, children,
31:14 -  nor are His thoughts our thoughts. And I'll tell you what. You love truth.
31:20 -  You love true service. You had better start adjusting your life, your walk and your ministry
31:26 -  in keeping with the things as He sees them. Rather than that which is popular and has become universal,
31:34 -  and has become universally accepted in our own generation. I'll tell you that true ministry
31:40 -  will always require you to handle despicable things. We'll always want to reach for the things
31:46 -  that look lovely and inviting. But I'll tell you that the real life is in the kishkas.
31:51 -  The real life is in the thing from which we would ordinarily draw back. It's not going to be in the places
31:57 -  that are popular and approved and ringing with applause, but I think they're going to be
32:03 -  in the places, the unesteemed places where God will be bringing forth
32:09 -  the deepest and truest end-time priestly ministries to the end of the age. That's just a suspicion that I have.
32:19 -  And then in the 18th verse, another sacrifice, a ram for burnt offering, Aaron and his sons laid their hands
32:25 -  on the head of the ram. You know why? It was an act of identification.
32:31 -  I'm unfit. I'm unworthy. I deserve judgment.
32:37 -  How do I presume piece of dust that I am to stand before you and to invoke
32:43 -  and to perform holy things? No way. But I thank you, precious God,
32:49 -  that in your wisdom you accept this substitute. And by the laying of my hands on that animal,
32:55 -  high-spirited animal, independent, kind of rebellious, in which I see what is my own frame,
33:01 -  I recognize the necessity for that death. Because so long as that kind of
33:07 -  independence continues, so long as that kind of egotism and self-will goes on,
33:13 -  there's no way to be your priest. By the act of identification now and this death now,
33:19 -  I see myself as wholly dead and cut off that the priestly ministry may be by Christ Jesus.
33:25 -  Moses killed it. Cut the ram into pieces and burned the head to pieces
33:31 -  and the fat, washed the entrails, legs and water. Man, what gooey, icky stuff. The great Moses,
33:37 -  having to do with entrails and things like that, standing already in a pool of slippery blood
33:43 -  with the things crudded under his fingernails. Hey, you don't like that? They didn't tell you that?
33:49 -  Did they give you a far more fetching picture of what ministry to God was going to be in the end times? And you saw yourself in glorious places
33:55 -  swaying back and forth under the power of your great preaching and ministry? Let me tell you, children,
34:01 -  if there's no blood under your fingernails and icky crud and you're not slipping and sliding
34:07 -  on the floor that's made wet by the blood of sacrifice, you've probably missed it.
34:17 -  And so we brought the other ram, the ram of consecration, in the 22nd verse and they laid their hands upon it again
34:23 -  and the great Moses killed it and took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear,
34:29 -  on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot. Isn't that foolishness?
34:35 -  And they did the same thing to Aaron's sons. Let me ask you a question tonight. Is the blood of Jesus on your right ear?
34:41 -  What are you hearing and to what do you give your attention and obedience?
34:47 -  Oh, I can tell you stories, children, if I had time and you had the patience to have the blood of the Lord on your right ear.
34:53 -  How would you like during the time of the Kent State murders to have been scheduled
34:59 -  for an open-air Gospel encounter at a great university in Chicago to find that it,
35:05 -  together with other universities across the land, were on strike? Students under the hypnotic power of satanic spirits
35:11 -  in the name of justice and righteousness had taken over the campus and you got there in a hot, boiling day
35:17 -  and found out that you couldn't perform your ministry. The strike committee had taken it over
35:23 -  and you pleaded with them that you had reserved that amphitheater and they're not even listening to you.
35:29 -  Man, there's a gleam in their eyes and you know the origin of it. They're intoxicated with the power
35:35 -  of having shut down a great university. And so finally, by the wisdom of God, you say to them, listen,
35:41 -  I love peace also. How about giving me at least 10 minutes on the program? So they did your favor and they gave you 10 minutes.
35:47 -  But yet I said 2 hours in the blowing sun waiting for your opportunity. And listen to the filthiest
35:53 -  parade of incitement to violence, filth,
36:01 -  harangues, blasphemy that you've ever heard. Your soul is just sick
36:07 -  in the hearing of it all the more because it's a reminder that not too long ago before the Lord found you,
36:13 -  you used to speak those vile things too. When you hear your name shouted, Cat, Cat, is he in the audience?
36:19 -  And cats come staggering out. Heat prostration, sunstroke,
36:25 -  kishkas tied in knots hearing all these filthy things, mind all fogged up, unable to think,
36:31 -  wondering what you're doing here, reeling, and a microphone is thrust into your hand. And you stand in the middle of that amphitheater
36:37 -  for the first time and you look at the bodies all around you. Whether it's the heat or your condition
36:43 -  or just the peculiarity of being Jewish, it seems to you as if the bodies are in recline.
36:49 -  They're not sitting upright, they look like sinuous snakes intertwining. And what helps the scene is the litter,
36:55 -  the lunch bags and the newspapers and the leaflets completely filling that arena
37:01 -  with just a scene of bedlam and disorder and confusion, the architects of a brave new world. Tell me children, what would you say
37:07 -  in that moment? What ministry would you perform then? What glib thing would you speak then?
37:15 -  How cute and fetching would you be then? Trusting God because it's ministry by Christ Jesus.
37:25 -  I opened my mouth and I heard myself saying that I'm a Jew who's had a lifelong concern
37:31 -  for social justice. But having sat for two hours listening to these speeches, I have to say that
37:37 -  I have to say that it has confirmed what I have all along believed that our so-called solutions
37:43 -  are just so much batting at the air, near-vein ceremony. And you who profess to be concerned
37:49 -  for the death of four students have your own mouths and throats filled with murder and with violence.
37:57 -  And the shouts began to go up, give us parables, how do they get that microphone? What does this got to do with the strike?
38:03 -  And I said, oh you guys want a revolution? Right on. But it's got to begin with you.
38:09 -  In your own filthy hearts, in your own murderous hearts, in the name of justice, ready to bring down
38:15 -  an entire civilization in an effort where you should have heard the shrieks and the howls. It happens, children, every time
38:21 -  you sacrifice animals. It happens every time you stick that knife into flesh. Whoo!
38:27 -  You should have heard the shrieks. You should have heard the screams. Hey! How did he get that microphone?
38:33 -  He's a rabbit! And I'll tell you what, children, the day is not far off and we're going to hear
38:39 -  crucify him! I remember sitting that afternoon on the grass talking with as many students
38:47 -  who were interested to speak with me, peculiar Jewish freaks that I was, speaking those strange things
38:53 -  in that environment. My Bible had burst at the seams and it had a piece of black magic tape on it
38:59 -  and I was sitting on my Bible and when I got up I had a big black stripe across the seat of my pants.
39:07 -  I was stunned at the treatment that I had received by men who claimed to love justice. And that night I spoke in a great
39:13 -  Pentecostal church in that city. Man, 15 churches were represented. They were spilling over
39:21 -  and you should have seen those pastors that night sitting together with me on the platform. What a contrast.
39:27 -  Man, what a sorry mess I looked. I had no time to wash my face. There was that black stripe on the seat of my pants
39:33 -  which I hope no one was going to see and I noticed for the first time that the pants I was wearing had one leg
39:39 -  a little bit more faded than the other. That's how I got it at Klein's basement. But the other guys, wow,
39:47 -  they were sparkling. Pastel colored shirts and well manicured sideburns and they were just
39:53 -  real groovy. And that night they had a popular pastor contest. And I had to wait through that.
40:01 -  It took at least a half hour and if someone did their Sunday school room they got so many points that they washed their cars
40:07 -  shined their shoes and the pastor at the most points won well it happened to be a tie and then they had a runoff
40:15 -  and I was thinking to myself thank you Lord that not one radical student
40:21 -  not one Jewish student whom I had invited to come this night to see modern Christianity came
40:27 -  thank you Lord because if they had come every worst suspicion
40:33 -  and prejudice would have been confirmed thank you that they didn't come well I had gotten my instructions at night
40:39 -  hey Art give them your testimony boy your testimony that's a real lulu
40:45 -  send them home rah rah rah but while I was sitting on the platform in my right ear
40:51 -  I think it was I heard a still small voice it said Art preach on the cross
40:58 -  Art preach on the cross Art preach on the cross and you sort of heard the mumling
41:04 -  that was going on Lord look at my condition I'm suffering from heat prostration
41:10 -  and I haven't got it together Lord my mind is beggarly I'm just confused and bewildered Lord
41:16 -  and when I look out on these middle class happy little faces I see through them long haired freaky types
41:22 -  wild and demoniacal Lord from this hot afternoon's encounter Art preach on the cross
41:28 -  but Lord they don't even have Bibles they've just come for a happy time Lord preach on the cross
41:34 -  but Lord have you seen that from Urbana Illinois and from Wheaton and other places men who know me and love me and respect me
41:40 -  and think that I've got some ministry they've come tonight Lord my reputation is on the line
41:46 -  Art preach on the cross but Lord I've never preached on the cross as you want me to preach tonight
41:52 -  I've had such a message and I'm certainly not in a position to prepare it Art preach on the cross
41:58 -  let me ask you children when God has his blood in your right ear it's not sweet little nothings
42:04 -  that he's going to whisper there it's going to be painful invitations to obedience the cost of which may be
42:10 -  the loss of reputation the loss of friends the loss of support
42:16 -  embarrassment, mortification, suffering and death still want to be a priest and have his blood on your right ear
42:26 -  well Art what happened that night I preached on the cross it was like a man coming to his death
42:32 -  all they had to do was give me a blindfold and a cigarette I sagged when I came to that pulpit it's not so groovy
42:46 -  and I cried out oh God it was just a weary sigh
42:52 -  children and that's what it's going to be often a weary sigh
42:58 -  in being God's priest you'll think yourself more a butcher than some kind of celebrated personality
43:06 -  I said to these people I've been asked to give my testimony tonight but there's been a still small voice speaking
43:14 -  let's pray together and see what the spirit of God wants and we prayed and I said now now that we've prayed we're all ruled by the same spirit
43:20 -  how many people feel I ought to give my testimony one hand went up how many people feel that I ought to
43:26 -  preach on the cross they all came up and I took a deep breath
43:32 -  tired shocked, wiped out mindless
43:38 -  trembling and the moment I opened my mouth and lifted my head tremendous unction from God came upon me
43:44 -  and I sailed through a 45 minute message on the cross that you think that I had rehearsed hundreds of times
43:50 -  and I'd never spoken before and when I finished nobody had to give an invitation they were sprawled out
43:56 -  through the aisles, over the seats, over the steps since some kind of a bomb had gone off blood splattered everywhere
44:02 -  those groovy passes with their ties backwards and their pastel collars and sideburns were all messed up
44:08 -  and they were bawling and croaking and groaning and dying and sagging God raised up
44:14 -  the cross of Christ Jesus you got a little blood on your ear children? I spoke last night
44:22 -  for those who were here of foolishness that God requires in obedience that sometimes
44:28 -  has not even to do with speaking I told the audience last night how I came to a Pentecostal congregation in Germany
44:34 -  you couldn't think of anything more staid, more respectable, more solemn more wanting a heavy word from God
44:40 -  and before I even got up to the platform I was carrying on and cavorting like a clown and a fool
44:46 -  and frolicking and leaping and clicking my heels and they thought that this was some kind of an American jackass, a clown
44:52 -  and what had come to them and in the midst of their murmurings, which I knew I turned and faced them and said
44:58 -  you Pharisees murmuring because you think that God had failed to bring you the word
45:04 -  and that you required somehow to tolerate American clowns but I'll tell you that God has brought you the word
45:10 -  made flesh you know what happened that night? they repented on their faces
45:16 -  for the absence of the joy and the spontaneity and the freedom and the life
45:22 -  which God revealed to them in the frolicking foolishness of American clowns
45:28 -  still got you right here? I think I told you on the first night coming to an American army chapel
45:34 -  and I can repeat these illustrations sitting so uncomfortably on the platform waiting to be called on
45:40 -  listening to a time of praise and worship which was horrendous and was more reminiscent of a stockyard
45:46 -  of cattle bellowing bull snorting than it was God's people praising God in the spirit
45:52 -  and only to find out that in the past I got up some young whiz kid whose career is on the up who said isn't it
45:58 -  wonderful to worship God in the spirit and I clutched my gut and almost doubled over and I was going to speak to that people
46:04 -  that night but the Lord had my ear and then I tried to flee
46:10 -  I looked for a hole in the floor to fall through some exit to which I could escape not so
46:16 -  when the time of speaking came I want you to know it was horrendous I told them exactly what was my impression
46:22 -  I said it sounded more like a stockyard of the bellowing of animals some kind of cathodic exercise
46:28 -  of a bunch of fleshly carnal Christians who beat their wives and yell at their kids and have one opportunity on a Sunday night
46:34 -  somehow to bellow thinking that that's going to release the crud
46:40 -  more psychic and emotional release than it is worship and they didn't even know it
46:46 -  well you know what the end of that was people weeping broken before God the moment I started speaking those horrendous things
46:52 -  a hush came over that room and they knew it was the Lord or how did you come to another situation
47:01 -  speaking how would you like to be thought of as an oracle and invited to a significant charismatic fellowship
47:07 -  that had just undertaken an expensive building program and had heard you in Jerusalem
47:13 -  and thought that you were some instrument of God who was going to speak to them direction for their future and you thought so too
47:19 -  you would not have come and the day finally has arrived and you've come to the community
47:25 -  and you have a wonderful sweet peace in your heart absolute confidence that God is going to deliver the goods
47:31 -  He always has and they put you up in the motel room and you go down on your face and seek the Lord
47:37 -  waiting for that precious whispering in that right ear this is the way walking in it this is the word, this is the theme
47:43 -  and there's no whisper well there's still plenty of time driving to the service that first night
47:49 -  waiting for the Lord to whisper while you drive as He has so often done it just the word, just the scripture
47:55 -  nothing, still a peace going into the prayer room and finally having it out with the Lord
48:01 -  now look Lord, enough is enough the hour is late, the time is urgent this isn't some charismatic patsy
48:09 -  that you've got here, this is our baby, this is your boy we're here for a real
48:19 -  significant encounter mighty God you know that I'm not available for anything else
48:25 -  so let's have it already what is it that we shall stake? silence
48:31 -  and then you sit on the front pew waiting to be called on seconds away from having your name announced
48:37 -  and you've got your Bible between your hands clutching it furiously with the sweat oozing out of the palms
48:43 -  not very priestly hoping against hope that by osmosis something will come through the covers
48:49 -  boy, I hope that there are wholesale resignations tonight from those who thought themselves ministers this is it guys
48:55 -  I'm a frontiersman, I'm giving it to you straight this is what end time ministry is going to be mortifying, fearful, horrendous
49:01 -  not always groovy sick feelings when you know you've delivered the word of God and it comes crashing back at your teeth
49:07 -  because the people will not have it or I'll tell you something even worse I've got to go
49:13 -  I've got to go I've got to go we got to do it
49:19 -  I said, give us a special report I said, give us a special report and then they will defend it
49:25 -  or I'll tell them something even worse they come by at the end take your hand as you stand by there
49:31 -  they say Thank you for that nice message if you went to God they would slap you in the teeth rather than speak that
49:37 -  because it wasn't at all nice and so they called me up on the platform and the lord had yet not spoken
49:44 -  into my right ear here are your people, here is your servant we are waiting on you precious God
49:50 -  we know that we are at the end of the age and we want to hear what's in your heart and I lifted my head children
49:56 -  and I had nothing and I had nothing I'll tell you when you know that God has your ear
50:02 -  not only will you hear him when he speaks to things that are unpopular and the things which you don't want to do
50:08 -  and the things which are tedious and the things which will not bring you applause and the things that will be misunderstood
50:14 -  but you'll not hear things which he has not spoken either do you know that? you'll not perform that which he has not called you to do either
50:20 -  and I've been brought up to pass these situations where men have expected certain things from me and they're not going to get it
50:26 -  if he has not spoken in my ear but let me ask you a question tonight you young aspiring ministers
50:32 -  what would you have done had you been in my shoes can you picture it a crowded room like this
50:38 -  and you can't imagine you can't imagine a room like this
50:44 -  such expectancy that you could cut it with a knife people who have come from 50, 75
50:50 -  100 miles, one way to hear the oracle of God microphones and tape recorders
50:58 -  all over the place, poised ready to catch every jewel that will fall from your lips and you've prayed
51:04 -  and you know that God has not spoken a thing in your ear, there's nothing to say what would you do?
51:10 -  you know what Satan is doing he's reminding you of all of the great sermons that you have man you can preach on Acts 16
51:16 -  you can preach on this, you can preach that terrific messages given of God they've brought blessing to God's people
51:24 -  again and again and again so why not just take one of them out now and serve it up
51:30 -  well you would but God said that if there's anything left over
51:36 -  in the 32nd verse what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire you can't use yesterday's
51:42 -  ministry for today you can't use yesterday's sacrifice for today you're not going to just warm up some stale stuff
51:50 -  and be a priest of God in holy service with me children
51:56 -  what would you do then? there's only one thing to do is let your face stick out
52:04 -  and I hope that you'll have the experience and you'll wish that the floor would open to swallow you
52:12 -  you would to God that you were a thousand other places you'll have hot and cold things shooting through you
52:18 -  knees knocking and I'll tell you the most horrendous thing of all it beats being attacked by rabbis
52:24 -  it beats radical university audiences ready to flay the flesh from your bones it's looking into the disappointed
52:30 -  faces of God's people and saying I have nothing take one look at those faces
52:36 -  and you'll welcome the rabbis and the radical students any day what horror
52:42 -  you know what their faces are saying? hey man, I thought you were an oracle of God what's the matter?
52:48 -  don't you pray? got a little secret sin in your life maybe? or this is
52:54 -  you're just casual and indifferent you thought that this was some entertainment hey man, don't you pray
53:00 -  don't you pray this is some entertainment hey man, don't you have any messages?
53:06 -  and you know what children you can't answer them a word you have only to take it
53:14 -  that's priesthood unto God and not unto men
53:20 -  well what happened that night that was only the beginning don't you love to sing
53:26 -  let us wait upon the Lord boy I know you probably sing it beautifully but do you do it as well
53:34 -  waiting is dying children especially when there are several hundred faces shooting dirty looks at you
53:40 -  and every second is ticking away like an eternity tick tock
53:46 -  tick tock and you're standing there utterly alone
53:52 -  and God is not giving you any answers or explanations still want to be a priest?
53:58 -  hey man, we'll sign you up in three months we'll give you a groovy preparation in discipleship and send you packing
54:05 -  to serve the Lord and you'll probably be serving yourself at the same time
54:13 -  well Art, what happened well when it seemed like an unbearable eternity
54:19 -  some man got up with great tremblings who I learned later had never before ever spoken publicly in the congregation
54:25 -  he was shaking like a leaf and he said, brother Katz our hearts stopped beating to hear what he was going to say
54:31 -  was this God now going to take over brother Katz he said I have a scripture
54:37 -  could this be it? and I sighed relief in her yes Lord, what?
54:43 -  and he spoke a scripture mamma mia, juicy pregnant, redolent
54:49 -  loaded out of Philippians you had to be an idiot
54:55 -  not to be able to spin off a message from that scripture right on the spot but it was a no no
55:01 -  it was not to be spoken from and I had to say, no brother, that's not it talk about a man dying
55:07 -  clunk, and the whole congregation died with him well what did you do after that? we waited
55:13 -  and waited and waited and waited and waited
55:19 -  and waited and waited waited, waited, waited, waited you're laughing now children, but I can tell you then
55:27 -  it was anything but a laughing matter I'll tell you that the resentments were beginning to mount and the atmosphere
55:33 -  which had been so happily charismatic at the beginning was now turning to quite something else
55:39 -  tense angry, resentful the Lord was surfacing
55:45 -  the true condition of that people at my expense, thank you
55:53 -  that's what it means to be a priest unto the Lord and finally
55:59 -  when it was absolutely unbearable when you're ready to burst a vein so a woman on the other side of the congregation
56:05 -  got up with great trembling, and she said, brother Kat I have a scripture, could this be it? and oh hallelujah at last
56:11 -  and she gave a scripture but it was not it you want to know something children?
56:21 -  are you prepared for this? God prompted both people to give those scriptures they were not in the flesh
56:27 -  they were in the spirit but they were not to be spoken from are you that obedient?
56:33 -  that discerning? have you got that much intimacy in the knowledge of God
56:39 -  that much time in the place of holy of holies will you begin to see as he sees
56:45 -  and hear as he hears are you willing to discernment? are you willing to suffer
56:51 -  seeing as God sees? are you willing to have your stomach tied in knots when everybody else is having a charismatic ball
56:57 -  and you can't enter in because God can't enter in either willing?
57:05 -  that's a priest's discernment children and it's not always pleasant what makes it even doubly unpleasant
57:13 -  is having publicly to express it to the very congregation who thought they were having a real
57:19 -  ball of the time worshiping the Lord that's priestly service well finally when it seemed like
57:27 -  we were at the end of ourselves out of death how many animals were sacrificed have we read?
57:33 -  animal after animal after animal knee high in blood and gore death death death
57:39 -  to bring forth life have you forgotten that? do you think that it will ever be obtained
57:45 -  by anything less? you think that groovy personality and winsomeness and cleverness is ever going to be a substitute
57:51 -  for that life which coming from death in that last possible moment there came a breaking from someone
58:00 -  in the congregation in utterance in tongues and interpretation and God began to stir something in my heart
58:06 -  and we were off and before that night was over you know what God had given us? He didn't give us a meeting
58:13 -  He didn't give us an event He gave us a holy encounter He gave us a knife not to be forgotten
58:19 -  He gave us a demonstration and a revelation of His glory it came out of a lot of blood
58:29 -  and that's the way I think it has always become because God's way has not changed only we
58:39 -  the 31st verse reminds us that Moses said to Aaron and his sons
58:45 -  boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecration and ordination as I commanded
58:51 -  saying Aaron and his sons shall eat it you know what children? I'm going to have to live
58:57 -  with what I'm speaking to you tonight my last opportunity you would think that a man would have taken the opportunity
59:03 -  to ensure his popularity and guarantee his return visit man I could think of a dozen messages
59:09 -  that would have had you slapping me on the back from here to the exit and applauding me
59:15 -  as one of the greatest fellows that has ever come by and spoken from this pulpit but you know what I'm doing tonight
59:21 -  I believe with all my heart that I'm being obedient to the Lord in priestly service
59:27 -  but I'll tell you what it's going to require I'm going to have to eat this I'm going to have to live with this
59:33 -  I had to live with that night in that Pentecostal chapel in Germany what if I had known that they were bellowing like animals
59:39 -  what if I had missed God what if it was me and not God what if it was my cantankerous Jewish personality
59:45 -  or some residual resentment against Gentiles and I was really venting myself I would have to eat that
59:53 -  I'll tell you it's not pleasant going down what if it was me and not God that had me standing on that platform in Jerusalem
59:59 -  on the last night of that Holy Spirit conference when I was not a scheduled speaker and went on speaking over an hour
01:00:05 -  they thought that I should have been finished after 15 minutes and kept Kathryn Kuhlman waiting in the wings stomping like a tiger
01:00:11 -  and a whole platform of men angry and bitter and resentful at me because they couldn't take the real offering that they wanted to take
01:00:17 -  because I had consumed so much of their time I'll tell you if that was not God I'd have to eat it
01:00:23 -  and I'll tell you what children I'm eating it still I've lost friends from it still there's been a strangement from it still
01:00:29 -  there shall be never a reconciliation with some men who were so turned off that night because I believed I was being obedient to God
01:00:37 -  you have to eat it you're going to have to eat your sacrifice and eat your service
01:00:43 -  maybe that will give us pause for thought whether it's light and frivolous and playing fun and games
01:00:49 -  or whether we're doing serious things before God and men you're going to have to eat it
01:00:55 -  Aaron and his son shall eat it and it's true now as it was then I'll tell you I'm taking my life in my hands
01:01:01 -  tonight I'm risking permanent offence
01:01:09 -  turning off young people and maybe making some young guy who's been having a terrific time in ministry up to now
01:01:19 -  so apprehensive now so self-conscious that he's going to lose his charm I'm risking it
01:01:25 -  I'm going to have to eat that but I'm risking that there'll be a glory
01:01:31 -  if he receives what God is saying we have to eat our ministry children it's not a light matter
01:01:39 -  and you shall not go out of the door of the tent to the meeting for seven days until the day of the consecration and ordination are ended
01:01:45 -  for it will take seven days to consecrate and ordain you as has been done this day so the Lord has commanded
01:01:51 -  to do for your atonement at the door of the tent of meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days
01:01:57 -  the Lord has charged you to do that you die not for so am I commanded so Aaron and the sons did all the things which the Lord commanded by Moses
01:02:05 -  seven is a perfect number have you waited seven days before you've begun your ministry
01:02:11 -  have you had seven days in the holy place have you had seven days to contemplate the significance
01:02:17 -  the meaning the responsibility the awesome wait of serving God
01:02:23 -  before you've launched forth will you be patient to wait for God's perfect moment
01:02:29 -  before you begin oh you can be gifted, talented
01:02:35 -  inspired, dedicated, wanting to do but is it God's moment yet to unveil you
01:02:41 -  I praise God for the obedience of Elijah
01:02:47 -  imagine how it must have been felt for him watching every one of the prophets being slain by
01:02:53 -  Jezebel because he cried out later said Lord I alone am left well how's it feel to be the only Jewish fellow
01:02:59 -  left and watching all of your Jewish colleagues getting hacked to pieces and Satan and others are saying hey man aren't you
01:03:05 -  supposed to be a prophet get out there and face the action look what's happening to your brothers what are you doing
01:03:13 -  hiding remember when Jesus was told that Lazarus was sick and he loved
01:03:19 -  Lazarus and we read and Jesus heard that and tarried
01:03:25 -  two days longer where he was that's a priest every human reckoning
01:03:31 -  every evangelical reckoning hey man get with it lay hands on the sick heal them
01:03:37 -  minister but the father had not yet spoken go he allowed his friend to languish
01:03:45 -  in sickness and in death what is for the glory
01:03:51 -  of God I'll tell you children you'll never wait unless you have his glory for most
01:03:57 -  there's an itch to do an itch to be seen an itch to be heard if your glory is still lingering around
01:04:03 -  it's a man who has been divested from any quest for his own glory who wants only to see
01:04:09 -  the glory of God who when he laid his hand on those rams and on those animals really saw himself as done in and dead
01:04:15 -  hacked to pieces having no life unto himself only such a one as that can wait that perfect time
01:04:21 -  and you know what happened there came a perfect moment when God called a wilderness prophet
01:04:27 -  out of obscurity and he stood before the Ahab of his generation and said as the Lord my God
01:04:33 -  lives before whom I stand it shall not reign nor do but according to my word never a man spoke like that
01:04:39 -  he sounded like very God commanding the elements he invoked fire from heaven
01:04:45 -  he brought an apostate filthy backslidden people down on their faces he single handedly slew
01:04:51 -  the false prophets of Baal whap whap whap God brought a man
01:04:57 -  out of hiddenness and out of obscurity in a perfect moment according to his command
01:05:03 -  and with a few strokes he changed divine history I'm willing to
01:05:09 -  wait for that I'd rather be silent unheard I'd rather be unseen unspoken
01:05:15 -  until the seventh day is finished and God shall call me forth in the perfect moment
01:05:21 -  and while I'm waiting I will enjoy abiding in the holy place in his presence
01:05:27 -  which is where the priest ought to wait that they might gain something of his perspective and his discernment in the moment
01:05:33 -  that he'll call them forth you know what the word consecrate means it means fill your hands
01:05:39 -  with blood when this chapter was over you never saw a bloodier looking priesthood
01:05:45 -  they were splattered from head to toe dripping with blood and gore if we had time to look at it
01:05:55 -  and I'll tell you to look at it privately on your own look up the day that God consecrated Levites to be priests
01:06:01 -  it was the day that Moses came down from the mountain and found Israel dancing around a golden calf
01:06:07 -  they rose up to eat they came to have fun fun and games
01:06:13 -  there was a lot of noise and Joshua thought it was the sound of singing the sound of battle but no
01:06:19 -  it was singing, it was fun and games and when he saw that revelry that desecration
01:06:27 -  he said one thing he said who's on the Lord's side and the Levites got up and stood by Moses
01:06:33 -  and Moses said put on your sword and every one of you go in and out of the camp
01:06:39 -  and every man slay his neighbor, his brother, his friend three thousand Jews were killed
01:06:47 -  by the hands of their own brethren in obedience to God you know what God said about that
01:06:53 -  this day have I consecrated you for my priesthood put on your sword and go in and out of the camp and slay that one who is
01:07:01 -  who is eating and drinking and rising up to play who's on the Lord's side I'll tell your children what priestly service
01:07:07 -  is going to require at the end of the age not just ministering in the world where they shall shoot
01:07:13 -  dirty looks at you but often times you're going to be required to draw the blood of your friends, your neighbors
01:07:19 -  your own family are you on the Lord's side? if you're not and you're not willing to put on the sword
01:07:25 -  and go in and out of the camp and slay every man his brother you cannot be a consecrated priest
01:07:31 -  it began in blood, it continues in blood and it shall end in blood now I'll just take a moment to the ninth chapter
01:07:37 -  to show you the conclusion of the matter on the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel
01:07:43 -  and he said to Aaron take a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for burnt offering without blemish and offer them before the Lord
01:07:51 -  take a male goat for a sin offering a calf, a lamb, a year old without blemish for burnt offering a bull, a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord
01:07:57 -  a cereal offering mixed with oil not that unctuous giddy stuff
01:08:03 -  squealing voices and personality not that kind of oil holy oil
01:08:09 -  for today the Lord will appear to you children it's worth waiting for the eighth day it's worth waiting for the resurrection day
01:08:15 -  it's worth waiting for the perfect moment when God shall call you forth and when he does, guess what
01:08:21 -  it shall be in continuous keeping with what you've already known is implied in true service
01:08:27 -  more sacrifice, more bloodshed, more animals it's time to read this chapter it's sacrificed so Aaron drew near the altar
01:08:33 -  and killed the calf for the sin offering and he poured the blood on the altar's face and he killed the burnt offering in the 12th verse
01:08:39 -  and his sons delivered him the bloody week he dashed round about the altar and they brought him the burnt offering piece by piece
01:08:45 -  and they had an Aaron burning him on the altar the entrails, legs, ugh he presented the people's offering
01:08:51 -  he took the goat for a sin offering and killed it and offered it for sin presented the burnt offering according to the ordinance
01:08:57 -  killed the bull in the 18th verse the sacrifice of peace offerings and his sons presented him the blood which he dashed upon the altar
01:09:06 -  blood, blood, blood sacrifices, whack pieces of hacked up animals
01:09:12 -  waved by the priests men have you ever seen anything more patently foolish more humiliating
01:09:18 -  more incongruous more offensive to human sensibility but you know what the end of it was
01:09:26 -  after the breast and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering as the Lord commanded
01:09:32 -  then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from the altar after offering
01:09:38 -  the sin offering, the burnt offering and the peace offerings and Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and when they came out they blessed the people
01:09:44 -  and the glory of the Lord the Shekinah cloud appeared to all the people as promised
01:09:50 -  can you picture the scene at the conclusion on the eighth day the day of new beginnings, the day of resurrection life
01:09:57 -  the day of God's perfect calling forth punctuated by blood, by screams by shrieks of animals
01:10:05 -  by things waved, by things ludicrous by flesh and blood and guts in your fingernails and the priest lifted his hands
01:10:13 -  at the end over the congregation and blessed them I'll tell you what children
01:10:19 -  there's not a cotton picking way you'll ever bless God's people except your hands be dipped in blood if it costs nothing and there's no sacrifice
01:10:25 -  there's no blessing or there may be a titillation there may be a feeling
01:10:31 -  there may be a momentary enthusiasm but I'm talking about the blessedness of God which is eternal
01:10:37 -  when he held those bloody hands up with the blood dripping down his elbows with the gore then the Shekinah cloud appeared
01:10:43 -  to all the people then there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar
01:10:49 -  and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces hallelujah, that's what I'm waiting for
01:10:55 -  you can keep your chintzy evangelism you can keep your door to door stuff I'm waiting for the glory of God
01:11:03 -  to be made manifest on the earth and it shall not come except such conditions as these
01:11:09 -  be fulfilled it's not a glib and an easy thing it's expensive and costly
01:11:15 -  it's exhausting and tiring it's self-effacing and demeaning but it eventuates
01:11:21 -  in the manifestation of the glory of God that brings people on their faces isn't that what God said today
01:11:27 -  the Lord will appear to you if you do all that God has commanded not always pleasant
01:11:33 -  hard, unpleasant, gritty routine, mean, despised irksome, revolting
01:11:39 -  distasteful that's often what priestly service shall mean but you know what
01:11:45 -  there's a high priest who came before us and was obedient in doing all those things
01:11:51 -  irksome, distasteful revolting he was himself to sacrifice
01:11:57 -  there's no shortcuts children we were called by his name or required to walk even as he walked
01:12:03 -  who's on the Lord's side tonight and will strap on their swords and go in and out of the camp
01:12:09 -  oh I'll tell you the blood will fly mamma mia it's going to be something
01:12:15 -  and I'll just tell you this in my last moment watch out for Leviticus 10
01:12:21 -  will you do it? watch out because two hot shot young sons of Aaron seeing the glory of God
01:12:27 -  brought down by the obedience of their father in accordance with all that God had commanded him
01:12:33 -  note they did they put incense in their pans and went in and offered strange and unholy fire before the Lord
01:12:39 -  as he had not commanded them and there came forth fire
01:12:45 -  from before the Lord and kindled them killed them and they died before the Lord my will not your own
01:12:51 -  God said I shall be consecrated before you hallowed by those who come near me
01:12:57 -  I will be honored and Aaron said nothing two hot shot sons
01:13:03 -  hey look what dad did I'm going to try it they were priests
01:13:09 -  they were called they were of age they were even required to conduct
01:13:15 -  the sacrifice of incense but they came at their own initiative in their own time
01:13:21 -  for their own ends and God consented I think he's going to do it again
01:13:27 -  in fact he may have done it already tonight a little fire has fallen and then maybe one or two hot shots put out of action
01:13:35 -  but out of the ashes let's pray that they'll be a true and holy priesthood you know what a true priesthood is children
01:13:43 -  nothing more nothing less than that which God has commanded
01:13:49 -  it's not always groovy but you also as library stones are built up a spiritual house
01:13:55 -  a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
01:14:01 -  not men by, not you, him Christ Jesus want to be a priest
01:14:07 -  whew blood up to the elbows horrendous shrieks of people
01:14:13 -  disappointed faces silence when you should be speaking and speaking beyond your courage
01:14:19 -  antics and frolicking and kicking your heels when it praises God
01:14:25 -  who has put the blood in your ear, your hands in your feet take you places where you don't want to go and perform things you would never want to do
01:14:31 -  so sobering word children you need it lest you think that serving God
01:14:37 -  is some kind of glib business which you perform by your strength, your wit, your ability, your personality
01:14:43 -  watch out he's holy and he's intent
01:14:49 -  upon bringing upon this earth at the end of the age his glory and two kinds of fire are going to fall
01:14:55 -  it's a kind of glory and a fire of judgment upon those who do what God has not commanded
01:15:01 -  holy, holy, holy holy is the Lord of Hope bow your head will you
01:15:11 -  precious God precious God, mighty Lord we ask you in Jesus name that if you are the same
01:15:19 -  God that commanded Moses these things if you have changed not
01:15:27 -  and are still as holy if you still see by the same eye and require the same kind
01:15:33 -  of awesome obedience if true ministry and service is still as bloody
01:15:39 -  and as sacrificial now as it was then if the day of consecration is the day
01:15:45 -  when we're willing to go in and out of the camp and slay every man, his own neighbor and friend and son
01:15:51 -  and maybe that compromiser of his own heart who rises up early
01:15:57 -  who rises up early to play Lord will you speak and seal this in the hearts of these people
01:16:05 -  to whom you've had me to speak these words will you save us together Lord from anything less
01:16:11 -  than holy priestly service will you remind us again and again the awesome responsibility
01:16:17 -  to serve God and never let us confuse it by looking at men and serving them
01:16:23 -  may it be acceptable sacrifice may it be acceptable sacrifice unto God always and will your tonight precious God
01:16:29 -  receive a royal priesthood men who are willing to put the sword in their sides
01:16:35 -  once and for all even if it means the cutting of their own flesh being left for dead
01:16:43 -  that one who frolics dances around golden calves and rises up early to play
01:16:51 -  in the name of Jesus understanding what true service is
01:16:57 -  willing to suffer the obedience of it
01:17:03 -  that you might in time be the instrument of the bringing forth of his glory
01:17:11 -  nothing that you shall delight in exhausted, bloodstained dripping down to your elbows and gore
01:17:17 -  will you raise your hand before God keep your right arm your right arm
01:17:23 -  Lord I want to be a priest of God no phony baloney
01:17:29 -  no posturing no affectation and I'm willing to be stripped ruthlessly
01:17:35 -  right to the core I'm not just laying hands on a ram or an ox I'm asking you to lay hands on me
01:17:43 -  and make of me a living sacrifice Lord let the blood flow
01:17:49 -  hack that flesh and I myself will wave it before you in gratitude
01:17:55 -  that you've separated me from anything that would bring any lesser service than what the true priesthood has ever brought
01:18:01 -  tonight I volunteer, I sign off Lord it's not an easy three month school but I want to be an instrument of your glory
01:18:09 -  I want to be a faithful servant and render holy priesthood service
01:18:18 -  to God for his glory by Christ Jesus precious God see every hand
01:18:24 -  and seal it bring them to their place of sacrifice Lord and teach them the lessons of waiting
01:18:36 -  in the holy place seven days to which I'll please you to bring them forth for a ministry of resurrection
01:18:44 -  in the eighth day pure holy ministry unto God thank you Lord
01:18:52 -  hallelujah be it so hallelujah
01:18:58 -  praise the Lord I don't know how to conclude children I don't know how to
01:19:04 -  send you home happy and say well it's just a message let's be friends
01:19:10 -  bless God let's all stand together
