The Fullness of the Gentiles 2 of 2

00:00 -  I have two things with me written by other men who have tentatively explored the word Zion, both remarkable men. And if you've heard of T. Austin Sparks, how many people have heard that name?
00:15 -  Remarkable commentator. I don't know when he gave this address, but you can almost feel him palpitating in between his statements.
00:24 -  He's gasping. He's drawing breath. He doesn't know what the next line is, as I don't.
00:30 -  And he's feeling for something, trying to apprehend something of a crucial critical kind and that's our task tonight. Okay Lord, precious God, this people are being treated or exposed to a number of things and
00:50 -  and not the least of which is the phenomenon of prophetic proclamation itself. Awkward, choked, weak, inept, feeling one's way through and it's important that they perceive this as you require me to demonstrate it, which is not comfortable, because they themselves
01:15 -  are called corporately to be a prophetic entity in the community where they are. And so whatever it is that constitutes the prophet in himself is also the essential constitution of the body called to be prophetic.
01:33 -  And it's good for them to catch a glimpse of the raw thing made manifest before them. So come Lord, because how are mysteries to be proclaimed and apprehended except through choked splurts and inchoate gropings and feelings our way.
01:52 -  For if it were a mechanical matter, it would no longer be a mystery. And as I mentioned over the dinner table, we Americans are especially inured, I-N-U-R-E-D. We are incapacitated against mystery.
02:08 -  We're too matter of fact, we're too mechanical, we're too, what's the word? We don't have a mentality, we don't have a disposition that lends itself to a respect for and a sensitivity toward mystery.
02:24 -  And yet the deepest things of God are encapsulated in mystery and that you gave to our brother Paul the stewardship of these mysteries that are now on time for their disclosure, not that we should become clever and hold forth impressively about them, but fulfill them.
02:47 -  So come Lord in your great mercy and make the mystery known. We thank and give you praise for the privilege in which we're required to participate with And in drawing out your heart and feeling our way through and apprehending, my God,
03:06 -  what is inherent in that mystery, which if we fail, we lose the game. We cannot be the church, we cannot be to Israel what we ought. The issue of your glory is left suspended and unfulfilled.
03:20 -  So we're asking mercy, Lord. And we thank you because we're going to be called to extend mercy and how shall we extend what we have not first perceived.
03:31 -  So let tonight be an exercise in the mercy of God for me, for them, for us together. We thank and give you praise in Jesus name, God's people said, amen. Let's go back to our text in Romans 11, one of the epical chapters of all scripture, where
03:54 -  the steward of the mystery, the apostle Paul takes the liberty of conflating a scripture out of Isaiah and a scripture out of Psalms to put it together in a new amalgam, a new in order to communicate a new thought of a kind that God has given him to express for
04:14 -  the church of every generation. Did you catch that? What a liberty the apostle takes to conflate and put together in a new expression one scripture
04:25 -  out of Isaiah and another out of Psalms and put the two together and make one new scripture out of it, a statement with a kind of apostolic liberty that I don't think offended the Lord. And that's the verse that we're looking at, 25 and 26, I would not brethren that you should
04:45 -  be ignorant of this mystery. You may be ignorant of others, but you'll not suffer the consequence that you will if you're ignorant of this one, which will be that you'll be made wise in your own conceit.
04:58 -  You'll be given to an arrogance. You'll become, what's the word, inflated if you miss this because this mystery is calculated for your humility.
05:11 -  There's something about the mystery of our relationship with the Jew and Israel that has by its very nature the power to temper us and to subdue us in our arrogance and to a dimension of humility to the church, which if it lacks, it loses its character as the
05:31 -  church. Nothing else will provide this. Something like we who are so bumptious and presumptuous to think that we are the first
05:41 -  and foremost consideration of God and that Israel may be a second consideration have to learn that our function in being established as the church is to play second fiddle to their restoration, that we are called to be the axis, the provision by which they come
06:04 -  into their fulfillment as if we are secondary and they are the foremost consideration. They will occupy a place eternally by that grace that has denied us. If that's not calculated to keep you down, keep you in a proper place in your own understanding
06:23 -  of the church, I don't know what is. So that's part of the mystery, that the relationship that God intends for us with them by its very nature is given to keep us in a place of subjection and humility appropriate to our character
06:39 -  as the church. If we do not receive the mystery and understand it in that way, we lose that very provision and automatically become bumptious, arrogant and conceited why we even think that we are
06:53 -  the kingdom of God and if not we will bring it in single-handedly. We'll do it through changing the economy and the social system and education and then we'll present it to the Lord as a finished fact.
07:06 -  We don't have to wait for the king to establish his kingdom, we'll do it. I'm not coining little notions. These are current thoughts in many segments of the church today and invariably when you
07:21 -  examine those segments you find that they are non-compassmentist on the issue of Israel. They have no regard, no understanding or they may talk about, let's pray for the peace of Jerusalem and give it a 60-second acknowledgement or they want to see the establishment of
07:37 -  the state as if they're doing God's service but they don't understand at all the magnitude of what is in here in the subject of Israel's restoration and in fact don't even expect that.
07:50 -  They would be content with just the success of a political state not knowing that the political state is given not to succeed but to die. They have not understood that there's a necessary suffering and a death before a resurrection
08:07 -  and an ascension and that Jesus himself who is the patterned son and the sum and substance of the genius of what Israel itself is, is indicating the path by which the people itself must come into their glory.
08:26 -  There's no ascension before there's a going down and God will give something in order to bring it down in the humanity of Jesus. Was there anything ever more perfect and when that humanity hung on the cross and the dejected
08:41 -  disciples on the road to Emmaus were crestfallen and crunched because they had thought it was he who would have restored the glory to Israel but alas, there he is, a dead cadaver on the cross contorted and so misshapen and brutalized that you can't even recognize this once beautiful
09:00 -  humanity, Jesus had to say to them, oh fools and slow of heart, not to believe all that the prophets have written, ought not the Messiah to suffer and die before he ascends to his glory?
09:15 -  If you were here now, he would say, fools and slow of heart, not to understand that the state, the nation must first suffer and die before it ascends to its glory? The problem is that you were thinking only in terms of political success.
09:31 -  You had no understanding of the intention of God for the people of Israel that has to do with his glory, that they are going to be the center of God's theocratic rule, that the law of God will fall out of their Zion and the word of the Lord out of their Jerusalem
09:48 -  and nations shall come with every feast of tabernacles to pay homage to the nation that God has restored and redeemed out of thousands of years of apostasy and given a place of preeminence before all nations, not because they have earned or obtained it by their merit,
10:07 -  but simply because he's God and as they were abated, now he will now allow them to abound. Why is that such, the reason that we don't comprehend it is that we ourselves not only have not experienced that, we do not desire to experience it.
10:26 -  We ourselves are content with religious success and have fallen short of any thought of God's glory, let alone that there should be a suffering that precedes it. So we project upon Israel the small measure of our own vision for ourselves upon them
10:43 -  and are offended if there's any greater intention of God that requires the centrality of the cross. Well, take my word for it and ponder what I'm saying. Okay, so what should we not be ignorant of? That blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the
11:08 -  Gentiles come in and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away unGodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins. What a remarkable statement that God is not
11:32 -  even waiting for Israel's repentance, but he will take transgression from them prior to any repentance and after he takes their transgression, after he restores them on the basis of his own mercy, then they will abhor themselves as we read in Ezekiel 36 for all
11:54 -  of the offenses which will then be revealed. Isn't a remarkable reversal of the way in which we understand and have received God's dealing with us, but with him, with them he has the special provision. He will take transgression from Jacob. He will act upon the nation. He
12:12 -  will not wait for it to deserve or to exercise itself in such a way as to obtain anything from God. It will simply be the recipient of a mercy that comes. Now why is this so critical a point? And the answer to that question requires a week's seminar, but just for the
12:33 -  purposes of shorthand, you need to understand that the issue of Israel is of a cosmic kind. Israel represents man, man in his self-sufficiency, man in his initiative, man in his own correctness, man in his own righteousness which God cannot allow to succeed because it is in error. There's
13:01 -  no good thing in man. There's no natural thing in man that God can reward. For what is man whose breath is in his nostrils? There's only one righteousness and that's God. There's only one mercy. That's God. There's only one love. That's God. That the issue of Israel
13:20 -  is not to demonstrate some special facility that they have. Look my no hands, we're Jewish that they would impress the goyim, the gentiles, but that they are the statement of what man is in himself and therefore they cannot even take credit for their repentance. When you
13:41 -  read Zechariah chapters 11, 12, 13, when the Lord comes, when all nations come against Jerusalem to destroy it, he comes with his feet on the Mount of Olives and destroy those armies that come to destroy Israel and in that day we should look upon him whom we have
13:57 -  pierced and mourn for him as one mourns for one's only son and be in bitterness for one's firstborn. Such a mourning it says that the family of David apart, the family of Nathan apart, this family apart, even husbands and wives apart, that the depth of the agony of
14:16 -  remorse that breaks upon Jewish consciousness in a moment in time when we see him whom we have pierced, whom we have blasphemed, whom we have rejected, whom we have violently rejected and scorned and dismissed as a sorcerer and a magician has actually come to be our deliverer
14:39 -  and the depth of that repentance exceeds anything that any of us have ever known or will know. It's a national repentance of a kind that heretofore has never taken place in the history of mankind. So deep a repentance that man cannot even bear to be in the same room with
14:56 -  another at the same time repenting before God. Husbands and wives apart, families apart in the depth of what happens in an historic moment but that has been seeded by millennia of Christ's rejection. I'm not doing this justice folks. So that's why you need to join
15:18 -  me. You need to come into this. You need to have your spirits engaged and draw out and understand what God is wanting to communicate. Of course it says there shall come out of Zion the deliverer. That's the whole subject that's before us tonight. What is the Zion
15:35 -  out of which deliverance comes? I think it proceeds or is synonymous with the coming of the Lord because this salvation that comes to the nation, some will be in Jerusalem and where the Lord's feet come on the Mount of Olives and they see him as deliverer but we're
15:53 -  talking about a migration of Jews. Maybe the greater number of Jews who have been uprooted from nations will be in passage through nations and will be encountering something because it says that the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion with mourning and sighing,
16:10 -  fleeing away and everlasting joy upon their heads indicates that some come as the result of this migration and sifting through the nation as restored and arriving as the redeemed of the Lord. Something happens to them in the course of this exodus that exceeds and
16:30 -  eclipses the initial exodus because it says in Jeremiah, you shall not remember me as the God who brought you out of Egypt but you'll remember me as the God who brought you out of all nations wherein I have scattered you. So there's an exodus yet future that exceeds
16:49 -  the exodus out of Egypt which till now has been the primary historic fact of Israel's identity as a nation and so why is it greater? Because the magnitude of it and the number of nations to which Jews will be brought but that the redeemed of the Lord will return
17:07 -  to Zion has redeemed and maybe that remnant that was in Jerusalem because there'll be an expulsion but there's always a residue that remains maybe the ones that look upon him whom we have seen although every eye shall see him and I don't have an answer for that
17:25 -  how all of that can take place and in what order but for our concern tonight we want to examine what does he mean when he says that there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away unGodliness from Jacob and why it is that Israel must be acted upon
17:45 -  and cannot be allowed itself to affect its own redemption or its own return because there's a cosmic issue that God is demonstrating before all nations that man is not the foremost consideration. What did the in the Renaissance the humanist man is the measure of all things you guys
18:06 -  remember that college from college 1A? Man is the measure of all things and God is saying no God is the measure of all things and I'm showing you that by using a nation who are the epitome of man. What is the distinction of a Jew? He is man epitomized he's man in
18:25 -  his greatest ability man in his greatest self-sufficiency man in his greatest self-confidence and that has got to fail and fail before the face of all nations so that all nations will be instructed by the example of Israel as a nation that could not succeed on the basis of its own
18:46 -  merit though they took a brilliant stab at it in resuscitating a dead language and revamping a swamp land the malarial wasteland and in half a century establishing a brilliant modern civilization with atomic and nuclear possibilities in the greatest air force that by any every
19:06 -  measure it would be the admiration of all nations and the ultimate success of man in his own sufficiency which is why it must fail and will fail and the Lord has seen to it the exacerbating condition of Palestinians in the land vying for their place in it having
19:28 -  had residence for centuries and locked in conflict with Zionists who are using biblical grounds as a claim in which though not believing in the biblical grounds employing it as a justification for the possession of the land there's a conflict in which God himself is
19:47 -  the author there's a conflict over which our sin as a people has been the preparation and that drama is being played out right before us in these days and is already affecting all the world though it's in a little corner of the earth called the Middle East all nations
20:06 -  are affected by this drama and this conflict and it will erupt it will fail it cannot succeed on the basis of the rejection of God and the celebration of man in his own wisdom so there needs to be a deliverer but what does it mean that the deliverer shall come out of Zion
20:31 -  and turn away unGodliness from Jacob or take transgression from Jacob and it's my supposition that Zion is a mystery word that refers to the church that connects with the verse above it that when the fullness of the Gentiles become in so all Israel shall be saved as
20:50 -  it is written that the issue of Israel's salvation is not the issue of Israel but the fullness of the Gentiles being come in something has got to take place that affects God's stratagem toward the nation but it's not because of anything that the nation itself does in Ezekiel
21:13 -  37 the valley of dry bones the nation is dead and they themselves say we are cut off we are without hope we are as dry bones we're incapable of affecting our own deliverance our own restoration even remarkably that the national anthem of Israel is called the hope
21:32 -  hatikvah is the hope but there's nothing in the text of that national anthem that refers to a hope in God it's a hope in man it's a hope in state it's a hope in humanity in Jewishness but it's not a hope in God and therefore it's a melancholy refrain that
21:53 -  precedes their disaster God has got to be their deliverer but evidently he waits for certain things to release that deliverance that come from a mysterious source called Zion and it's connected with the fullness of the Gentiles and the fullness as I suggested
22:14 -  last night is not just a numeric quantity from among all nations a people for his name from among all nations but a fullness beyond number that has got to be the measure of a certain quality and that quality of the church come of age is what I believe God is referring
22:34 -  mysteriously to in the word Zion so let me read a little from Sparks in this series of addresses that he gave in which you can just feel the man gasping and trying to find his way through this difficult topic he says right at the beginning from the commencement of
22:57 -  redemption history from the Israel's first deliverance out of Egypt and there the concept of coming into a land of promise the issue of Zion is already at hand thou will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance the place of Lord for thou
23:16 -  hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary Lord which thy hands have established right at the beginning Zion is in view as the end the consummation of their journeys and their experiences during the next 40 years yes and many more Zion is on the horizon from the
23:31 -  beginning Zion is not the beginning Zion is the consummation of everything you know are you familiar with Psalm 2 that remarkable eschatological Psalm that mentions Zion in a remarkably significant way why do the heathen rage and the people imagine the vain thing
23:53 -  the kings do very set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us he that sits in the heavens shall laugh and the Lord shall have them in derision then
24:09 -  shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sword this pleasure saying yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee ask of me and I shall give
24:27 -  thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession the nexus of God's rule the consummation of God's whole redemption history is to seat a king upon the holy hill of Zion and that all nations will be affected by that
24:47 -  rule who give him the heathen as his inheritance when he has a son upon the throne of Zion Zion is God's termination the climax of the age it's both a place but it's also a condition it's a holy hill and God has chosen it to confound the wisdom of the world that thinks
25:11 -  that the locus of God's rule should be in a more prestigious elevation some great mountain peak some something like or the New York or Geneva or world headquarters God chooses a hill and calls it holy and he makes it the place of his sanctuary and his rest place
25:33 -  residence and the issue of his law shall go forth out of it or shall not go forth at all Zion in God's sight is especially dear and its gates to him are more precious than any other place and yet when you read scripture and reference to Zion it implies that not
25:54 -  only is it a place but it's a condition of an ultimate kind something that has come to a final pitch of perfection and of maturity that I believe is referred to in the scripture in Romans that the deliverance will come out of Zion is not so much his emergence from
26:12 -  a physical place as the release for him to come out of a church that has come of age maybe I can give you a clue and a hint of that in Psalm 102 where there's another reference made to Zion it's a remarkable Psalm another eschatological Psalm that refers to the end
26:36 -  of a yet future time that has not yet taken place in history but toward which we're tending in which it begins and we won't have the time to look at it but at your own leisure it sounds like a man speaking from a concentration camp it sounds like a man who is desolate and bereft
26:53 -  of hope who has been reduced whose days are consumed in verse 3 like smoke and my bones are burned as in a hearth my heart is smitten with it like grass so that I forget to eat my bread by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin this is about as
27:11 -  graphic a picture of the victims of the Nazi concentration camps as is to be given in scripture and yet in the context it's to be seen as a man speaking of a condition that is yet future but will very much be reminiscent of the concentration camps of the past and when I visited Auschwitz
27:31 -  in Poland and Birkenau which is like 3 kilometers away which is the modern death camp of extermination because Auschwitz was the original Polish army installation in which the Nazis began but was inadequate as a factory of extermination and a few kilometers away they built this
27:50 -  most modern place for the systematic annihilation of millions of people with train tracks going right up to the gas chambers and the whole remarkable thing barracks and we walked over these acres of Birkenau with a brother from my fellowship and we saw the foundations of
28:10 -  these barracks and there's one or two of them that remain you can see how crude a facility it was how lacking in hygiene why typhoid and disease was rampant and daily they carried out the corpses or worked them to death and there over a million victims were systematically
28:29 -  processed and turned up through smoke stacks and this brother was saying as we were looking at that you're suggesting that the holocaust that is to come will eclipse the Nazi time because Jesus said that there's a time of trouble coming such as the nation has never
28:49 -  known or will again know and if that time were not cut short no flesh would survive but for the elect's sake that time will be cut short and this is an answer to the question what are the signs of your coming and of the end of the age and in that answer he gives
29:04 -  a description of a time of Jacob's trouble drawing actually from Jeremiah and Daniel to give a picture of a last days calamity coming upon Israel that if it were not cut short there would be no Jewish survival at all and he says it's greater than any past
29:22 -  trouble so if the past trouble took six million lives what will this future trouble take if it must eclipse it and be greater and so this brother said to me if it took this kind of apparatus of a factory of extermination to remove six million Jews or millions like in
29:41 -  other places like this what will it take in a shorter period of time for we know that the time of Jacob's trouble is established as a three and a half year period from the time of an antichrist seeking to be worshipped in Jerusalem and the rejection of that nation
29:57 -  recognizing that they've made a covenant with death and with hell and that releases and initiates this time of Jacob's trouble what must we be required then if in a shorter period of time a greater number of deaths must take place it would mean that there would
30:12 -  have to be camps like this in places not just in Poland or Europe but throughout the world wherever there are concentrations of Jews I had not thought like that but this psalm and the way in which this psalmist is describing the plight of an inmate sounds very much like
30:30 -  that it ends with because of an indignation verse 10 and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down here's one way that we know that this is not a description of past calamities but one of the future because here the calamity is of such a kind that the
30:51 -  victim himself recognizes that God himself is the agent and that what we are suffering is in proportion to a judgment for our sin as wrath that acknowledgement has not yet come from the past Holocaust so it must be something that is yet future because of your
31:09 -  indignation and your wrath for you have lifted me up and cast me down it's an acknowledgement of God in judgment which is yet future in the nation's experience and confession and then he says my days are like a shadow that declined and I am withered like grass but
31:28 -  you O Lord shall then do it forever and your remembrance unto all generations so here's a man in the midst of remarkable affliction yet because of it he's come to an acknowledgement of God in a way that is yet future in the history of Israel's experience can you follow
31:45 -  what I'm saying and then he makes this remarkable statement having acknowledged that he passes away but God shall endure forever and his remembrance to all generations for thou shalt arise here's the language of resurrection and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor
32:03 -  her yea the set time is come what is he seeing that there will be now a deliverance for Israel what is it that for which God waits that when it comes he's released to be Israel's deliverer that the deliverer shall come out of Zion he will have mercy upon Zion for the time
32:23 -  to favor her yes the set time has come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory
32:38 -  listen dear saints are you with me this is tough sledding this is difficult proclamation this is digging out and trying to bring credibility and sense to a mystery that is tied in with all of these verses in the way in which the Lord remarkably gives a little clue here in
33:01 -  the statement there and we're required somehow to put together something and find its meaning so that here again there's something spoken that seems to reverberate in what Paul says in Romans 11 it may well be that Paul got his insight from this very Psalm that Zion
33:20 -  is the key for Israel's deliverance not Israel herself and that there's a set time for which God waits to be that deliverer and what is it that he sees now that he's now released to be because his servants have favor upon her stones and mercy upon her dust what kind
33:38 -  of a statement is that that this epical turning of God to be the deliverer of his apostate nation after centuries of backsliddenness and alienation from God waits for something of this kind that his servants whoever they are it evidently is not Israel itself and
33:58 -  that they display something in having favor upon the stones of Israel and upon her dust that is so significant in God's sight that he's now released to be the deliverer of the nation because something has taken place in Zion for which he waits and that's something
34:17 -  if you'll allow my prophetic interpretation is a coming to a place of compassion and identification with a stricken nation for which there is no natural explanation while all the world is indignant at Israel and rubbing their hands in glee at the misfortune that will have fallen
34:39 -  upon the nation because the stones and the dust are the statement of judgment that will have brought down Haifa and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and all of the cities of Israel they will be reduced to stubble and this is not the only text that indicates this ruin Ezekiel
34:56 -  36 talks about the return to Israel and that the first thing that is accomplished is the rebuilding of the cities that have been made waste and left desolate and I don't have time to spell all this out for you so there's a certain kind of witness that needs to take
35:13 -  place in a short time that I'm on to something here that you can pursue at your own leisure and find the scriptures that will indeed confirm the scenario that I'm trying to put before you the stones and the dust is a symbolic poetic statement of a nation reduced in judgment
35:32 -  through devastation if you visit Israel today that's why I say I don't know that there'll be other tours I don't know that making a trip to Israel will again be feasible I don't know when the bottom will fall out but I know this the bottom will fall out and the proud
35:49 -  trade towers of Tel Aviv the diamond towers and all of the places that Israel has established as if there's no tomorrow as if they can continue and expect a security of an unrelenting kind will one day be reduced to rubble but in that reduction while the world delights in what
36:11 -  has befallen Israel who will be blamed for every adversity that has come into the world an oil crisis a collapse of economies Israel can do this a conflict in Israel is sufficient to tip the whole scale of the world economy and the world balance and that's why it's
36:30 -  so pivotal a thing and that collapse is going to come and the nations who lack a spiritual understanding and have a bias against the Jewish people even under the best circumstances will now relish Israel's plight and rub their hands in glee you have it coming you deserved
36:50 -  it you were arrogant you refused to negotiate you wouldn't give up a piece of land for peace you build a big wall you aggravated the Palestinians you can just hear it coming it's being said now Sharon is being called Hitler and Zionism is being called Nazism and Israel is being
37:12 -  called a nation of apartheid and discrimination prejudice and violence because there's sufficient evidences being given in their conduct to support allegations of this kind in the unregenerate who don't understand that Israel must come down that there must be a failure there must
37:31 -  be calamity and out of its ashes will come a resurrection of a people of a new nation a new character priestly who will bless all the families of the earth including those families that are now their enemies oh lord help me with a little help lord
37:50 -  so what is this remarkable significance that the set time to favor Zion has come when his servants have mercy upon her dust and compassion for her stones is more than antiquity is more than a certain kind of respect for the ancient cities of Israel it's an identification with
38:15 -  Israel in her judgment as being one with them not deserving of their judgment but we who were saved out of sin while we were yet in our transgressions and in our iniquity can have a heart of compassion and mercy for the nation that will be saved out of their transgression
38:37 -  and iniquity even as we were this is so remarkable a phenomenon that if we read the concluding verses of this song carefully the nations themselves take note of this remarkable thing and it sets those nations in a new kind of attitude toward the God of Israel and toward
38:59 -  their own salvation because what they see is so beyond anything that could be naturally expected it is so supernatural a phenomenon that there should be a people on the earth who are called his servants you say well shouldn't that be Israel it should be but it's not
39:16 -  if they were his servants they wouldn't be under judgment so God is referring to another entity in the earth at the time of Israel's judgment and debacle its collapse whom he addresses and observes as servants and waits for something in them that is not to be naturally
39:36 -  expected namely an identification with a people in judgment rightly so for their sin and yet a compassion and a mercy for them in that very condition having compassion for their dust and mercy for their stones when he sees that the deliverer comes out of Zion why because
39:58 -  what he has waited for in the church has been obtained the church has come to a place beyond itself it has come to a transcendent place beyond its own disposition for being judgmental and condemnatory as we presently now are one with another in our fellowships we've come
40:22 -  to a place of christlikeness of the forgiveness of God we're suffused with his mercy we are not at all tempted to follow the world in its categorical denunciation of Israel something has happened we have come of age in such a way that we stand in relationship to the people
40:42 -  as the lord himself does and when we come to that place of being as the lord is in mercy and compassion he will have obtained a bride for the bridegroom adorned for the bridegroom for the bridegroom adorned for the bridegroom means fitted for him and having a character
41:04 -  and a personality appropriate to the bridegroom who himself is mercy and is compassion that's the Zion for which God waits and how do we obtain it dear saints if presently and secretly we are already now judgmental what's the word pharisaical severe in our appraisals of one
41:28 -  another and that our affection is based and predicated upon merit or admiration or some performance of something that we admire we're selective we're partial we're so far removed in the church for the condition for which God waits toward Israel and we will be fixed
41:48 -  in our present condition unless we see what God is after and take it to heart and open ourselves to the sanctifying work of God first in our relationships one with another that when Israel comes to her final disgrace we unlike any in the world are not offended and
42:07 -  we are identified with them and have compassion upon their dust and have mercy upon their milestones and i want to say that that transfiguring and sanctifying work can only take place in the church that is the church so long as we are seated and looking up to a platform
42:27 -  and have no or little opportunity to see one another in our own faces and see the shortcomings and disparities of our own life and failure and weakness and come to a place of compassionate acceptance of one another in that weakness will never come to be toward Israel what God
42:46 -  waits for in zion that's why the issue of the church is the issue of Israel that's why he waits that's why Israel's redemption must come out of zion and out of no other place we are the issue of Israel's redemption in the fullness for which God waits in the gentiles
43:05 -  to come in is more than number it's a quality of life and being that cannot be obtained in mere sunday services that requires community the intensity of life together the dealings with God the siftings the kinds of suffering that is unique and is to be found only in
43:23 -  the intensity of life in the church as community that requires more than a succession of services that's a suffering and we will not have a stomach for it and we will shun it and look upon it with suspicion and be content with a predictable sunday christianity unless we
43:42 -  understand that the issue of Israel's redemption is more than the establishment of a nation's state that the issue of Israel's redemption is the issue of God's glory forever for the king must dwell in zion one of the reasons i don't want to go to Israel i'm pained to
44:00 -  see Israel in her present condition i don't want to see those flophouses and and prostitution rings and and jewish kids with nose rings and belly rings and tattoos and every kind of thing that's disgraceful especially for a jew to bear this is not a city fit for the
44:18 -  habitation of the king and yet he has made zion his intention as sanctuary and as dwelling and the locus of Israel something of the deepest redemption must take place there must be a judgment to burn up and consume in jerusalem all those things that are vile and are steeped
44:35 -  in blood and violence and we ourselves must not be repelled or alienated from that people as they suffer the judgments of God and their conduct every day betrays the need of that judgment and seems to confirm the criticisms that come against it from former allies all
44:56 -  around the world where there were seventy seven percent of the dutch nation believes that Israel is the is the nation most responsible most dangerous to the to the well-being of the world the land of and frank that once was so sympathetic has overnight shifted in
45:14 -  its whole allegiance and attitude about Israel and the remarkable thing is that it spills out beyond Israel beyond zionism and onto the jew himself that the jew then becomes the object of contempt and the anti-semitism that spreads the world which is why jacob's
45:33 -  trouble will affect jacob wherever he is whether in the land or outside of it that's why Paul ends his remarkable dissertation oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God who has been his counselor where did he get this who made the suggestion that there should be this
45:52 -  reciprocal relationship between Israel and the church where the one without the other cannot come into the fullness of God's intention how did he get that that was a divine stroke because these are the two entities that repel each other the jews have little respect for the church as an
46:11 -  object of contempt christianity to them is the very reason for anti-semitism in the references in the new testament scriptures to the jews and the crucifixion of Jesus and the jews let his blood be upon our heads and upon our children that's why they're they don't want to see this new film
46:30 -  by gibson on the passion because it will incite a fresh wave of anti-jewish reaction because jews are incriminated in the new testament account of the death of Jesus they refuse barabbas give us they refuse Jesus give us barabbas and now a whole generation is going to see that enacted in in such
46:50 -  a vividness as can inflame gentile hearts against jews but break the hearts of believers in the scene of the very same film jews historically have every reason to despise the church i have been in cities in germany where jews have committed wholesale suicide where they were locked
47:12 -  up in the synagogue synagogues as the knights were coming through en route to the holy land to pillage and loot the jewish communities to finance their coming into the holy land and gave jews the ultimatum be baptized or perish and jews chose to to to perish
47:32 -  they men would split the throats of their own children and their wives and kill one another that when the doors burst down of the jewish communities enclosed in their own synagogues they found the bodies heaped up and not one survival and that's called kadush hasham that's
47:50 -  sanctifying the name of God rather than falling into the hands of quote christians and be forcibly converted to have an alien religion by which they forsake their heritage and their jewishness can you understand that centuries of that so that even when it has passed historically the residue
48:09 -  is in the air we we jews have taken it in with our mother's milk there i had to be delivered together with other jewish believers of an anti-gentile bias that i didn't even know i possessed that was in my deeps being brought up in such an environment the lord gave us a time
48:29 -  together where we recognized we had to be delivered so what about jews who are not saved and see themselves as victims again at christian hands the last place the place that they will expect compassion and mercy is the church and it's the only place where they will find it
48:48 -  but it's not going to be some slobbery sentimental compassion which will go up like a puff when they disappoint us i know all those christian zionists who thinks that think that jews are cute and Israelis are cute and want to pinch out cheeks
49:04 -  but what happens when we're no longer cute what happens when we're disappointing what happens when the allegations against us are more true than false that we are violent that we do torture prisoners in order to extract from them confessions that will save us from another bus bombing
49:21 -  and various other injustices and violences that we would never have thought jews could be capable but because of the desperation of our condition we're forced through actions that contradict what we ever hoped the state of Israel to be
49:38 -  and so a lot of the sentimental affinity for Israel and the jew will go up like a puff when when they will be increasingly disappointed and when the state itself will collapse and jews will again be expelled and become the off scouring of the world and have no beauty that any should
49:56 -  desire them how many of those christian zionists who run now to the feast of tabernacles or to plant a tree will retain that kind of shallow and sentimental identification and loyalty the likelihood is that their shallow sentimentality will turn to hatred who then will favor zion
50:16 -  who then will have compassion upon Israel's stones in judgment and upon her dust but a people whom God calls my servants it'll be the making of you and the salvation of them and that's the mystery and when the world sees it so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of
50:38 -  the earth thy glory when the lord shall build of zion he shall appear in his glory he will appear in his people for they will reflect embody and demonstrate what he is in himself for he is mercy and he is compassion and though he's required to bring wrath and bring judgment it is in mercy
50:58 -  it is in mercy and mercy triumphs over judgment this is the great love of God that is unconditional and does not require from the jew a a an acceptable what do you call it track record it's in our failure it's in our apostasy in our judgment that his mercy is
51:23 -  most exemplified and shown but how is he glorified when he has a people on the earth whose attitude and spirit is exactly as his own because for them to live is christ they had gone from mere creedal affinity and doctrinal correctness into an assimilation
51:45 -  and a union with the very nature of the lord himself and the test of it is their response to Israel in her fallenness and when he sees that he can now turn to Israel for what he has wanted now in the church as a bride for the bridegroom has been obtained and it has been obtained in one
52:03 -  place only in the church's relationship to Israel this cannot be obtained except in the context of God's intention the radical sanctifying relationship with a yet apostate Israel which makes every ultimate demand upon the church the church in its corporality the
52:23 -  church in its corporateness not individual virtuosos the church in its totality it compels it to an apostolic identity on resurrection ground it's the issue of Israel that compels the church to be the church it's the issue of Israel that compels us to to welcome
52:44 -  the sanctifying work of God that will be demonstrated in that day when the set time to favor zion has come we will not submit ourselves to the dealings of God and the suffering that takes place uniquely in the church when it is lived as community i can tell you read my book
53:04 -  on the true fellowship and of all my 40 years in the lord the worst anguishes that i have ever experienced and are even current now is what i have experienced in the body in the community and not from the world when he will have finished the internal persecution that we are to each other
53:23 -  then we can expect they will come to us from outside ourselves but if you're not experiencing the suffering in the church you might well question to what degree is the church the church or just a harmless and predictable fellowship of a pleasant hail fellow well-met slap on the back
53:42 -  affinity by like-minded people because you have not lived together intensely enough and long enough to get at the root and ground of those things that are yet resident that need to be identified and met and can only be so dealt with in the intensity of relationship called community
54:01 -  it's a suffering saints before it's a glory and i'm saying we will not be willing for it we will not have a stomach for it unless we understand that the ultimate end of it is the glory of God forever all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God who's been his
54:17 -  counselor who has given to him it shall be given again for of him not art cats of him not even of him but through him not through our well-meaning charismatic evangelical intention that will fail as much as the failure of Israel on its the basis of its virtue to succeed there is something
54:40 -  required of God ultimately it's of him and it's through him it's by his power the issue of church is a resurrection phenomenon the ability to love one another and our differences that are so galling and frustrating and difficult is beyond our nice guy ism it's the life of God that brings us again
55:02 -  and again to his communion table where it's more than holding a little antiseptic crystal plastic cup and a little wafer and taking it as signal together we come to that table thirsting and hungering for the righteousness of God the mercy of God the patience of God
55:20 -  the kindness of God for however much we were nice guys before community two weeks into it reveal the paucity the inadequacy to continue as nice guys we need him and the great sacrament of his body and blood is not a little monthly or once a year triviality it's the most profound provision
55:43 -  of God for covenant keeping for the reality of God for the power of God and not only the power of his life but the nature of his life as much as we will eat and drink of him in truth in communion together if it's not communion and we're just strangers holding the cup you might as well dump
56:02 -  it it affects nothing it is only validated when we eat and drink together in communion who have faced each other and come to the most terrible revelation of the condition of one another the truth of what we in fact are and the most humiliating is the revelation of what we ourselves
56:23 -  are then we come to the table and say lord for us to live as christ i can't be to my brother what i ought how shall i be to the jew because when they come they're going to come they'll be terribly out of sorts they'll be banged up they'll be suddenly uprooted they'll they'll be in the worst
56:42 -  frame they'll they'll be mean-spirited they'll not be grateful they'll not be thankful for for the extending of ourselves in mercy to them they'll be critical they'll find fault with this that ever and will be blamed for their catastrophe and if there's anything in us that that wants to
56:59 -  draw itself up to its full dignity and say well if that's the way you're going to be then tough on you we will have missed the historic moment that will not be given again because we're told in in in ezekiel chapter 20 God speaking to his kinsmen i will meet with you in the wilderness
57:14 -  of the nations face to face and there you will come into the covenant the rod of my authority and into the provision of my covenant when i will meet with you in the wilderness of face to face you're going to see me not as you thought i was but as i in fact am and the face that you're going
57:34 -  to see is going to be black white yellow indians and in mexican villages in the sierra madre mountains and black believers in africa and all of the variety of my saints that i will move you through nations in a three and a half year period of time not just one nation but a series and you
57:56 -  will see the consistency of my people in every place who love you despite your mean-spiritedness and cannot be offended at your insult and your lack of gratitude because their love for you is not predicated on your performance but as unconditional as the love of God by nature is
58:16 -  listen saints however poor presentation this is and it lacks much this much we have to say the lord has said enough to show that there's a mystery of our relationship with Israel that is unavoidable and is intended in his divine wisdom not only for their redemption
58:38 -  but for our transfiguration because when that nation will be redeemed in the earth the law will go forth out of zion and God will have a nation in the earth to promulgate his kingdom and to welcome those nations that will come to commemorate their God and pay homage to the people
58:55 -  whom he has restored but in the heavens there will be an angelic entity who are ruling and reigning with christ some over five cities and some over 10 in wisdom and purity and compassion in things that they have learned in this earth that have fitted them for their own
59:16 -  eternal destiny and the final finishing school to have fitted us for that is our relationship with the jew who is the enemy of the gospel for our sake all the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God
59:39 -  so let me read my little footnote again this cannot be obtained except in the context of God's intention you can stand on your head you can talk about the prosperity message or anything other it will not provide the depth
59:59 -  of the sanctifying work that can only come in this given divine context our relationship with this difficult intransigent stiff-necked and apostate people oh i know my people well you dear saints you don't know them you're still too romantic you think that what you read in the
01:00:19 -  in the bible is is is relative to today's jew you'll be shocked when you go to Israel and find how other they are someone has said that the present day Israeli is a gentile people who have learned to speak hebrew they show no semblance of a jewishness that other jews can recognize
01:00:41 -  they have become other in the hard conditions of their life and the preservation of their nation under great adversity and threat even if today priest was declared they have already crossed a point of no return that they can never be the nation that they thought they would show
01:01:00 -  to the world they are as coarse as violent as immoral as corrupt as any nation perhaps more so because we pay double for our sins when we go into occultism we pay double for our sins we are twice disfigured and twice as dangerous in that condition and yet God will have mercy upon
01:01:25 -  whom he will have mercy that Israel serves the purposes of God not in their success but in their failure because it gives him opportunity to reveal his mercy where it is totally undeserved can you extend mercy where it is totally undeserved is the issue for he will be bound up and contained
01:01:46 -  in the heavens and will not be there deliver until he can come out of your zion it's not enough to be charismatic pentacostal evangelical we must become the zion of God and that will be costly a sacrifice and it begins now into consciousness of our call for the lord loves the gates of zion more than
01:02:10 -  the dwellings of jacob glorious things are spoken of you oh city of God and of zion it will be said this one and that one were born in her and the most high himself shall establish her not your well-meaning intention not not your christian virtue the lord
01:02:28 -  high himself will perfect and establish and glorify himself in zion in juda God is known his name is great in Israel in salem also his tabernacle his dwelling place in zion what is this zion they go from strength to strength any one of them and they appear before God in zion zion is a place
01:02:47 -  set apart for the high worship of God that i may tell of all your praise the gates of the daughters of zion i will rejoice in your salvation the singers and players on instruments say all my springs renew zion is the place of his anointing his provision the lord has chosen zion he's
01:03:02 -  desired for his habitation this is my resting place forever here i will dwell i have desired it i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor with bread that's what i learned in africa those that are poor are rich in faith
01:03:17 -  and we are poor and if we weren't poor before tonight we're poor now you know why because we're catching a glimpse of what is our mandate and our call and if we thought that we had the wherewithal to succeed for the lord in this life you know we're
01:03:31 -  realizing now in terms of the magnitude of what you're requiring of us as your zion for which you wait we are poor but he'll give us bread and strengthen us in our weakness for the lord shall build up zion when he builds up zion he shall appear in his glory the issue of zion is the
01:03:53 -  issuer's glory and for the want of this realization this identity our church is lackluster our church is beneath the intention of God we're living beneath the glory of God for we have not seen the mystery and identified with it and taken it to ourselves and let i make clear to the lord
01:04:15 -  we're willing to be to come to the place by which your glory shall be demonstrated and Israel restored and a bride obtained for the bridegroom and we're willing for whatever it is required to obtain it we're beneath the intention of God and we measure by another index our
01:04:36 -  enjoyment of the services that you like to speak or enjoy the fellowship all of that is good but it's a culture and not yet a glory and it will not be a glory until it sees the ultimate intention of God for zion is ultimacy a church brought to ultimacy for ultimate purposes
01:04:56 -  nothing less than the redemption of a nation millennia long in their apostasy and whose restoration is the release of the king to dwell in their zion and out of whose zion the lord shall go forth to all nations who will study war no more move toward authentic community which is not
01:05:17 -  an option to church it is church our present configuration that we call church is so below and beneath the apostolic model that was given at the first and to which we need to return if we are the zion out of which the deliverer will come
