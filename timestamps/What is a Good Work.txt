What is a Good Work

00:00 -  and to your Saints precious God lead us exquisitely by your spirit and word for word from heaven give us a divine communication that shall be recorded in the annals of God as historic for the Church of Jesus Christ in New Zealand
00:20 -  and for the earth let it be an hour in which a time has come and a word is to be born my God give us a word of release something utterly consequential we wait upon thee Lord we thank thee for such an hour give us hearing ears and an
00:47 -  understanding heart and an obedient will let there be a consequence for this night my God that shall send shock word waves reverberations throughout a nation and beyond the nation Lord we're asking largely for we know that you can answer
01:07 -  and we ask that you will not for our sakes for that dying world sake for your name sake do it we pray we'll give you the honor the praise the glory the acknowledgement the tribute in Jesus holy name amen well I feel this is one of
01:28 -  those occasions where I'm being required to walk over that precipice with the balancing pole and over the tight wire over a chasm that I have never before traversed but I'm willing to take the chance of plunging as a matter of fact I
01:46 -  have no alternative I've tried to shake it off it avails nothing I have simply just to go ahead and see how it's going to work up we can begin with Matthew 5 and I ask you to listen attentively taking these steps with me sermon on
02:12 -  the portion that we referred to at the beginning from the verse 10 blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say
02:27 -  all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of me rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great for so they persecuted the prophets who would be for you you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has become tasteless how
02:40 -  will it be made salty again it is good for nothing anymore except to be thrown out and trampled on the foot by men you are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hidden nor do men light a lamp and put it under the peck measure
02:55 -  but on the lamp stand and it gives light to all who are in the house let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven I made reference to last time on this
03:15 -  topic that there's a conjunction between righteousness and glory and the good works that are referred to in the 16th verse are the works of righteousness and these alone glorify our father who is in heaven it may seem seem like a simple
03:36 -  observation a truism hardly worth speaking but the only kinds of work that will glorify God or the father is God's own work the father's own work is the only kind that will glorify him every other work however well-meaning however
03:54 -  sincere is a dead work we need to be shaken profoundly to recognize that the measure for estimating whether a work is God's or man's is not whether it seems to succeed whether it brings numerical increase whether it makes the people
04:15 -  happy whether it seems to fulfill a conspicuous need all of those things may be true and it may yet be a dead work there's only one absolute standard by which a work will glorify God the father and that is that it's the work that he
04:33 -  himself has ordained and performs through us if that's the case if that alone is a good work a living work as compared to a dead work what work is it is it feeding refugees is it opposing atomic arsenals is it campaigning for
04:56 -  pacifism is it against smog and pollution of the earth is it in being involved in teachers strikes or against strikes what is the good work that will glorify our father who is in heaven and I want to give the cat is that the
05:24 -  expression let the cat out of the bag and say that the work in my opinion at the end time work that will glorify the father is the work that is born out of the rest of God and I hope to show that tonight in taking you through a bit of
05:45 -  an excursion in the scripture there's been a subject on my heart virtually from the time I've arrived that I've been trying to swallow down or ignore but the Lord has not allowed me to do so and tonight I have got to allude to it
05:57 -  if you'll turn to with me to Isaiah 55 I'll begin to introduce it or let's say Isaiah 56 that says the Lord preserve justice and do righteousness amen that's been his theme from the first with us in these days for my salvation is about to
06:22 -  come and my righteousness to be revealed I've underlined in my Bible the word my the works that glorify the father are also things that constitute his righteousness any other righteousness is self-righteousness as any other work is
06:40 -  dead work I hope to appear before you tonight as one utterly simplistic and absolute in his views black or white how blessed is the man who does this and no other and the son of man who takes hold of it who keeps from profaning my
07:05 -  Sabbath how did that get in there how do we all of a sudden go from works to Sabbath what is this some kind of sleight of hand some kind of death manipulation or is there some kind of profound connection between work and
07:21 -  rest a paradox an end-time final revelation of something that has evaded us that we need both to see and to apprehend in our experience who keeps from profaning the Sabbath and keeps his hand from doing any evil I'm gonna be
07:46 -  gasping and sucking air all the way through this so this is only sign number one and the reason I'm doing so is because I almost virtually have to start from scratch speak to you as if you have never understood or had the
08:03 -  faintest inkling and you're being introduced for the first time to some of the most fundamental and necessary concepts of God for example when you read the word evil there I'm sure immediately that you conjure up in your
08:15 -  mind some grimy picture of something lascivious and steeped in sensuality and vulgarity and orgies well yes that's one expression but there are subtleties of evil that don't have any of these connotations at all and yet in God's
08:33 -  sight are equally and as blatantly evil for which we ourselves everyone in this room are guilty what kind of evil are you talking about art if you're not talking about blatant sin or moral corruption well it's alluded to a little
08:54 -  earlier in the 55th chapter where we read in the seventh verse let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the Lord and he will have compassion on him and to our God for he will abundantly
09:09 -  pardon for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts we are so naive so
09:25 -  earthly so human in our considerations however religious that we have not understood the enormous gap the disparity between heaven and earth and our thoughts and his thoughts and our ways and his ways so much so that God
09:45 -  says let the wicked forsake his way doesn't mean that his way is apparently wicked or evil it doesn't mean that he's rolling in the gutter in his vomit it doesn't mean that he's debauched in sin it means that he is simply assuming
10:03 -  and enjoying and taking to himself a way which is his own and not God's that's enough in God's sight to make it wicked and it's equally as much in God's sight for our thoughts to make us unrighteous not because it has to do with
10:19 -  fornication or adultery or other kinds of sensual imaginings but only because it's our thought I'm hoping against hope I'm operating by faith that you're understanding that we need to see as God sees and how wicked and unrighteous we
10:42 -  have been before him initiating things out of ourselves programs and activities and every kind of religious conduct that had a seeming appearance of good but in God's sight was wicked or evil because it was our way not his it was our
11:04 -  thought and that's what made it unrighteous the thought was religious was even spiritual but the thing that makes it unrighteous is it was ours I sometimes feel like the one of the few servants of God in the earth who has this brooding
11:28 -  passionate jealousy for the complex working of God in the last days to see this labyrinthine interweaving of the purposes of God that so much as a hiccup in Moscow has reverberations in Washington DC and so is it also in the
11:48 -  kingdom if you but once glimpsed this and understand that we're moving toward the culmination of the age and everything is so intricately bound up you would not ascend the platform like this even to speak in two by four New
12:01 -  Zealand to a meager collection of Saints without the greatest kind of foreboding and trembling you say odd it's only us well that's the way you may see it but that's not the way God sees it God sees it and I choose to see this night tonight
12:16 -  as utterly historic as if time itself is suspended as if God is wanting to birth and bring into existence by his word an event that will have such consequence you say my you have grandiose notions but I always think so
12:40 -  and if it were not so I wouldn't want to be on platforms because I'm not an entertainer I always believe that God has such ultimate things to perform and I have an especial sense of that tonight
12:59 -  God calls us to do righteousness but not our own he calls us to do good works so that in that final wedding supper we shall not be embarrassingly and eternally naked but clothed with the garment that is made of the good works
13:19 -  of the Saints the good deeds the righteous deeds of the Saints constitute that garment how careful we ought to be about what would then we do what ought we to do what constitutes a good work blessed is the man who does this that
13:40 -  his God's righteousness might be revealed who keeps from profaning the Sabbath and keeps his hand from doing any evil let not the farno is joined himself to the Lord say the Lord will either surely separate me from his
13:54 -  people neither let the eunuch say behold I am a dry tree for thus says the Lord to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbath and choose what pleases me and hold fast my covenant to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and the
14:10 -  name better than that of sons and daughters and I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off also the fathers who join themselves for the Lord to minister to him and to love the name of the Lord to be his
14:21 -  servants everyone who keeps from profaning the Sabbath and holds fast my covenant even those I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable
14:34 -  on my altar strange passages wait what does have this have to do with righteousness and deeds this reference to Sabbath and the eunuchs who keep them I want to say that one of most radical requirements that God has ever posited
14:57 -  to his people has been to keep his Sabbath it's so radical a requirement so contrary to human inclination disposition and will that you virtually have to be a eunuch to do it and there's something growing in my spirit and
15:18 -  consciousness especially in these days with you through conversation and through my own observation a sense that you're wonderful hearers that you're most fastidious and taking notes from speakers that you nod acceptably and
15:35 -  sigh into all the appropriate places and a kind of spiritual amen but I'm not at all persuaded that you're going to do what you hear as a matter of fact I have a growing impression that you're chronic non-doers there's something
15:53 -  about doing that changes everything and somehow we have been so spoiled by nodding and being in agreement with things spiritual and agreeing to the things that are preached that it has even dulled and made it even more
16:07 -  difficult to be able to break out of that filmy cellophane plastic thing that contains us and keeps us from being the doers of God's Word now not too long ago God spoke into my own fellowship during a period of time that we were waiting
16:24 -  upon him for ten days an entire fellowship had called a moratorium on everything we took the phone off the hook in every way that we could literally symbolically we ceased every function and every act and we wanted to
16:45 -  come before God and wait upon him in a kind of complete cessation of ourselves we wanted to quiet ourselves before God you say how was this born well I have been preaching everywhere that the church was born in waiting that the one
17:05 -  commandment in which an obedience to which the church was born was wait in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from above that you may be witnesses unto me and the Lord has just been drilling this into my heart this utter
17:20 -  and profound waiting with the women also for ten days in an upper room it's a staggering thing I don't think that we have adequately considered it what that means because it is so alien to our own experience we had had an earlier time a
17:39 -  few years before in a crisis of our fellowship when Alan Williams with with was with us precious why we're in brother who led us through a great difficulty where the Lord had us on our faces for 13 hours in utter silence it
17:54 -  was not at all boring I have never had my spirit so profoundly engaged in God as through those 13 hours nothing happened at the conclusion of them but we knew when it was over and we all rose from our faces the adults of the
18:10 -  community who are each other's throats in such a tension and a poisoned atmosphere of suspicion and jealousy and every kind of thing that had gone wrong and gone amok so we had come into community with the bravest and noblest
18:25 -  of kingdom intentions we had come to a crisis beyond our ability to solve though we were artful in all of the vocabulary of a kingdom come we could not perform it we came to a place of utter desolation brokenness we had
18:43 -  confessed our sins to one another it had to begin with me we wept we prayed and we finally came to a place where we could say nothing more and do nothing more we came to an utter end we went down that morning by some kind of
18:56 -  unspoken signal on our faces before God as dead and the only thing that broke that silence that punctuated those 13 hours was an occasional groan or a sob not any talking I'll show you how carnal we are I'm sure that you're asking well
19:16 -  did the glory of God fall if you wait on God with a motive and an expectation that you're going to receive a reward for your investment it's no longer waiting on God it's a utilitarian investment which is already too much of
19:36 -  what we presently are waiting on God is not because you expect or you deserve or you need a response it's because God is God and we are men and this is the correct foundational posture before him and I don't think we're going anywhere
19:56 -  folks until we find it and I don't think we're going to undertake anything either until we find it because it's likely to be born out of our own feverish mind out of our own compulsive necessity to do out of our own insecurity that requires
20:13 -  some kind of activity that we might found be found to be doing something good for God I'm suspicious profoundly suspicious of our humanity something needs to come down in a totality before God where there's not so much as a
20:30 -  whimper possible out of us then if it shall please him he can unfold his strategy for a world that is so compacted in its bloodshed its violence and its corruption that no man has the wisdom to know how to unravel it or
20:46 -  where to begin don't ask me how this is to be reconciled with Lauren's points of view I'm not even asking the question I'm only obediently opening my mouth and speaking somehow I there's a way in which it's to be resolved waiting is
21:07 -  another name for Sabbath Sabbath is another name for waiting a total cessation from men a bringing to a quiet before God of the entire human personality and I'm not speaking about sinful corrupt men who have to be kept
21:26 -  from their sport and from their diversions I'm speaking about spiritual men who mean well for God who also need to come down before him in that kind of totality it was in the course of a let me get to this so having preached that
21:41 -  the church began in waiting in the command to wait I remember stepping off the pulpit one day flushed in my face having preached wonderfully and some young believer you can always trust them naive coming up and staying with
21:55 -  complete innocence and candor Artie said in all of your travels all over the world he said have you ever found a single fellowship that has yet waited together ten days on the Lord as they did before Pentecost know the kinds of
22:06 -  questions that when they've asked they hit you in the solar plexus and you gasp and double over the air goes out of you it was that kind of a question I was devastated by it and my mind raced through some of the most beautiful
22:19 -  fellowships to be found over the earth that I've had the privilege of touching and ministering at visiting and knowing and it finally had to turn to this young man and say no I don't know one that has ever yet waited in modern times ten days
22:32 -  on the Lord together and then the Lord asked his question how about your fellowship hot shot so I came home and I shared it with the folks and they all agreed yes one day we ought to do it but of course it will have to be a really
22:53 -  opportune day when the kids don't go off to school when the demands of the ministry and community are somehow at a minimum and that we can afford to do it in that day somehow the day never came somehow the demands grew more hectic more
23:07 -  demanding more voluminous more pressing until this past September we came to a resolution that such a day would never come the world of flesh and the devil let alone God's people would never grant it we simply had to take it we had to be
23:24 -  a doer of the word the kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force it cometh not by observation and so we declared as of Monday this fellowship is commencing a ten-day period of waiting on the Lord in fasting
23:43 -  for as many of those days as you can I think most of the men fasted the entire ten days and we didn't die felt like it and it's going to begin at such-and-such a building and we're going to begin every morning meeting together at eight
24:01 -  after the kids go off to school put away every practical task and every burning necessity we're not going to the office we're not going to open our mail or see to our correspondence we're giving ourselves totally holy exclusively to
24:13 -  God in waiting we didn't know how to do it but to begin we thought that we would stay up all the night the elders first and we fell asleep some were more persistent than others but it was a groggy and unsatisfying night and in the
24:30 -  morning the Lord showed us that he had another way that there was to be prayer 24 hours a day around the clock in three hour shifts and we had ten days of prayer 24 hours a day around the clock and found ourselves praying with saints
24:48 -  who are in the fellowship but we have never seen them in this posture or in this relationship somewhere between 3 and 6 a.m. in the morning on the seventh day of the fast groggy foul breath mind dulled to be in the same room with three
25:01 -  or four others in the same condition you want to know something I never heard such prayers I never heard such prayers somehow we had come beyond and into a dimension be other than that which we had prayed previously and our prayers
25:17 -  were not bad before they were conscientious and dutiful and sincere but this was another dimension of prayer almost beyond ourselves and not even of ourselves but we were too wasted by lack of sleep by lack of food by
25:31 -  tiredness by by the strange thing of being lost in God in that continual realm of waiting for it any more to be self-consciously our own I cannot believe some of the things that we prayed heroic devastating large radical
25:48 -  sweeping the ten days did not end with the falling of God's glory which I so desired that he would render heavens and come down and make the mountains to quake enough them in our presence but we had extraordinary dealings day after
26:06 -  day I have never seen such exquisite powerful penetrating dealings of God with men as was our privilege to experience morning after morning as we assemble together I can't take the time to describe some of them or any of them
26:21 -  I just want to say in summary that for me the greatest value was this a foundational thing was corrected or established for the first time in my understanding namely that God is the Creator and that we are the creatures
26:38 -  and that there's only one fit and right appropriate posture of ourselves before him and that is in total prostration and an utter silence waiting that's the priestly place and until that is restored we're not going to find the
26:56 -  apostolic place for these are inextricably connected for Jesus is the high priest and the Apostle of our confession this is an hour of restoration and God is restoring what has been lost to the church through
27:14 -  tradition through human manipulation through mere religious practice and waiting upon God is one of these foundational things that is now in process of being restored on the seventh day of the ten days of waiting it proved
27:32 -  to be a Sunday and in that service one of the elders gave a message on the Sabbath of God switch on the Sabbath of God I praise God that I was not the one who gave it lest anyone would think that I was speaking out of my
27:48 -  Jewishness that there was some kind of residue hangover of something intrinsic to my Jewish past that was now being subjectively expressed the word came out of the mouth of a Gentile of the Gentiles a man different from me in
28:04 -  every point and particular and when I heard that word a hush came over my spirit and I knew that we were hearing a Rhema of God a now word a word that we were privileged there was something being given that came down from heaven
28:20 -  it was perfect and it was from the text in Isaiah 58 the 13th verse if because of the Sabbath you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor it
28:44 -  desisting from your own ways and from seeking your own pleasure and speaking your own word then you will take a delight in the Lord and I will make you ride on the height heights of the earth and I will feed you with the heritage of
28:59 -  Jacob your father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken and underneath that text I have written Sunday September 13th 1981 Dominion evening service art BB's message perfect I wanted to remember this word that broke into time
29:19 -  that came out of the heart of God that was not given as Bible study it was not given as something to which we should nod for its aesthetic or spiritual appeal and beauty it was given to obey God was calling us to restore the Sabbath in
29:36 -  practice all I used to say to people who would ask me well art you're Jewish and you're a believer what about the Sabbath you observe it well no we're we're in grace and we're beyond the law and we're no longer required to have this kind of
29:53 -  observation for me every day is the Sabbath and yet as I said that though to a sense it was true and probably more true for me than for most because of a rest to which the Lord had been bringing me of necessity must bring me or else
30:06 -  how can you follow after the Lord for two and a half months at a time from Egypt to Israel to Athens come aboard a ship on our Easter Sunday without preparation and banged out of shape and no no time to prepare yourself and miss
30:20 -  the first launch and get there with the service begun and be rushed up to the platform and just have a presentiment in your spirit John 11 Lazarus and open the Bible and open your mouth and something comes out of such portent for
30:31 -  that people and so also in Belgrade which was the next stop and arrive in Belgrade in the same condition and have four services one right after the other and East Germany for a month in occasions that way church history in the
30:48 -  making that you held your breath as God led us through things so intricate with patriarchs and apostolic giants of the faith in a room listening to me and then on to ministers conferences in France and Switzerland and back to West Germany
31:05 -  and to England for two and a half months day in and day out night after night you've got to be in the rest of God it's if it's not even physically possible so I knew it in a measure but I was never happy with my glib aside of or every day
31:24 -  is the Sabbath when the fact of the matter is that no day in fact was I'm not pressing for a particular day but I'm suggesting that this shall always remain for us a kind of biblical rhetoric a near kind of fanciful
31:45 -  expression a sweet sound in the ear until we shall determine to do it I just want to share our beginning experience from the day that the Lord spoke this to us we sought to make our Sunday in to a day of the Lord not an hour of the
32:02 -  Lord not a few hours of service for the Lord the day of the Lord because the word says from doing your own pleasure on my holy day were we actually able to give God a full day in the week wouldn't we be bored what would we do before and
32:25 -  after the service what if it the weather was beautiful and you itched to be out rolling on the lawn supposing the kids were chasing and impatient as a great day for a ballgame could you say to them who have school five days a week and
32:41 -  Saturday chores that listen this is the Lord's Day and you cannot indulge your pleasure in sport oh come on art you can't be that cruel after all they're only kids it's wholesome recreation they need a bit of sport God doesn't mind you
33:00 -  see why only eunuchs can keep the Sabbath I want to tell you that one of my favorite heroes in the scripture is a eunuch and I have paid a price for celebrating him publicly an Ethiopian Ethiopian eunuch in the book of Acts
33:19 -  chapter 7 or 8 I think it is described as a man of great authority who had the charge of all the Queen's treasure only eunuchs can you say how come because something has been radically dealt with at the root that there's no way after
33:38 -  that that anything that belongs to the Treasury can be misappropriated by such a one in the house of God you can trust him with your bevy of wives with your what do you call it your harem you can trust him with your treasure you can
33:54 -  trust him because the axe has been laid to the root I thought a eunuch would be some high pittsqueak voice effeminate character but it says a man of great authority there's not many who would like so to have the axe laid so
34:16 -  radically to the root of their lives and for that reason they're not entrusted with treasure nor a great authority and I have been looking at that map every day that we have been here that map has been pressed into my eyeballs I
34:31 -  virtually see it steeped in blood and can hear the groans and cries coming out of every corner of the earth the needs are overwhelming for the righteous acts of the Saints but what is needed to perform them is great authority and the
34:49 -  charge of all of the King's treasure a eunuch is not only stripped of any prospect of misappropriation he has to bear also the stigma of being so denuded he's a radically separated man that's what the word radical means
35:11 -  right to the root a kind of a selflessness and single-eyed service to God that somehow cannot be rendered by others whose eyes always will somehow itch or be tempted to see something voluptuous for themselves but a man who
35:27 -  has been radically dealt with at the root has no reason for his eyes to wonder or to be distracted there's no possibility of insinuating his own ambition in the purposes of his King there's a single eyedness that is
35:41 -  possible only to a eunuch that is not available to others see others will talk about every day is the Sabbath but for them no one day ever is a eunuch is one who keeps it and takes hold of the Covenant and of God and keeps his
36:00 -  Sabbath keeps it I don't give a rat what the weather is like well how much the kids need recreation or what ballgame is on TV or what innocent or harmless diversion could be enjoyed he keeps it and makes it the Lord's day I can't tell
36:27 -  you how excruciating walking this out has been for us and we're heads and shoulders above you not because we're superior but because we've had seven years of a far more intensive and demanding kind of life and community than
36:42 -  ever you have known in your charismatic and other situations or can know but despite that seven-year investment when we had but to be obedient to this one word that came down from heaven on the seventh day symbolically enough of a ten
36:57 -  day time of utter separation to God and waiting it was excruciating what should we do at the time what about my kids and their restlessness what about my wife's dotting looks what about the hints of some that couldn't we do this and
37:13 -  couldn't we do that would that be considered pleasure how do you define pleasure and and begin to sense all of these subtle ways in which men extricate themselves from a total obedience to God it was a painful
37:30 -  walking out what God has said and we're not through it yet on the very second or third week I was in my room in a kind of rest up on the Lord before the evening service it was a beautiful day and I was kind of waken from my reverie by shouts
37:49 -  and screams and kids playing right outside my window my house is just a stone's throw right across a little path from the other eldest house who gave this message he was sitting by the window so he heard these shouts as
38:06 -  clearly as I I immediately rushed down to see what's up and the kids had just broken up they had been playing ball and so so long as I was up and out I walked into his house and I said the brother said did you hear that noise he said
38:20 -  what noise sometimes you'll not count this travesty it's almost more rich to quote Shakespeare than the Bible conscience does make cowards of us all you can give a brave word but if it's your kids who are playing ball and you
38:45 -  have to stop them and come out there and say hey didn't God speak to us about keeping the Sabbath and desisting from our own pleasure and doing our own thing and seeking our own way now I'm required to tell you kids that you have to cease
38:58 -  right now from playing how many of us can stand the look of their kids who construe us and see us as legalistic unfair or whatever other adjective they could come up with and have to look at their pained faces and see that we have
39:22 -  lost the steam in their sight because formerly they had seen us as nice guys and real elders and wonderfully balanced men who understand and now we are narrow and insistent what noise he said he went strangely and conveniently deaf
39:43 -  because he could not bring himself to the kind of obedience that would result in a loss of esteem with these kids it takes a eunuch to keep the Sabbaths of God for thus says the Lord to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths in actuality by
40:12 -  doing the word I don't care whether it's Sunday that you choose to do it or Saturday but I wonder what it would mean if Christians in a particular nation would determine to do it and give an entire day over to the Lord not so much
40:33 -  as turning on their TV set not so orchestrating their Sunday service that allows them to sleep in late from staying up late the night before before the TV set or the good pleasure and coming home yet sufficiently early to
40:45 -  have the full day the balance of the day for the pleasure but that they gave the Lord the whole day how long would it take before that would come to the attention of the Gentiles around you who would think you insane for so
40:58 -  misspending that valuable time I think it might be one of the most profound witnesses that we could ever practice to be the doers of such a word and to choose that which pleases him and hold fast the covenants word came to him
41:20 -  through the evangelist that was joined to his chariot he said what does hinder me seeing this water from being baptized nothing if you believe with all your heart and so it says and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they
41:38 -  went down into the water this is why a eunuch though is a eunuch though he is despised in the world is esteemed by God the world may laugh up its sleeve at these strange men who are single-eyed in their devotion to do it to stop the
41:59 -  chariot and get off and go down but the Lord loves them and he says that he'll give them a name in his house beyond that which is given better than that which is given to sons and daughters I will give them an everlasting name which
42:14 -  will not be cut off because they are cut off from their own pleasure and doing their own thing he'll give them a name which will not be cut off in Matthew 19 Jesus said there were eunuchs that are born eunuchs poor freaks they couldn't
42:32 -  help themselves and there were eunuchs that are made eunuchs of men I guess it must take about four able-bodied men to hold them down and lay the axe to their root and then he says there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the
42:49 -  kingdom of heaven's sake let them who can hear it hear it I don't think that these great needs in the world this great cry for righteousness the prophetic presence for a church in a world that is disintegrating is going to be met
43:09 -  except by those who take hold of the Sabbath of God because I don't think that anything that is born outside of that Sabbath is likely to be a good work maybe our work but it will not be his and it will not glorify the Father also
43:31 -  the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord to minister to him this is priestly ministry I can hardly imagine what or how know how to describe what such ministry is of a ministry that is a ministry to him that is not to men that
43:47 -  is not determined or affected by how the people will like it or how they'll receive it but is utterly and singularly given to him priestly ministry to be his servants everyone who keeps from profaning the Sabbath and holds fast my
44:05 -  covenant even those I'll bring to my holy mountain that's a reference to the government of God to the Zion of God to the law of God that goes forth out of that Zion for nations I'll bring to that holy mountain getting restless I am I
44:21 -  see a few you're shifting in your seats the word losing its novelty those I will bring to my holy mountain those who have charge of the King's treasure men of authority who will rule and reign with him who do not profane
44:48 -  the Sabbath but take hold because they're eunuchs who keep his Sabbath and make them joyful in my house of prayer so one is a reference to the church as it affects the world and the other is a reference to the church as it affects
45:05 -  the Saints to be effective and powerful in one and joyful in the other is the privilege that God gives to those that keep his Sabbaths and choose what pleases him few verses down there's a kind of an alternative that is suggested
45:25 -  from the 10th verse on in chapter 56 of Isaiah his watchmen are blind all of them know nothing all of them are dumb dogs unable to bark dream is lying down who love to slumber and the dogs are greedy they are not satisfied and they are
45:37 -  shepherds who have no understanding they have all turned to their own way each one to his unjust gain to the last one come they say let us drink get wine and let us drink heavily of strong drink and tomorrow will be like today only more so
45:52 -  in my kind of intensity tonight do I dare suggest that when the smoke clears in this radical centrifugal process that is going on by which we are moving toward one radical orbit or another and there's no neutral ground between that
46:10 -  the two things that are offered and toward which we're tending is one to be a eunuch who keeps the Sabbaths of God and does his pleasure whose ministry is unto the Lord who holds fast the Covenant who has a place in his holy
46:25 -  mountain and in his house as against others who are dumb dogs who bark we don't even bark who are toothless whose activity and sound signifies nothing who a dream is lying down who love to slumber who say amen and sigh for the
46:43 -  word but don't do a thing about it a spiritual slumber a lying down a life that is inconsequential meaningless both for time and for eternity they are shepherds it says who have no understanding greedy for their own gain
46:59 -  their own denomination their own work their own pleasure but that's all they have all turned to their own way each one to his unjust gain to the last one and tomorrow will be like today only more so Christianity which is a mere
47:17 -  succession of services boring monotonous predictable dull one Sunday like another a little faint variety perhaps in a visiting speaker but nothing substantially to be expected different from previous Sundays tomorrow will be
47:36 -  like today only more so excuse me for this whole simplistic view tonight and for radically suggesting that we're coming to an hour when it's the one or the other that we're going to be a people who are doers of the word no
47:50 -  matter how it makes us appear to men no matter how it's going to offend our kids no matter how we cannot explain ourselves because the Lord has said you shall keep my Sabbath you shall not profane it for if because of the Sabbath
48:04 -  you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight and not a drag not a boring requirement not a religious obligation a delight the Lord's day who knows to what degree the heaven will be
48:25 -  opened who knows what kind of importation God will give who knows how he will honor our obedience and come down who knows that he'll not give us services that cannot be timed that will go on in hours in such an excursion and
48:40 -  journey that we're in heaven where not so much as a baby whimpers or a kid is restless and rise in his seat for God is present and makes us to ride on the high places of the earth and gives us the heritage of Jacob because we have been
48:55 -  obedient to be doers of a word and have desisted from our own pleasure and from our own way and speaking our own word that's enough to terrify nine out of ten pastors right on the spot because if there's any if there's any day that is
49:17 -  steeped in sweat that is full of grimy exertion and labors that profane the Sabbath it's Sunday men who are speaking their own words breaking their necks over the concordance to come up with some novelty and some clever some cute
49:39 -  some acceptable things to be winsome and acceptable and colorful and quaint and attractive and impressive and biblical come on guys you can't fool me let's let's confess up Sunday is the most rugged demanding and sweaty day of the
49:56 -  week it's ironic that we've come so full circle that the day that should be the Lord's Day and the day of rest and the Sabbath of God is big has become for us the most hectic the most frenetic the most frantic the most sweaty of all days
50:09 -  of the week we can't wait for it to be over to finally loose our tie and let out a sigh that the work the labor is finished then Monday becomes our day of doing our own pleasure and speaking our own word what would it mean to face
50:28 -  a Sunday in the rest of God and trust that he would supply his own word you not only have to put up with the faces of your kids because they are detained from playing ball you have to put up with the faces of your congregation as
50:45 -  you stand there silently in chokes and slutters waiting for that which comes out of the rest of God and is his work and glorifies the father and not your expertise or human eloquence or religious ability I don't think that we're
51:05 -  going to come to this all at once but we need to start coming to it I think it's rather remarkable and I've never seen it before because Lauren has been eluding several times in these days to chapter 58 as a key of something that God is
51:21 -  restoring and that until we do it until we break the bonds of wickedness and do the bands of the yoke and let the oppressed go free and and feed the hungry and divide our bread and bring the homeless poor into the house and and see
51:33 -  the naked and cover them that we're not going anywhere this is the righteousness that God is waiting for indeed in acts of righteousness and further on in a chapter it says and those who among you will rebuild the ancient rooms you'll
51:50 -  raise up the asial foundations you'll be called the repair of the breach the restorer of the past in which to dwell this is the work of restoration this is bringing back that which was lost of the liberal church the call the social
52:01 -  gospel in which they were involved in social issues and we fundamentally only in the gospel of salvation this is something that needs desperately to be restored not as an alternative to salvation but as the expression of a
52:14 -  genuine salvation that that expresses the grieved and sorrowing concerned heart of God for despairing mankind that needs to be fed and closed and helped these are acts of restoration and little isn't it strange that in between these
52:30 -  acts and following the scripture that you shall restore the past to dwell and comes the verses if because of the Sabbath you turn your foot from doing your own pleasure my holy day how did that get in there because it too needs
52:44 -  to be restored and I want to say tonight for the first time ever anywhere that I believe now that this restoration of this Sabbath this true acknowledgement this deed is as imperative to be restored to the people of God as feeding
53:07 -  the hungry and dividing our bread and bringing bringing the homeless poor to our house and covering the destitute and the naked and that somehow they're connected that we're not going to be able to do the one without the other
53:20 -  because this is a work that glorifies the father that needs to be born out of the rest of God and needs to be performed in the rest of God or the work itself will destroy us and crush us with this overwhelming demand we have got to
53:35 -  be a people who know how to come into the midst of the most demanding activity and perform it out of God's rest as I myself am doing before you right now
