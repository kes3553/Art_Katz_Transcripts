Rebuilding the House of God

00:00 -  So verse 3, Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai, the prophet, saying, Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your sealed houses, and this house lie waste? Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider your ways.
00:19 -  You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you have not enough. You drink, you are not filled with drink. You clothe you, but there is none warm. And he that earns wages, earns wages to put it into a bag with holes.
00:34 -  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.
00:45 -  You looked for much, and lo, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts, Because of mine house that is waste.
00:55 -  And you run every man into his own house. Therefore the heaven over you has stayed from dew, the earth has stayed from her fruit,
01:03 -  and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, upon the new wine, upon the oil, upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men,
01:13 -  and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hens. What's the application for us? Or is this just a piece of quaint historic interest,
01:26 -  but no valid present application? Would you say the house of the LORD? Yeah? Anybody want to venture a definition of what the real house of the LORD is?
01:38 -  Above and apart from the whole welter of religious phenomena, that cloud housing, churches, movements, denominations, ministries, what is the house of the LORD over which he's jealous?
01:51 -  So we need to have a sense of those things that lie beyond definition and beyond words. Not only for the house of the LORD, but for everything. Lest we become categorical, brittle saints who know,
02:09 -  and have it down pat. That's worse than ignorance. The LORD would much rather have you pliable, gasping, and awkward, and choke,
02:18 -  and unable to define, then you should have it down pat, and turn it out with Australian-type efficiency. But everything you've said is so.
02:31 -  But it's yet beyond, and so is it with everything in God. But this much we know, for him it's ultimate. And he's affronted, he's offended, that it's not made first priority
02:44 -  by his own people, who are seeing rather to their own self-interest, and leaving him as a secondary and later consideration. Would you say that that's probably an appropriate statement for today?
02:56 -  I would, yeah. And how many of us here, better than most saints that we are, are guilty of that? How many of us are guilty of that without being conscious of that?
03:10 -  And that we have unconsciously subscribed to a kind of a conventional wisdom that implies take care of yourself first. If you don't, who else will?
03:20 -  And then if you have time over, Sunday, midweek services, I'm just trying to say, I'm talking like the fool. Is that okay?
03:28 -  You can't, you're stuck. I'm talking aloud, I'm thinking aloud, I'm brooding and reflecting as we go. And so all of these comments are totally unedited, unprepared, they're just coming.
03:44 -  Take what you can, let the rest fall to the ground. So I'm thinking that more than we know, unconsciously, that's where it's most dangerous. We have yielded to a kind of a conventional wisdom that makes our own interest foremost.
04:03 -  And nobody will reprove us for it because we all subscribe to the same unspoken premise. And that, therefore, describes our normative Christianity. Us first, even our religious interest, spiritual interest first,
04:20 -  and then, so to speak, the house of the Lord. We have, like them, we're guilty of a reversed priority. And what's worse, as I've said, we're not even conscious of this shift.
04:35 -  And we subscribe to it universally, and therefore no one will ever bring us to task. But we need to see what God is saying here. We need to see how He not only reproves, but that He judges.
04:52 -  And that He judges through natural phenomena, so that if you have not a discreet sense of God active in life and history, you would dismiss it as blight, as drought, as just a poor season, bad crop. But He makes quite clear, therefore, because of this, this.
05:13 -  Let's look at that. After being told to consider our ways, you look for much, it came to little. Why? Verse 9, sayeth the Lord of hosts.
05:26 -  Notice the frequency of Lord of hosts. Why is that continually being tacked on of all of the aspects of God by which He could be identified here in almost every sayeth the Lord of hosts?
05:41 -  Aronoi Shabaoth, the captain of the host of the army. So it's sort of God wanting to be heard and considered in a certain posture, a certain aspect of His deity that somehow fits in with what is being said here.
06:01 -  Why? God's giving explanation. Because my house is waste, and you run every man into his own house. Therefore, are you keen about the therefores?
06:12 -  The therefores are pregnant, full of meaning, and must not be lost to us. For few Christians there are in our generation who have a sense of the judgments of God. Fewer yet who sense them appreciate them.
06:31 -  Fewer yet those who appreciate them love them. So you're looking upon that kind of a freak who not only acknowledges the judgments of God, but loves the judgments of God.
06:43 -  They're invariably painful, as judgment of necessity must be, but they bespeak the righteousness of God and how far He will go to attain it. And I appreciate that.
06:57 -  Even when it comes personally and it's painful, yet the end of it is always redemptive. It's not punitive. It's not God punishing. You did this, you naughty boy, take this. No.
07:10 -  You did this, but in order to correct you from continuing this, I'm giving you this. So you might understand the magnitude of your error and correct it. So His judgments are redemptive, and so are they here.
07:26 -  And how precious of Him to instruct His people, tell them why, lest they be confused and not understand the cause and effect, nature of God. Because this, this. Because this, therefore.
07:43 -  And what is the therefore? The heavens over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. I called for a drought upon the land.
07:55 -  What kind of a God is that? Does He mean? Or is that loving? Because if His house lies in neglect, what will the consequence be?
08:06 -  Not only for the people of God, but for the nations round about and the world itself. If the world has lost its pivot, its nexus, its base in sanity and righteousness and truth, if there's not a visible expression of God through a people of God in a house of God,
08:26 -  what is to be expected in a pagan world? That's why He's jealous for His name, for His house, for His honor. It's not an egoistic God.
08:36 -  He's not that way. But He is concerned with what the world will be if He and His house suffers visible neglect. Therefore, because the stakes are so high, because the issues are so great, He will go this far.
08:55 -  He will withhold the dew, the elementary things that we take for granted. He'll shake the earth. He'll bring drought. I called for a drought upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the corn, the new wine, the oil,
09:08 -  upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men. Not just on nature, but men in nature. How would you like to experience a drought? Personally.
09:19 -  How many of us are experiencing that? And I hear for that reason. Better than hope for some magical answer to your drought, you would be wise to ask,
09:29 -  why am I suffering it? Why am I dry? Why am I arid? Why is the Bible dead for me?
09:37 -  Why is prayer a mechanical exercise? Why is my witness rarely if ever forthcoming? And if it does, it's lame, it's weak, it's inept.
09:47 -  Why am I in drought? Why has He withheld the dew? For your life. Could it be for the same reason?
09:54 -  Some neglect of the true priorities? Ask Him and get your house, get His house in order, and I think He'll renew the moisture. I love God for this.
10:06 -  Remember we prayed this morning? Lord, who of us knows You as we ought? And the single factor that has most limited our understanding of You as You in fact are
10:17 -  is our inability to see, appreciate, and to love Your judgments. Because we're squeamish and soft and we like things nice. We want to dwell upon Your kindness, Your love, Your mercy.
10:31 -  But we're such adults, we're so thick that we have not understood what is His mercy outside from His judgment. His judgments are invariably, His mercy is invariably an answer to His judgment.
10:45 -  And in the last analysis, if we understood rightly, His judgments are a mercy. Isn't it a mercy to know why there's a drought? And that it's not some inexplicable happenstance?
10:58 -  That life and history is not, what's the word, accidental and you just live with it? But God is implicit in time and circumstance and nations and in our own lives and this is the way He expresses Himself if we could but read and understand it.
11:17 -  God forbid we should fall into a secular mindset that looks upon earthquakes and tsunamis and droughts as somehow accidents of history, geophysical disturbances that come and you're not to read any special meaning in it.
11:34 -  I would rather read a special meaning in it and found that I'm wrong and that I've exaggerated God's place in it than I should dismiss God's place from it. It would be wise for us always, whether we're considering drought or any adverse circumstance,
11:50 -  not to dismiss it as some aberration that just happens but ask first, what is it that God is saying through this? What kind of correction is He wanting to bring?
12:03 -  Where am I amiss and I would not have noticed or taken it into consideration if it were not for these circumstances that have come that pinch me. We need to be pinched.
12:16 -  So He's pinching these people and He's sending a prophet to pinch them because the Word of the Lord is coming through this prophet because we're going to read in verse 12 that He sent.
12:30 -  Love that word? Did any juice break forth in your mouth when you heard it? Saliva beginning to run?
12:38 -  Lick your chops? And you've not yet understood it. You've not yet received it.
12:44 -  It's not yet hit home. Sent. The prophet was sent.
12:52 -  It was the Word of the Lord, not some piece of His own imagination. Though He might rightly have understood the drought and the corn and the oil suffering and could by His own mind have put it together
13:05 -  because He has a prophetic way of perceiving, that does not justify His speaking even though it be correct. The Word would be worthless except it be sent.
13:17 -  Did you get that? Because so many of you and the Church and the so-called prophets are adding up and making deductions and fathoming things rightly
13:29 -  and expressing it, but it's not the Word of the Lord. However correct, it's still not the Word of the Lord. Therefore, it does not accomplish what only the Word of the Lord can being sent.
13:42 -  See how jealous you have to be? That's why I don't allow myself the luxury of finding my own inspiration. Can you imagine a guy like me, the way I'm strung by,
13:53 -  all I have to do is open any book, any prophet or anything contemporary and I can be inflamed and go off on that basis. So I almost have to keep myself from choosing those things by which I will be stimulated,
14:09 -  lest it issues forth in something that has not had its origin in Him, however correct it might be. The fact that it would bless you does not justify it.
14:20 -  There are more important things than feeling blessed or being edified by something correct. We need a living Word sent of God that accomplishes the purpose
14:33 -  whereunto it is sent will not return to Him void and it might not express itself as felt blessing. Those who would prefer the sent Word,
14:43 -  even though it does not eventuate in a enjoyable feeling, are already on their way to becoming sons. If we're still at the feeling stage and want blessing
14:58 -  that is performed by artful ministers who know how to pluck the appropriate string and sound the appropriate chord, then your maturity and sonship is being curtailed.
15:12 -  I've already said enough, the Lord has already said enough even now that we could go home for the day and we've received the full measure. Rich insight about what are the constituent elements that make for sonship,
15:26 -  the appreciation of the judgments of God, the jealousy for that which is exclusively sent from the throne, which does not necessarily mean that it's going to bring a quotient of felt blessing.
15:38 -  It might bring the opposite. It might bring conviction. But to desire that above felt blessing is already a statement of maturity toward sonship. Bless the Lord.
15:54 -  So you see how we're running over this chapter not verse by verse, though I commend verse by verse. In fact, we should have been prepared if I knew in advance that you would have read it
16:08 -  and then we can leap and go back and forth and draw out, which is the root meaning of the word education. Educare in Latin means to draw out, not impose or impart instruction.
16:25 -  You learn something. It's yours when it comes out from you and is part of your realization. And few teachers there are who know that and have the skill from the Holy Spirit
16:41 -  to draw out so that the congregation or the individual is discovering for himself a realization of truth that is his own. Maybe that's why so many of us are so brittle.
16:54 -  We have truths, but they have been imparted, we've subscribed, but we've not internalized, made them our own. That's why I say if you're not yet salivating with the word scent is sounded,
17:08 -  you have not yet obtained it. Because what does that mean? Scent.
17:13 -  Think of it. What a dynamic from the enthronement of God in heaven down to this place in Australia. That's a remarkable transmission from heaven to earth,
17:29 -  and it's not some arbitrary thing that he's sending, but some explicit, sovereignly determined thing, even predetermined, that is on time, choice in the precision of his love and will.
17:45 -  What do you think about them apples? Don't just think, oh, scent, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but what does that mean?
17:54 -  What's implied? Something, what is being sent is ordained, not arbitrary, not just a chance thing, however blessed, anything that comes from God is blessed,
18:06 -  but to think that it's an ordained thing and a time thing whose moment has come and that we're privileged to be the corporate setting into which it comes. Remarkable.
18:20 -  And if you're the instrument like me through whom it comes, you have to say with Paul who is sufficient for these things. Hey, this is church, guys.
18:31 -  This is really church, and it's transforming, transfiguring. Can you imagine this every day, every Sunday? Why not?
18:43 -  He has something to send, but how much opportunity do we give him? Remember I said last night, he's like the dove. What's his name?
18:53 -  Noah sent out the raven, never came back. The raven, the filthy bird, unclean, and yet he fed Elijah, and Elijah was not squeamish and said, hey, I'm kosher.
19:09 -  But a raven will roost any place, anything that floats, even human excreture, if anything should be left in that flood, it will rest on it. Not so the dove.
19:21 -  The dove came back and found not a place for its feet. You impose yourself religiously, as we're doing, more than your conscious, and the dove will just recede.
19:33 -  And the more he recedes, the more you're compelled to fill the silence and turn up the amplifier and give it a little bit more zap. The more zap, the more he recedes.
19:46 -  A remarkable, delicate thing of which we need to be conscious and not ourselves unconsciously trying to affect an atmosphere. So let's read that 12th verse.
19:58 -  Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and I'm sure these names are all full of meaning. Joshua, the son of Yosedech, the high priest, all the remnant of the people.
20:13 -  Remember now that these are only the few that came back from Babylon. The greater majority that had been cast into exile remained. They were getting it good, and they were making a lifestyle
20:25 -  which we Jews have established in exile throughout our history all over the world. Who wants to go back to a destroyed city, a destroyed temple? It's painful, and even here in the text somewhere it says,
20:40 -  for those of you who remember the temple as it once was, now you have to look at the shabby ruins and the pitiful thing being raised up that doesn't even begin
20:51 -  to touch the glory that once was. Aren't you better off to remain in Babylon and retain the image of the thing as it once was
21:00 -  rather than come back and see the ruins to which it has been brought and the pitiful attempt to build something in its place? What would your preference be?
21:08 -  Prefer the image that should be undisturbed, that you can retain it, the lovely thoughts of what it once was, and get rhapsodic and melancholy
21:17 -  and go off on a little trip from time to time? Or pick up and leave the comforts of Babylon and even your own wistful reminiscences
21:26 -  and come back to the actuality of the place and the evidence of its judgment and be cut to the quick to see it and be in it
21:35 -  and to labor to bring something in its place? As for me and my house, I'll be where the ruins are. Painful, but instructive.
21:48 -  God forbid we should forget it. It's a statement that God allowed His own temple to be utterly destroyed.
21:55 -  I'm on a one-man crusade against sentimentality and romanticism. They are both vicious lies contrary to reality,
22:09 -  and yet how many subscribe to it? Because it feels good and it's nice and pleasant. So to see through sentimentality
22:23 -  takes a certain kind of love for reality and things as they are that doesn't have to be coded. We can take it nakedly as it is as real
22:34 -  and go on facing that truth from truth to truth, faith to faith, to sonship. But if we need to have something disguised,
22:44 -  coded over, we're already in an unreal place. And so it's a real choice. I've never before ever, this is the first time,
22:54 -  I'm going to have to put a plaque on the door one day. The revelation that had come for the first time that there's a choice of remaining in exile in Babylon,
23:04 -  which is itself one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Hanging Gardens. Babylon is lush.
23:13 -  The Jews do not take long to learn its language, to accommodate themselves to its culture, and to prosper there.
23:20 -  And if they get religious on the high holidays, they can have a wistful reminiscence of what Jerusalem once was.
23:27 -  And even as Daniel, when he prayed three times a day, he prayed and faced Jerusalem. Or you can be the remnant, the word is used here,
23:38 -  who choose to return, face the grim reality of judgment and devastation, and the enormous, arduous labor
23:48 -  of restoring a destroyed house of God. Wow. What's the present-day application in this?
23:59 -  How many of us are spiritually preferring and are in a Babylon that is much more accommodating than the grim condition of the church as it presently is,
24:12 -  and are laboring there, having the apostolic vision of what it once was when the glory of God was in his house,
24:21 -  unto him be glory in the church, and now seeing the melancholy condition of the present church,
24:31 -  and remaining and abiding in it, and laboring with it and through it to bring it again to be a house
24:39 -  appropriate to his glory. Good. Instructive, huh? And you thought it was just history.
24:47 -  Very applicable. And don't think we're exhausting the applications. I'm just talking off the top of my head.
24:54 -  Imagine if we really started to think about it, and we need to. That's why it's here,
25:00 -  for its present value, not for its antiquity. So what else are you seeing here? What about the phrase, consider your ways?
25:08 -  Isn't that a pregnant phrase? Consider your ways? That's from God.
25:14 -  He's saying that through the prophet. He's not saying consider that you have defaulted, consider that you've misplaced priority.
25:23 -  This is a much larger term. Consider your ways. Consider your mode of being.
25:30 -  Consider your mentality, out of which this defunct neglect of my house is but an expression.
25:41 -  You need to consider the much larger thing out of which your failure stems. Hey, this is good.
25:49 -  Praise God it's being recorded. I'm going to need to hear myself again. I'm joking and boasting, saints, for your sake.
26:01 -  Can you understand that? Because the same phenomenon that you're seeing right on the spot of never before seen
26:11 -  and something lights up, there's an illumination, is exactly the way he wants you to be and live. This isn't the ministerial privilege.
26:20 -  It's your privilege as well. If you're in the life, and the life is continually bubbling and percolating,
26:28 -  there's a spirit of revelation that is continually flowing. And I don't think it's because I'm Jewish or because it's me.
26:36 -  I think it's God's normative intention for every saint. If you would get yourself out of the way and allow that life to flow
26:46 -  and give it his own expression as was not too evident in your prayer this morning. I had even gently to reprimand those who prayed
26:57 -  that they would be embarrassed by hearing themselves as being religious, all too religious. If you've never heard God pray through you,
27:06 -  you're missing a treat. Because we prophetic men, few that we are, who are sent, have an obligation not only to expose it,
27:15 -  but to demonstrate. That must not be lost to you. And you're being extraordinarily treated this morning
27:22 -  to the thing in action, on the spot, alive. Isn't that remarkable? Wow! If it were not for that,
27:31 -  how could I have started in Singapore where every word and every meeting and every message, much was hanging in the balance,
27:41 -  I can't describe to you the enormity of what was at stake that will affect all China one day in that Chinese congregation of 700
27:50 -  where I had been previously and they were zapped. And now I'm coming back again and every opening your mouth anew
27:58 -  runs the risk of collapse, disappointment, failed expectancy. We thought art was, but now listen to him. He's lost the edge or whatever it is.
28:10 -  There's a risk of coming back again. And I came back and the Lord, though I dreaded coming up to the pulpit the first time,
28:19 -  brought us through message by message. And after that you want to retire. But there's no time.
28:26 -  You've got to make the flight to New Zealand via Sydney and then come back to Sydney and then up to Melbourne. And so it's Singapore and then New Zealand.
28:38 -  Again, the Lord did the same thing again. Extraordinary. Where I have two New Zealand sons.
28:43 -  I've got a Malaysian son who's Chinese. I've got a Ugandan son who's black. And I acquired a new Chinese son even in Melbourne.
28:51 -  Many sons has Father Abraham. I'm saying all that to say this is exhausting. This will drain anyone.
29:01 -  I don't care how many messages he has in his briefcase. He's got to come to an end of them unless he's in the life. Then the life is without limit, infinite, endless, indestructible
29:15 -  and has its own expression out working. This is a very long time together. I think I could have made it three or four days.
29:24 -  But we're only together a week. So God's on the spot. We'll see if he'll run out.
29:32 -  We'll see if he has nothing to say after the third or fourth day. Or he'll right on. So be sure to catch everything God is wanting you to observe
29:44 -  for your own encouragement and for the release of the spirit of life in his life. Because unlike you, I have already had communion this morning.
29:54 -  Somewhere around 4.30 a.m. Because I knew the demand of this day, and I needed again to be strengthened and fortified
30:04 -  in the inner man by the body and blood of the Lord. And now you're receiving the benefit. The life that is giving these illuminations, raising these questions,
30:13 -  it's a remarkable thing. Is it exclusive to the prophetic man or the sent man? Or is it intended for the Church
30:21 -  that God intends itself to be a prophetic entity? That's why it's so important to observe the individual who is in that calling.
30:29 -  Because more than we know, it's our corporate calling. It doesn't mean we're all going to be prophetic, per se, in that sense. But the corporate reality will have this nature, this disposition, this reality.
30:43 -  And be a blessing to the Earth as the prophetic individual is a blessing to the body. Okay, so what does it mean?
30:52 -  Consider your ways. Not just the boo-boo. Not just the instance of this particular failing.
30:59 -  If you just considered that, you would have missed it. And if it pleases the Lord, He's quickening already in these days,
31:08 -  it would be a crime to deny you, of Psalm 51, the repentant cry of David. Oh God, blot out my transgressions,
31:19 -  for I was conceived in iniquity. It doesn't mean his mother was in a poor moral state at the time of her conception.
31:27 -  But what he's saying is, I was born to this condition. Yes, even as the sweet singer of Israel. Even as Israel's greatest king.
31:36 -  And what happened to me in adultery and murder is but the point of the reality breaking forth into actual act. But the deeper reality is the iniquity, the nature,
31:54 -  the sinful condition, the depraved human condition, which was always mine and was not recognized until its act was made manifest.
32:03 -  I need to consider my ways. And not just the boo-boo of the act of adultery. I'm not making light of that.
32:11 -  It's a sinful act. But let's not get hung up on the act and miss the nexus out of which the act issues.
32:18 -  When God is saying consider your ways, you're saying consider the whole mode of your life and being out of which this neglect for my house expresses itself.
32:31 -  But if you only examine the neglect, you'll miss the larger issue. Can you follow that?
32:38 -  Consider your ways. I like the word consider. I think generally speaking, we're not a thinking church.
32:46 -  Do you agree with that? Almost mindless. We've got our pet doctrines and things like that.
32:53 -  But where do you find Christians who are thinkers? That's why I love P.T. Forsythe, whom I will be commending to in these days.
33:02 -  My most recent discovery, British, died in 1928. But what he has left behind? His books.
33:12 -  Rich, rich. The man's a thinker. On top of that, he's a poet.
33:17 -  His thinking is expressed in literary terms, which are a delight to read. So we need to see how stunted we are.
33:28 -  I don't want to be insulting in any way, but I think it was a blessing to bring to the attention of my brothers in the prayer time this morning
33:38 -  that you're religious, much too religious. And your religiosity is precluding and negating the opportunity for a true spirituality.
33:50 -  And that the real praying in the last analysis is not our prayers, but his. To hear God's prayer out of your mouth
33:57 -  is an exquisite blessing. And often they are insane. The magnitude of his prayers,
34:05 -  we wouldn't dare to conceive of them ourselves. So we need to consider. And considering his work,
34:16 -  thought and reviewing and looking back and examining and putting together what's happened in nature with a nagging thing
34:28 -  in our own conscience, is a very good process. God forbid that the church should be thoughtless
34:36 -  and mindless. Because it's unbecoming a son. Isn't that right?
34:46 -  For a son of God to be thoughtless and mindless and not able to consider, not able to weigh up, to evaluate,
34:56 -  is contrary to what a son is. And how much does the world need a presence like that? So I like this admonition.
35:08 -  Consider your ways in verse 7. And it's in verse 5, maybe in more times than that.
35:15 -  But I'll tell you what, if he only says it twice, how many more times must he say it? When God repeats himself,
35:23 -  we had better hearken. And he's not just speaking to the generation of Haggai, he's speaking to us.
35:31 -  Consider your ways. Consider the whole totality, your mode of being, your mindset,
35:37 -  your disposition, your values, the things that you esteem, the use of your time,
35:43 -  the secret things that you don't even allow to come to the level of your consciousness, but are true in your deeps.
35:49 -  Consider. And verse 8, go up to the mountain, because any going up is going to be arduous, right?
35:56 -  Let alone to come back down slapping wood. Go up so that you might bring back wood. The faith is arduous.
36:06 -  Have you noticed? And if it's not for you, you're out of it. If faith has become convenient,
36:13 -  makes no requirement, you're not required to extend yourself, and there's no demand,
36:19 -  how are you in the faith? There's something intrinsic to the faith that requires a going up.
36:25 -  So what would be bringing wood? This house, the basic building material, what would be the spiritual analogy?
36:34 -  What would be the equivalent to wood for the house? What would it be today that constitutes the house of God, as you guys have already said?
36:42 -  It's made up of believers. We are the house, but the house is incomplete.
36:48 -  So go up there and bring back others who will be part of its structure, as they're incorporated
36:56 -  into a house not made with hands. What does Paul say in Ephesians? A dwelling,
37:02 -  a habitation for the Holy Spirit, made up of us believing. Are you bringing down the wood?
37:12 -  Are you going up to get it? Are you willing for the exertion, the strain, especially Jewish wood,
37:19 -  the most exquisite kind there is, because it's hard? Who's going up for that?
37:25 -  What a labor to hack at that and bring that down. They are proud timber
37:31 -  and resist the axe or the saw, and are quite sufficient and want to remain in their own lofty heights.
37:39 -  Where's the believer that will go up and brave that and face that and bring that down?
37:46 -  He'll have to be a mighty woodsman, be able to swing a hammer and be able to swing a hefty axe
37:54 -  and pull out a saw with another without being exhausted. The house of the Lord is not complete
38:01 -  till they're in it, you dear saints. Can you imagine that guys like me should be absent
38:07 -  and that the house should be totally Gentile? Forbid the thought. It needs the riches of the nations,
38:18 -  the rare woods to be found in this place and that, Ceylon and India and Nepal
38:24 -  and God knows where else, but especially the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
38:30 -  That will not be obtained without a going up, effort of an ultimate kind
38:36 -  and being confronted with resistance. And as I have been in my tenure now in New York for almost three years,
38:45 -  being related to a rabbi once a week, talk about going up, I drove 150 miles once a week
38:52 -  for four, five or six hours with one rabbi. I'll tell you what, dear saints, I would have driven 300 miles.
38:59 -  I would have driven 500 miles plus the gas, which I calculated and the tolls, $17
39:07 -  in bridges and toll roads to get to one rabbi. What I got from that rabbi
39:13 -  was inestimable. Fifth generation Talmudic scholar. So slight you can put him in your pocket.
39:21 -  I was twice at his home, stayed overnight. Seven beautiful, well-mannered children.
39:28 -  It was an education for me and I'm Jewish, to see the reality of
39:34 -  authentic, orthodox Jewish life. What a privilege. And why is the man willing to see me?
39:42 -  He wants a feather for his cap. He knows who I am in the purposes of God,
39:55 -  though I've been deceived by the deceiver, there's yet hope that I could be a teacher of Torah.
40:02 -  And so he was willing to expend himself. We had times the sparks flew. Can you imagine the collision
40:10 -  of Jews like that? I didn't realize, and I hope you'll receive this well,
40:17 -  how deep, how inveterate, how unfailingly bitter is the animosity and vehemence
40:24 -  against Jesus the Christ. Still, as profoundly in Jewish life now as it was when they were instrumental
40:33 -  in his crucifixion. I needed to know that. I did not know that.
40:39 -  It's important for me to know how resistant, how stiff, how trained, if they had 2,000 years at this.
40:47 -  I didn't know about the statements in the Talmud in Hebrew of that deceiver
40:54 -  and what they call him by name and how his birth is the result of an illicit relationship
41:00 -  of a woman with a Roman soldier. They've had generations to perfect their arguments
41:07 -  against the faith. This man carries a New Testament. But for what purpose?
41:14 -  Ammunition to dissuade those Jews who have been seduced by this Greek pagan religion
41:23 -  that has to do with miraculous birth, death, and resurrection. He's tough,
41:32 -  but I love him to pieces. The car broke down. On one of my trips to him,
41:39 -  traffic was back to back on a hot day and my transmission overheated and I finally limped into the town
41:47 -  closest to him, got a lift to the place where we meet. He had to take me back to the garage
41:52 -  where they were putting my car together. And as we drove off, I'll always remember I said,
41:59 -  YIsrael Chaim Blumenthal, pray for him, that no man has ever loved you as I.
42:06 -  For all of your Jewish compatriots, your Orthodox kinsmen, you have never known
42:14 -  the love of a man for your soul as mine. And he went like this. So our relationship has been broken off.
42:21 -  He finally came to the place where he had to give up on me. I was with him a year
42:27 -  and I still did not see the light. I'm still insistent on the faith. So he became insulting,
42:33 -  more than insulting, he became blasphemous and it was just pointless to continue.
42:38 -  But the relationship remains. Something has been birthed and God will call for it in some future time.
42:46 -  I invited him to come up to Minnesota, to our community, and address us.
42:51 -  And I said, we will cater in your food. I know you can't eat our tref,
42:57 -  our unclean, uncocious stuff, but we will cater in your food if you'll come.
43:04 -  Well, he smiled, but there will be a day when he will come. Not just to address us,
43:11 -  but to flee from the terrible persecutions that will fall upon Jews of this kind, of his kind, in New York City.
43:19 -  So when you drive 150 miles for five hours with an outraged rabbi,
43:27 -  you have a little glimpse of what it means to go up and bring back wood.
43:32 -  Wood to God that every one of you had an exertion of this kind to make. If it's easy, something is wrong.
43:39 -  There's a requirement. And God has got to exhort us, my house is not complete,
43:44 -  till it's every piece is in place. Every kind of wood. Wood is the symbol for humanity.
43:53 -  The Ark of God was wood. And it was made of the lowest, most common wood, shrub,
43:59 -  to be found in the wilderness. What do they call that? Somebody?
44:03 -  Shittim. And it's all twisted and gnarled, it has to be planed,
44:09 -  but it had to be covered in gold within and without. Isn't it remarkable?
44:14 -  What a picture of God and us. He doesn't despise the wood, he employs it,
44:20 -  but he covers it within and without. His house is not complete, until his appointed kinsmen are in it.
44:29 -  And if you're not the ones that go to get them, who will? They'll not come of themselves.
44:34 -  Bring wood, build a house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, say the Lord.
44:40 -  Don't miss that part. I will take pleasure in it. Did you catch my prayer sitting there
44:49 -  when we finished this morning? About the sovereignty of God and what he will be pleased to unfold,
44:55 -  that his soul will be gratified and that his heart will be warmed. Not that we will be blessed.
45:01 -  That's not the first concern. His heart be gratified. His soul be blessed.
45:07 -  Do you pray like that? Do you think like that? Consider your ways.
45:11 -  You've been too foremost in your own consideration. Your blessing, your enjoyment,
45:15 -  your benefit, have you thought of him? Hey, he doesn't get much satisfaction in the world.
45:22 -  You know that? He gets a lot of blasphemy, a lot of cursing,
45:27 -  a lot of condemnation, a lot of rejoicing. He's dragged through the mud.
45:31 -  Where does he get something to warm his own heart? There's a Jewish word for this.
45:37 -  There's a Jewish word for everything. The benefit, the blessing, the warmth, the compensation.
45:46 -  Because he says, you build a house and I will take pleasure in it.
45:52 -  That's all we need to know, saints. That's worth slogging up the mountain, cutting down the trees that resist us,
46:00 -  and bringing them down and fitting them into the structure if he will take pleasure in it.
46:05 -  If he will take pleasure in it, do we need to know more? Do we need to have any other motive?
46:11 -  Are you that way? Are you formed like that, that you're foremost thought,
46:16 -  that you're foremost thought, how does this glorify God? How does this bless him?
46:21 -  Will his heart be warmed to hear this, to see this? If you have this
46:25 -  as your foremost consideration, you might become a saint and a son. But it needs to be conscious
46:33 -  and that you live in it in so a continual way that you no longer have to be conscious of it.
46:38 -  It is always a living factor. It is always operative. Unconsciously, your thought,
46:46 -  your heart, your disposition is, does this delight his soul? Am I warming his heart?
46:54 -  Does he find pleasure in this? Is he receiving naches, that's the word, thank you Lord,
47:00 -  from the name nachum, satisfaction, pleasantry? Because if he doesn't get it from us saints,
47:10 -  where is he going to get his naches? The world will not give it to him. The world will only continue to insult him.
47:17 -  He deserves a little naches, a little satisfaction, a little pleasure,
47:22 -  a little warmth for his heart. And I suspect I'm not being extravagant to say he's getting it this morning.
47:29 -  He's enjoying this morning as much or as more than we. What do you think of that?
47:37 -  Go up and do this, I'll take pleasure in it. That's all I need to know Lord.
47:42 -  I'll go up, I'll be resisted. I'll find obstacles. This will challenge me to the hilt.
47:48 -  I'm much more at ease to stay below. But if this is what it takes for you to find pleasure,
47:54 -  I will do it. Of course I'll need every grace which he will supply.
48:00 -  But you have now the incentive. Not your denomination, not your ministry, not your career, his house.
48:06 -  I'll take delight in that. I won't take delight in your career. I'll take delight in the house
48:12 -  for my name and my presence. A house of prayer for all nations and made from all nations
48:19 -  and not the least, that nation. You want to know what makes an apostle an apostle? He has an incentive
48:26 -  greater than his love for the church. He has an incentive greater than his love for his own Jewish kinsmen.
48:33 -  And that incentive is the glory of God forever. If you have these two components, his delight and pleasure and his glory,
48:43 -  that's it. Everything else follows. You'll find yourself having your ponytail
48:49 -  cut off in the barbershop and your earring removed if you're so disposed.
48:55 -  And whatever else that was your pleasure and not his, it would make some radical requirement.
49:04 -  But we're willing, if it constitutes his pleasure and his glory.
49:10 -  For the want of that, the church is in its present lamentable condition.
49:16 -  And so what a message. And so to make sure that we're not hearing
49:23 -  the jaundiced views of a man and the generational gap, but that it's the heart and thought of God,
49:33 -  the Lord himself, make sure that you understand, as the Lord their God had sent him,
49:41 -  and the people did fear before the Lord in verse 12. They called Manaruti here
49:48 -  to consider their ways, but to obey the voice of the Lord their God and the words of Haggai the prophet,
49:55 -  as the Lord their God had sent him. He didn't come of his own volition. He didn't speak his own message.
50:02 -  In fact, the condition that he's touching has had a long-standing history. Why didn't he come earlier?
50:10 -  Didn't he see it? Was he impervious? Wasn't he aware?
50:15 -  Couldn't he have said a couple of years before what he's saying now?
50:21 -  It waits upon being sent. The appointed moment of God. So that the voice is as important
50:29 -  virtually as the content of the speaking. They obeyed the voice of the Lord. That's not just the Hebraism.
50:35 -  That's a deep spiritual truth lost to us moderns who are concerned only about the words.
50:42 -  Rightly that we should, but have you ever been concerned for the voice of the speaking?
50:48 -  Have you ever listened for it? Can you hear it when it comes? Can you discern it?
50:54 -  The voice is not just the vocal resonance. There's a note. There's an accent.
51:01 -  There's a disposition of urgency. There's a plea. There's a pleading.
51:07 -  Something comes through the voice not only of God, but us. How's your own voice?
51:13 -  I not only read men by their faces, I can hear it in their voices. There are some voices I can't bear to hear.
51:19 -  They are shrill and tinny and jangle
51:25 -  not only my ear, but my soul. Because the voice is not just an accident of physiology.
51:31 -  The voice is the composite sound of the whole personality reflecting its history
51:37 -  and its present relationship with God as God. How's your voice?
51:43 -  How's His voice? When do we get a chance to hear it? Through the prophets
51:49 -  who are sent. And if we are discerning, that would be enough to indicate
51:55 -  it's false, because the false prophet is going to say true things. He has elements
52:01 -  in his visions, though the visions themselves might be spurious. When you hear, you can
52:07 -  tell. There's something tinny, something human,
52:13 -  all too human. You don't get the sense of a history of the man of God.
52:19 -  These are thoughts worth considering, dear saints, especially in Australia. I don't know of another
52:25 -  national environment, except maybe the United States, that conspires against
52:31 -  spiritual reality and mystical considerations.
52:37 -  It's much too materialistic, much too mechanical, much too, I don't have a word
52:43 -  for it, and it doesn't have the ethos, E-T-H-O-S, the disposition for things
52:49 -  that are like the subject or the issue of voice. We Americans are, you know, hamburger
52:55 -  now, quick, quick food. You know what you're getting, and it doesn't matter in which
53:01 -  branch of the franchise you go, you get exactly the same thing. Weight on the scale, cooked the same way, same length of time,
53:07 -  same ingredients. We've been processed, and we're missing those
53:13 -  delicate things that make all the difference, that make a saint
53:19 -  the saint. The issue of the sensitivity in the sense for the things that are
53:25 -  mystical and defy definition, that are as important as definitions themselves.
53:31 -  There are dimensions that are wanting, and not the least of those dimensions
53:37 -  is an esteem and appreciation for the voice as well as the words of the Lord.
53:43 -  In fact, when you read God's judgment upon Israel, his judgment is, you did not
53:49 -  hearken to my voice. You only did the shell, the outward
53:55 -  requirement, but you missed the voice of my speaking. To miss his voice is to miss him.
54:01 -  And his voice came through Haggai, they obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words of Haggai
54:07 -  because the voice came with the words from one who is sent. As the Lord their God had sent him,
54:13 -  and the people did fear before the Lord. Whew!
54:19 -  Isn't that enough reason to take a moment's respectful silence just considering that
54:25 -  statement, and the people did fear before the Lord? Because I can tell you,
54:31 -  as a man who travels the world and sees the Church in its condition in
54:37 -  many places, if I have to finger one thing that is acute everywhere in its
54:43 -  absence, it is the fear of the Lord. It is simply non-existent.
54:49 -  The Church does not know it. How then is it the Church? What then can it communicate to the world
54:55 -  that would give a respect for the invisible God, his law, his commandments, his way, his
55:01 -  holiness, if we ourselves are not living in that fear? Which means we will be presumptuous,
55:07 -  do our own things, justify it, think we're doing God's service. The fear
55:13 -  of the Lord is a remarkable component. I've never ever spoken on it, but I can remember.
55:19 -  I don't know if there's any reference in any book. It deserves a book.
55:25 -  You tell me, what is the fear of the Lord? How important is it?
55:31 -  And how is it to be obtained? If they came, I'm just off the top of my head. And I'm
55:37 -  not saying to look my no hands how clever this is. This is the Lord, saints, bringing something forth right on the
55:43 -  spot. What am I doing with this text? I'm exegeting it. I'm drawing out
55:49 -  meanings that are implicit in this text that are inexhaustible. Where did the fear of the Lord come?
55:55 -  To Israel, slack in attending to the first priority of God in his house.
56:01 -  It came with the hearing both of the words and of the voice of the Lord through the prophet who
56:07 -  was sent. Okay? Now, to be a proper exegete,
56:13 -  what then is the application for us from that statement? What can we draw from that
56:19 -  when the question comes, why then is the fear of the Lord absent from the contemporary
56:25 -  church worldwide? Why? If it came
56:31 -  with the prophet, his words and voice as sent, they feared the Lord,
56:37 -  how do we explain the lack of that fear in our contemporary church? It's clear. No prophets.
56:43 -  No speaking. No sent ones. No words. No voice.
56:49 -  Because I do not believe that the present crop of those who are being applauded as prophets are sent.
56:55 -  Because there's no fear of the Lord even in their own presence and in their own speaking and in their own meetings.
57:01 -  In fact, my great complaint then chagrin is the likeness that pervades
57:07 -  those occasions. The frivolity, the easy, loose talk, the humor,
57:13 -  that does not inculcate a fear of the Lord. I'm not saying it has necessarily be solemn,
57:19 -  but how can they communicate it if they're not sent? And when you read Jeremiah
57:25 -  and Ezekiel about the false prophets, I did not send them, the Lord says. They ran, but I didn't send them.
57:31 -  They spoke out of their own fancy, their own dreams, their own visions, but I never gave it.
57:37 -  But those to whom they came who receive all of that are the shallow. What's the word?
57:45 -  Easily impressed. They want novelty. They like celebrity.
57:51 -  So there's a remarkable statement here. It's formulaic. It's a principle.
57:57 -  Fear of the Lord comes with not only the words, but the voice that comes with
58:03 -  prophet as one who is sent. What ought we to be praying then? Lord,
58:09 -  we are grieved for the absence of your fear in the Church. It's much
58:15 -  too casual, much too light, much too frivolous, much too insincere,
58:21 -  much too ambitious, much too programmed. Send the
58:27 -  word. Send the messenger who bears it. Let it
58:33 -  come with your voice, the urgency of your speaking, and let it affect what it alone can,
58:39 -  or else it would not come. The fear of the Lord. We ought to be praying that. So the Lord encouraged
58:45 -  them. I'm with you, saith the Lord. Stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel,
58:51 -  the governor, Joshua, the priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people.
58:57 -  And they came and did work in the house of the Lord of Hosts, dear God. He not only admonished them,
59:03 -  but He also supplied them. Is that right? Does that text indicate that? He stirred their
59:09 -  spirits. He not only gave them the fear, He gave them an enablement. Isn't that gracious?
59:15 -  Because He knows how massive the undertaking is to build the
59:21 -  house of God aright. That it should not be slip-shot and disjointed and at
59:27 -  crude angles. I'm the kind of guy who winces if I have to go to a motel
59:33 -  and I see that the electric light switch plate is just off kilter.
59:39 -  Or the faucet is turned just a little bit at an angle when it might just as well have been perfectly
59:45 -  aligned if the one who had installed it was careful to attend
59:51 -  to that little detail. But doesn't the lights switch work? Yeah. Doesn't the water flow? Yeah. But don't you
59:57 -  understand that there are issues greater than utility? There are issues more as equally as important
01:00:03 -  as light and water is the form, the correctness, the alignment, the beauty,
01:00:09 -  the symmetry, the rightness of something that could have easily have been done if we had attended
01:00:15 -  it in a Godly way. So whoever that clumsy carpenter or electrician
01:00:21 -  plumber was, it was not the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of the Lord would have seen to it
01:00:27 -  it's lined up perfectly. It's right. It's aesthetically pleasing as well as functioning.
01:00:33 -  But you you Australians and we Americans, utility
01:00:39 -  does it work? Is it expedient? Pragmatic? Does it do the job?
01:00:45 -  Get by? How about the beauty? How about the symmetry? How about the alignment?
01:00:51 -  Because if we're slipshot and sloppy in things like that are we going to be more careful in relationship?
01:00:57 -  More careful in service? More careful in ministry? If we don't watch the angles
01:01:03 -  and the other things that are incidental to life? How can we be observant about the one and not the other?
01:01:09 -  If we'll be slipshot in the one, we will be slipshot in the other. Careless in speech
01:01:15 -  in conduct the spirit of the Lord is with you that he might be glorified
01:01:21 -  and find pleasure in this building because it's a statement of who he is in himself
01:01:27 -  and what he is like who is perfect in all his ways. Got the idea?
01:01:33 -  That's why a man like me trembles to begin a series of days like this.
01:01:39 -  How do you begin it? It's got to be perfect. From beginning to end
01:01:45 -  if he's the Lord of it and provides the spirit for it, for the remnant people
01:01:51 -  which we are. That melancholy statement in Chapter 2 Who is left among you
01:01:57 -  that saw this house in her first glory? How do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison
01:02:03 -  of it as nothing? Yes. But is that a justification
01:02:09 -  to withdraw your involvement because you're set
01:02:15 -  back at the difference and it's not what you think it ought to be? It falls below the apostolic
01:02:21 -  standard. Is that a reason that you can extricate yourself from participation waiting for that which is perfect to
01:02:27 -  come? And your super spirituality and keeping your skirts high so it doesn't have to be
01:02:33 -  dragged through the mud of the present church or do you get in it and deal with it? Because if we are
01:02:39 -  too fastidious to be involved with the church in its present condition, being so
01:02:45 -  much less than the glory it once was because it offends our sensibilities and we're reserving
01:02:51 -  ourselves to the more perfect expression how will we be disposed to Jews
01:02:57 -  when they will come to us in a far from perfect condition? They are going to be marred
01:03:03 -  more than any man and if we have a studied religious life that is fastidious and exclusive
01:03:09 -  we will not be able to be to them what we would. Our relationship to the church now
01:03:15 -  in its present condition is a gift given from God to fit us
01:03:21 -  in mind, heart, attitude and spirit for being able to relate to them. If you can't relate with the church
01:03:27 -  now you'll not be able to relate with them later. So let's avoid that
01:03:33 -  pseudo spirituality that will not condescend to come down and to be involved with the church in its present
01:03:39 -  condition. I don't say subscribe to it. I don't say endorse it but certainly not to neglect it. It's still
01:03:45 -  however battered or however depleted the house of God that needs to be straightened and fitted
01:03:51 -  by your presence, your prayer, your participation, not your exclusion.
01:03:57 -  This chapter 2 contains the remarkable verses that we often quote
01:04:03 -  of what would happen in the latter days verses 6 and 7
01:04:09 -  Yet once it is a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea
01:04:15 -  and the dry land. I wonder if the tsunami can be fitted into that verse, the sea
01:04:21 -  and the dry land. I will shake it. Those pictures of the present condition where those waters went
01:04:27 -  over brought such tumult and upheaving. It's just a wasteland. I would rather believe
01:04:33 -  that God foresaw that is the author of that and it's already a fulfillment of
01:04:39 -  the latter days. I will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come.
01:04:45 -  So we see the shaking as horrible as it is we have a basis for encouragement.
01:04:51 -  It's the sign of his coming. Therefore we can bear it morally. Painful
01:04:57 -  though it is to see and to consider The Lord is soon to follow The desire of all
01:05:03 -  nations shall come I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of hosts But Lord it's an
01:05:09 -  expensive proposition. Well the silver is mine, the gold is mine the glory of this
01:05:15 -  latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give
01:05:21 -  peace saith the Lord of hosts and in this place only. Terrible discord
01:05:27 -  that's in the world, Iraq and all of the ugly things the death, the blood, the violence
01:05:33 -  will be at an end not when they are politically resolved but when the house of the Lord is established
01:05:39 -  in which he will dwell. Isn't that remarkable? Either that's a formula
01:05:45 -  for insanity or sanity because it will make you seem to the worldling
01:05:51 -  terribly impractical and that you're shunning the realities of political things
01:05:57 -  that need to be resolved but know you're waiting and believing for a true resolution and a true peace
01:06:03 -  not by an immediate involvement in the political crisis but in a thing
01:06:09 -  that time has waited and that is the capstone conclusion and consummation
01:06:15 -  of the ages, the house of the Lord in which he's glorified in which he will dwell
01:06:21 -  and out of which is peaceful issue. You know that unfits us for the world? To have convictions like that
01:06:27 -  to believe for that labor for that seems to be impractical
01:06:33 -  and even contends against practicality so much so that we might be even looked upon as
01:06:39 -  ironically an obstruction to peace because we have this lofty
01:06:45 -  ultimate end of the age consideration for which the world sees no evidence and we are not involved
01:06:51 -  in the things that they think will obtain peace and we are like the square thing
01:06:57 -  in a round hole and even a deterrent to ecumenical resolution
01:07:03 -  and religious and political unity and oneness by which peace is to be obtained
01:07:09 -  and your threat, your presence is of such a kind that finally they might consider killing us
01:07:15 -  and doing their God of service. So what I'm saying is you take the word of God seriously
01:07:21 -  yield to the reality of the word of what he says is the foundation
01:07:27 -  for peace that is totally impractical and unobtainable in the world side
01:07:33 -  and you become unfitted for the world and you'll stick out conspicuously against
01:07:39 -  the world. You'll be in opposition to its spirit and its mentality not only when you
01:07:45 -  speak and do but even just your presence as you are in silence. There's already
01:07:51 -  a valence of disturbance and enmity and difference with the world.
01:07:57 -  In a word you'll become a stranger pilgrim sojourner in the world to subscribe
01:08:03 -  to this and it's not automatic. You want to be out of tune with the world
01:08:09 -  or you want to be a Christian who can still be fun and one of the boys this is radical really
01:08:15 -  we need to recognize that and subscribe to that believe for that, give ourselves for that
01:08:21 -  even though the consequence for us is unpopularity
01:08:27 -  and sticking out increasingly in a conspicuous way not just to obtain the scorn
01:08:33 -  and the reproach of the world but its opposition and its violence. You get all that
01:08:39 -  art from that one statement? Yeah and I don't take back a word of it. We ought to get
01:08:45 -  all that out of that statement. So verse 18, consider now verse chapter 2, from this day
01:08:51 -  and upward, the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid consider it.
01:08:57 -  Is there a sense in which there's a foundation being laid today? In these considerations?
01:09:03 -  I think they're very foundational. Is the seed yet in the barn?
01:09:09 -  Yea, as yet the vine, the fig tree the pomegranate, the olive tree hath not brought forth, from this day
01:09:15 -  will I bless you. Thank you Lord. You just thought this was a conference or what did you think it was?
01:09:21 -  A retreat? You didn't know that God has chosen this
01:09:27 -  modest place in time to establish neglected foundations.
01:09:33 -  And if they're taken to heart and seen more than a series of meetings
01:09:39 -  but an event from God through one who is sent with a word sent given even on the spot
01:09:45 -  in your very sight and hearing and that you'll say yes to it then from that day
01:09:51 -  I will bless you. Though in previously I smote in verse 17 with blasting and with mildew
01:09:57 -  and with hail the labors of your hands but now from this day upward
01:10:03 -  from this day will I bless you. I will overthrow in verse 22
01:10:09 -  the thrones of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen. I will overthrow the chariots
01:10:15 -  and those that ride in them. The horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother.
01:10:21 -  They'll be their own judgment against each other. But in that day says the Lord of Hosts
01:10:27 -  will I take the old Zerubbabel who I believe is a precursor to Jesus himself
01:10:33 -  my servant son and will make thee as a signet
01:10:39 -  for I have chosen thee sayeth the Lord of Hosts. Here's a cryptic mystical hint of a latter day
01:10:45 -  fulfillment when when Zerubbabel could not conceivably be alive
01:10:51 -  there will be someone who is a governor of whom he is a type
01:10:57 -  and a shadow who will prevail in that day and be a sign
01:11:03 -  chosen in the blessing that will come to all the earth
01:11:09 -  when the house of the Lord is established in its foundations
01:11:15 -  and in its structure with every electric plate rightly aligned.
01:11:21 -  Shall we have a little prayer? What kind of prayer shall we have? Just a thank you Lord?
01:11:27 -  Or I'm hearing your voice and it's speaking to me
01:11:33 -  and it's compelling me to consider my ways and Lord I'm embarrassed
01:11:39 -  my ways have been somewhat shoddy my priorities have not been true
01:11:45 -  and absolute I'm taking this text as it applies to me and
01:11:51 -  yes you've blown upon much I brought home much but
01:11:57 -  you've made it little there's a wasting there's a lack of dew and moisture
01:12:03 -  the corn the new wine, the oil all of those great symbolic things
01:12:09 -  have been blighted the anointing, the oil has not been rich and full
01:12:15 -  the grain of God, the word of God has been inadequate we can sit through Sunday after Sunday
01:12:21 -  and never hear a living word but just predictable canned stuff there's a blight
01:12:27 -  there's no new wine so we have to produce and with hype
01:12:33 -  and bring people to a little soulish state of excitement but if we had the blessing of God
01:12:39 -  on the oil, the corn and the wine we would be overflowing and he will restore it
01:12:45 -  to the degree of taking his word seriously establishing the right priorities
01:12:51 -  not just in the particular but the whole mindset considering our ways
01:12:57 -  let's pray like that and you know what, that prayer will delight him it will please him
01:13:03 -  and in the end it will glorify him I'll begin and you follow Lord, who could have
01:13:09 -  imagined that this text would lend itself to such considerations
01:13:15 -  as you have put before us this morning you know that I know
01:13:21 -  that I had not a single thought of the kind I've heard coming out of my mouth since we've begun, you gave it on the spot
01:13:27 -  because when you send you said to Moses when he said who will go with me
01:13:33 -  I will send you and I will be with you the one who is sent is accompanied by the sender
01:13:39 -  and therefore that life is there to quicken and to
01:13:45 -  bring things that we had not considered that are life giving so Lord
01:13:51 -  we're living beneath this standard that you intend as normative and you died
01:13:57 -  to obtain for your church so come precious God, hear the
01:14:03 -  prayers of your saints appropriate prayers who are willing to receive
01:14:09 -  your correction, your adjustment that the foundations of your house be laid
01:14:15 -  for the ultimate end of it is peace, glory in Jesus name
01:14:21 -  just pray out of your seat
