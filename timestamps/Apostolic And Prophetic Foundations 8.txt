Apostolic And Prophetic Foundations 8

00:00 -  Okay, back to the text. Excuse my diversion. How does this chapter begin? It's not to do with Israel, but with the Son of Man.
00:20 -  The hand of Jehovah came upon him in order to bring him out in the spirit of the Lord and set him down in the midst of a valley full of bones. Why wasn't he there to begin with? Because who would choose it?
00:45 -  A valley is a place of depression. It's not the kind of thing that will attract us. So he rightly kept his distance and he had to be brought out of the place that he chose to occupy
01:13 -  that was comfortable for him spiritually and be brought down and into the midst of the dry bones in the valley. That's how the chapter begins. And that beginning should not be lost to us.
01:36 -  The valley is a depressing place, yes. Death is never pleasant, especially in the nation that we love. To see that nation in that condition, you want to avert your gaze.
01:56 -  We don't want to consider that death, let alone be brought down into the midst of it and be made to walk around the fullness of it. Right into our eyeballs, ready to our guts, the reality and the truth of death.
02:29 -  You need to stand up and do a little exercise. Are you okay? No man will ever speak for God who doesn't first see as God.
02:55 -  Prophets were called seers. What does that mean? They did not see as other men.
03:07 -  They saw as God. They see as God sees. They understand the situation as God sees it.
03:20 -  As it really in fact is, in truth and not as we would desire it to be. That's prophetic. No seeing, authentic seeing, which is a painful seeing, neither speaking for God.
03:50 -  The seeing precedes the speaking. And the prophet had to be brought down out in order to see it. Because he's a son of man and shrinks from unpleasant truth and doesn't want to see it.
04:14 -  And that's true of us all. Not just about Israel, about our churches, our marriages, our families, our nations. We want to see it in a better light.
04:32 -  More hopeful, more wishful. Who has the courage, the love for truth, that alone will keep us from deception. For the Lord warns us that he will abandon us to deception.
04:53 -  Except we love the truth. It's not enough just to respect it. We've got to love it.
05:03 -  And if you're not too experienced, I'll tell you. The truth is always painful before its glory. It's not a picnic.
05:18 -  The truth is painful if we would see things as God sees them. And be willing to be brought down and in to the midst of it. By the Spirit and the hand of God.
05:39 -  We are self-deceived. The whole world lives in the prince of darkness, the father of lies. The whole world abides in a lie.
06:00 -  It's phony. It's effective. To say the right thing.
06:09 -  The pleasant thing. The polite thing. And to shrink from the truth thing.
06:19 -  I plead with you. I beg you. Love the truth.
06:26 -  However painful it is. About yourself. The church.
06:34 -  The nation. The marriage. For we will not see the truth there.
06:42 -  How shall we expect to see it in Israel? This beginning is unspeakably significant. And it's not easy.
06:56 -  To be brought out of our categories. Our conventional understanding. Comfortable and familiar.
07:09 -  To be brought out. That we might be brought down. That we might be brought into.
07:19 -  The valley. The place of depression. Where the bones are.
07:25 -  Not Israel's condition as we would hope it should be. But as it in fact is. One of the indictments of the church in the book of Revelation.
07:47 -  You think you're rich. And have all things. But you're poor.
07:58 -  And naked. And you don't even know it. And the church is called to be prophetic.
08:08 -  And to be the prophetic presence of God within the nation. And speak to the nation the truth of its own condition. Not as it thinks itself to be.
08:26 -  But as it in fact is. But as it in fact is. And must be warned.
08:37 -  Look at chapter one of Isaiah. Hear O heaven and give ear O earth. For the Lord has spoken.
08:50 -  Why is the prophet addressing the dumb elements? Because men don't want to hear. Religious men.
09:05 -  Hear O heavens give ear O earth for the Lord has spoken. Then comes the indictment of Israel. I have nourished and brought up children, they rebelled against me.
09:20 -  The ox knows its owner, the ass its master's crib. But Israel. The chosen people of God.
09:30 -  The nation of priests. The light of the world. Does not know.
09:36 -  Israel no entiende. My people don't even consider. O sinful nation laden with iniquity.
09:47 -  Full of evildoers. Children of the raptures. They have forsaken the Lord.
09:53 -  They provoked to anger the holy one of Israel. They turned away backwards. The whole head is sick in verse five.
10:05 -  The whole heart faints. From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it. World bruises, putrefying sores.
10:17 -  That have not been closed or bound up or soothed with ointment. Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire.
10:29 -  Strangers devour your land in your presence. Death is overcome by strangers. The daughter of Zion is left as a shack in a village.
10:42 -  A wrecked miserable hut. A besieged city. And doesn't know it.
10:53 -  The prophet is speaking to Jerusalem. To the nation. At a time when it is prospering.
11:03 -  And what is being spoken. Is not the description of things as they see them. Where there is an external prosperity.
11:22 -  Where the sacrifices continue to be made every day by priests. Where the new moon and the Sabbath and the feast are being kept religiously. Which God says is an abomination.
11:39 -  But the prophet speaks the truth of their condition. As it one day soon will be. Who sees it as present reality.
11:52 -  And speaks the truth of their condition. While there is yet time to hear it. And to repent of it.
12:02 -  Before it becomes fulfilled in fact. This is prophetic seeing. Of what is already true.
12:12 -  That has not yet become apparent. But the eye of the prophet sees it. And as God sees it.
12:21 -  And that's what he speaks. Seeing has to proceed speaking. Are you ruthless in your seeing?
12:37 -  Do you see through appearances. Through the shallow and deceptive things. That would give the impression this is the best of all worlds.
12:48 -  Do you see what the real condition is. As God sees it. That needs to be identified.
12:57 -  For those who do not see. Before its judgment comes. It's not a welcome task.
13:06 -  Painful. The prophet and the apostle is nothing but a series of death. They prefer to be away.
13:15 -  That's why they have to be brought out and down. By the grace of God. By the grace of God.
13:24 -  By the grace of God. By the grace of God. By the Spirit of the Lord.
13:33 -  By the Spirit of the Lord. When they allow His hand to come upon them. He brought the Son of Man right into the valley.
13:42 -  And made him go all around. And it was full of bones. They were very dry.
13:51 -  And then God says to the man. Son of man. Son of man.
14:00 -  Can these bones live? Impossible. Impossible.
14:09 -  Even to prophetic faith. Let alone charismatic faith. The prophet could not bring himself to say, but of course.
14:18 -  The visible thing was stupefied. The visible thing was stupefied. The visible thing was stupefied.
14:27 -  This is facticity itself. This is facticity itself. I wish I had a dry bone to give you.
14:36 -  I wish I had a dry bone to give you. A really dry bone. And we would start here and pass it from hand to hand.
14:45 -  And we would start here and pass it from hand to hand. Right down and through the room. There might not be anything left to reach the first few.
14:54 -  There might not be anything left to reach the first few. Because when you handle a dry bone. It is so dry.
15:03 -  It decomposes. In your very hand. Becomes dust.
15:12 -  It's very dry. It's very dry. And of course it's very dead.
15:21 -  And you need to know that. That there's no hope for it. Except God.
15:30 -  Who raises the dead. By the word. That you will speak for him.
15:39 -  Stun a man, can these bones live? Know what we have to say? Beyond his own faith.
15:49 -  Charismatic faith will not suffice. Charismatic faith will not suffice. Prophetic faith will not suffice.
15:58 -  What kind then? The faith of the son of God himself. The faith of the son of God himself.
16:07 -  Have you ever come to his faith? Have you ever come to his faith? Have you been brought to places beyond your own faith?
16:16 -  That's ultimate faith and true faith. That's ultimate faith and true faith. And it shall not fail.
16:25 -  And few of us have ever touched it. We're still at another place and another level. Functioning and serving out of ourselves.
16:34 -  Functioning and serving out of ourselves. Acceptably. Even admirably.
16:43 -  For the situations we've had to face till now. But we're coming to an ultimate situation. But we're coming to an ultimate situation.
16:52 -  Where that will not suffice. And God is the creator of that situation. Not only for Israel's sake.
17:01 -  But for our sake. For we shall not exceed eternally. In the realm of heaven.
17:10 -  In the realm of heaven. Any place or position that we have not obtained in this life. Any place or position that we have not obtained in this life.
17:19 -  Are you ready to go to the Lord now? In this condition that you are? If it will be fixed?
17:29 -  In that place? In that place? In that place?
17:38 -  Eternally? Oh, you thought heaven was democratic? We're all going to heaven?
17:47 -  One place, one status, one condition? You think that we're all going to be around the throne of heaven? Who can bear that light?
17:56 -  Who can bear that light? Hell and everlasting darkness is a mercy! And everlasting darkness is a mercy!
18:05 -  Mercy. To those who are not accustomed to the light. To those who are not accustomed to the light.
18:14 -  And have preferred darkness. And have preferred darkness. This is a graduated thing.
18:23 -  This is a graduated thing. We're not in the same place now? And we'll not be in the same place then?
18:32 -  But then it will be fixed. And eternal. We will have a reward.
18:41 -  Proportionate to our works. In this life. And to the quality and the depth of the faith.
18:50 -  And the knowledge of him. And the love of truth and light. It's a mercy.
19:00 -  That the Lord does not come now. And take us now. We would be eternally mortified.
19:09 -  And ashamed. So here's what I want you to know. The crisis of Israel.
19:18 -  Is for your sake. Is for your sake. It compels you to be a saint.
19:31 -  It compels you to have an authentic faith. It will not let you buy with shallow credos. It's got to be an authentic faith.
19:47 -  And a faith that works by love. Or it will not work at all. None of this shabby sentimental stuff.
20:00 -  Oh brother, I really love the Jews. I love Israel. Sentimentally.
20:12 -  It evokes certain pleasant images for me. More imagined than real. That so-called love will go up like a puff.
20:24 -  When Israel disappoints you. The love of God is never disappointed. It's an unconditional love.
20:36 -  That cannot be offended against. I know you only too well. I know that some of you esteem me.
20:48 -  You've been blessed in these days. The Lord has touched you. But let me miss it once.
20:57 -  Once. One failed sermon. One questionable reference.
21:07 -  One comment about the organ player. And the whole esteem can come down in a moment. Like a nose dive.
21:22 -  Because it's conditional. So long as I perform. Impressively.
21:31 -  But let there come a moment of disappointment. Finished. That's not God.
21:46 -  Can you imagine? How far God will go. Who knows what eternity really means.
21:55 -  And what is fixed and absolute. And what is unchanging there. There's no redemptive possibilities there.
22:07 -  So far as I imagine. And it's safer not to imagine that. That puts all the emphasis on this life.
22:18 -  And It's greater. More than it is. That puts all the emphasis on this life.
22:31 -  This life. This time. These realities.
22:37 -  Is the format. Is the redemptive matrix. By which we are being shaped for eternity.
22:49 -  It's not a taking of a test to get a grade. It's yet another opportunity. A God given occasion.
23:01 -  To develop something. Bring us to something. That will enhance our eternal life.
23:12 -  Who will rule and reign with him. Forever. He says some will be given five cities.
23:22 -  Some ten. Whatever that means this much is clear. It's relative.
23:30 -  We don't all get the same thing. We don't all do the same thing. Some of us will have a more honored place.
23:39 -  More significant. More eternally gratified. Whatever the cost of that.
23:48 -  In this life. Whatever the humiliations. Whatever the suffering.
23:56 -  That fitted us for that place. For eternity. We will have said it was worth while.
24:05 -  We're apostolic. We're prophetic. What does that mean?
24:13 -  That we live in the present. With the deepest consciousness of eternal reality. With the deepest consciousness of eternal reality.
24:22 -  We bring the eternal thing into the present. We bring the eternal thing into the present. And it heightens every issue of life.
24:31 -  And it heightens every issue of life. It radicalizes it. It changes it.
24:40 -  It allows us to be even more crazy. It allows us to be even more crazy. We would otherwise not be.
24:49 -  We would otherwise not be. It enables you to be cruel before you can be kind. It enables you to be cruel before you can be kind.
24:58 -  That's from Shakespeare. The play Hamlet. Maybe the greatest tragedy ever written.
25:07 -  You have an obligation to study it. You have an obligation to study it. You know the story?
25:16 -  Hamlet was a prince. In Denmark. And his father was killed while he was away.
25:25 -  And his father was killed while he was away. By his own ambitious brother. Who marries the widow.
25:34 -  By his own ambitious brother. Who marries the widow. By his own ambitious brother. And there comes a moment when Hamlet
25:43 -  has revealed to him what had taken place. And there comes a moment when Hamlet has revealed to him what had taken place. His own mother
25:52 -  His own mother was an unconscious participant was an unconscious participant
26:01 -  a scummy ambitious brother could appropriate his kingdom could appropriate his kingdom
26:10 -  and marry his own queen. What should a son do about that? That's where Hamlet speaks the great lines.
26:19 -  That's where Hamlet speaks the great lines. To be or not to be. That is the question.
26:28 -  Because the man is even contemplating suicide. To be or not to be. To suffer the swings of outrageous fortune.
26:37 -  To suffer the swings of outrageous fortune. Next to the Bible. Next to the Bible.
26:46 -  I don't know a greater literature. And I'm saying all that's to say this. One scene.
26:55 -  Where the son confronts the mother. This silly, shallow, sensual woman. This silly, shallow, sensual woman.
27:04 -  Whom he accuses of lying between incestuous sheets. Whom he accuses of lying
27:13 -  between incestuous sheets. And she's wearing a locket around her throat. A locket.
27:23 -  That opens up to two pictures. The husband that was. The husband that is.
27:34 -  No comparison. The first was noble. A man of stature.
27:43 -  A giant in righteousness. The other one scummy. And Hamlet takes his mother's locket
27:53 -  and opens it. And pushes it right in her face. So much as to say,
28:02 -  look at what you've chosen. And the truth breaks upon her. Painfully.
28:11 -  And she can't bear to see it. And she cries out in the most pathetic way. Your heart to hear it.
28:20 -  Your sympathy immediately goes out. To this poor woman. Hamlet, no more.
28:29 -  Then Shakespeare puts these words in Hamlet's mouth. Then Shakespeare puts these words in Hamlet's mouth. Sometimes he says,
28:38 -  one must be cruel in order to be kind. I wish I had a peso.
28:50 -  For every time I've had to be cruel in order to be kind.
28:59 -  One occasion came very recently. When a nice Christian woman came up to me wanting me to answer a question,
29:08 -  but I first had to listen to long details and I was exhausted standing on my feet
29:17 -  taking valuable time to hear the whole background until I finally had to say,
29:26 -  what's the question? Well she finally asked me the question that the Lord gives her things to say
29:35 -  but she somehow is not able to say them. Evidently fear of man. The problem that afflicts us all.
29:45 -  So I said, you know, that's only the symptom. The fear of man is only the symptom
29:54 -  of a much deeper condition. Of a self-life that doesn't want to offend.
30:03 -  That needs to be acknowledged and gratified. You know what I think your answer is?
30:12 -  The cross. Not just against the fear of man but the self-wife itself.
30:21 -  That's the good news. That's the deliverance, that's the freedom. Because I perceive that your problem
30:30 -  is more than the fear of man. It's an egotism which was even revealed
30:39 -  in your willingness to take my time to weary me with all the unnecessary details.
30:51 -  Was that necessary problem? Wasn't that a bit harsh? Even cruel?
31:01 -  How far will we go? If we know the time is short and eternity is at stake.
31:10 -  Sometimes, it's not an everyday thing. But don't withhold yourself when it comes.
31:19 -  When the Lord wants to speak that way. When one must speak that way. When one must speak that way.
31:28 -  When one must be cruel in order to be kind. Or else when the final moment comes
31:37 -  to speak to the bones as you are commanded. You will not be able.
31:46 -  I prophesied as I was commanded. So I prophesied as I was commanded. I prophesied as I was commanded.
32:15 -  What a beautiful statement. The Lord commands the proper prophesies. Not what he would like to speak
32:24 -  but what he's commanded to speak. What if he was not in the mood? What if it was an off day?
32:36 -  He didn't feel particularly spiritual. Lord, come back and try me another time. It's like us.
32:45 -  Are you coming to the service? I don't know if I feel like it. That's at least what they say in North America.
32:54 -  Because it doesn't happen here. I'm amazed how much the conduct of believers,
33:03 -  serious believers, is predicated on feeling. I don't know if I feel like coming.
33:12 -  If I feel, the Lord commanded the prophet prophesied.
33:21 -  Because it was the consistent pattern of his life. Are you accustomed to that?
33:30 -  To being commanded to be commanded to being commanded
33:39 -  and obeying instantly without qualification or condition
33:48 -  or question. That's something that we like. Oh, I've been through the furnace.
34:00 -  Living in poverty. Chosen. In northern Minnesota,
34:09 -  40 below zero. We didn't have adequate housing. Pregnant women.
34:22 -  Inadequate food. Living beneath the poverty level established by the United States government.
34:33 -  And somebody sent us a check for $5,000. And somebody sent us a check for $5,000. Glory to God.
34:42 -  We had made no public acknowledgement of our needs. Came of itself from God. That came from God.
34:51 -  My mind was ticking of how it's to be spent. Housing, food, shelter, clothing. House, food, cover, dress.
35:00 -  And we were celebrating before God. And Friday was our fast day. Prayer for Israel.
35:09 -  And why we were together rejoicing. The Lord whispered to me in an ever so small voice.
35:18 -  Art. You know that $5,000 check you got? Send it to such and such a
35:27 -  couple in Israel. Who are in ministry there. Who have a brand new Volvo.
35:36 -  Leather jackets. Who live in a lovely apartment. Have exquisite musical instruments.
35:45 -  Send it to them. I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
35:55 -  I cleared my throat. I said, excuse me. Saints.
36:04 -  But as I was sitting here. I hope I'm wrong. But I think I heard
36:13 -  the still small voice of God. That said, send the check that you've just received.
36:22 -  That you're already spending in your mind. To this couple in ministry in Israel.
36:31 -  Who don't begin to have your needs. It was like a man taking the pin out of a hand grenade.
36:40 -  And rolling it down the middle of the aisle. The shrapnel was everywhere.
36:49 -  The shrapnel was everywhere. The shrieks, the cries. The anger.
36:58 -  The hatred. I could not believe that saints were capable of it.
37:10 -  And I was the leader. And the founder. And the principal elder.
37:19 -  But then all of a sudden people began to question about my marriage.
37:28 -  It's not all that good. Now that we think about it. And you're failing your children.
37:37 -  Your condition is all that much to be desired. Are you really qualified to be an elder?
37:47 -  Do you have your house in order? They were challenging the authority. Hoping to find some
37:56 -  contradiction. That would absolve them from the responsibility of obeying.
38:05 -  When God had given the head to that body. And it broke loose.
38:14 -  A demonstration of rebellion. Selfishness. Self-will.
38:23 -  That was always there. But never would have been revealed. If we were not living together
38:32 -  from the same income that God had given. I could be wrong.
38:41 -  The fact that I've had 15, 20, 25 years of experience being led by the Spirit.
38:50 -  That's no guarantee of anything. You can always be wrong. I hope I am.
38:59 -  We're in a fast day today. Let's go out into the woods. Let's find a quiet place.
39:08 -  Seek the Lord. There's after all only one God. He has only one mind.
39:17 -  One will. He's not a series of contradictions. Let's find what the will of God is.
39:26 -  And He'll give it to us together. And then we'll know. It was worse at night than it was at the morning.
39:36 -  I never heard so many scriptures quoted. Each one to defend his own position. If you don't provide for your own
39:45 -  you're worse than an infidel. I thought this was it. We're finished.
39:54 -  Where's the unity of the body of Christ? It was a jungle. It was a jungle.
40:03 -  And these were not your everyday Christians. These are people that have left their comfortable homes.
40:12 -  And their businesses for the love of Christ and their identification with the cross
40:21 -  to come up as community in that remote place. And they were coming apart at the seams.
40:30 -  What could we hope for then in ordinary sin? What a revelation
40:39 -  of the truth of the condition of the Church as it in fact is and needs to be recognized
40:48 -  acknowledged He's a God of truth. He'll be cruel in order to be kind.
40:58 -  He's not going to pamper us in our self-perception. But when we will acknowledge the truth of our condition
41:07 -  we'll experience His grace and His mercy. What happened that day, brother?
41:16 -  Well, we had a young Jewish believer with pimples awkward as all get out
41:26 -  the kind that only a mother could love. I had brought him from New York myself and as a student
41:35 -  he didn't even have his own bed. He used to rotate the use of his bed with two other students.
41:44 -  Talk about God taking beggars off of dung hills. Young in the faith immature
41:53 -  high-pitched crack voice and we had come to a logic. It was an insoluble dilemma
42:05 -  threatening the whole continuation of our life and in that terrible act
42:14 -  where you stop breathing in unspeakable pain where there is no pain greater
42:23 -  than that which we experience in the Church. The Church is not given
42:32 -  for our enjoyment it's given for our suffering to prepare us for eternity.
42:41 -  This brother spoke up. Well, he said I don't profess to hear
42:50 -  what brother Art says he has heard but I say that if he thinks that he heard from God
42:59 -  we have an obligation to go with him because God has put him as the head of this body
43:08 -  and I think that we need to believe that that was God. Silencio
43:17 -  quiet God had spoken unmistakably
43:26 -  and authoritatively through the weakest youngest member
43:35 -  of the body. We'll never forget it. We didn't walk out of that room that night
43:44 -  we were off the ground it was heavenly it was joy unspeakable
43:53 -  because we were willing to bear the pain and the suffering of the Church
44:02 -  in rebellion and self-will in the truth of its condition. Why did I tell you that?
44:14 -  I forgot the point. How far God will go if we will allow him
44:28 -  to prepare us for eternity and the faith which is the faith that will yet be required
44:37 -  to express or Israel remains in her death and the Lord does not come
44:46 -  nor his kingdom to the nations. This is the faith saints
44:55 -  there's a cross at the heart of it come on let's get real
45:05 -  the time is short we have a call only us
45:14 -  not given to any other a son of man company a corporate reality
45:23 -  through and through the whole body that can be commanded the moment that God chooses
45:32 -  to obtain obedience to raise the dead you like being commanded?
45:45 -  let me pray for you Lord, who likes it? we'll question the authority of that one who commands
45:54 -  if the command is not pleasant to us if it threatens our self-interest we'll find some way to absolve ourselves
46:03 -  from the obligation to obey it we're not habituated to obedience
46:12 -  we're self-willed we don't like to be told we don't like to be commanded
46:21 -  we don't like to be commanded but we're asking you to deal with that and lay the axe to the root
46:30 -  that you might have a son of man whom you can command to an immediate and total obedience
46:39 -  the moment of your choosing without hesitation because it is the final son
46:48 -  because it is the final sum of all of his obedience as it will be ours
