Sorrow and Anguish

00:00 -  Good evening dear saints, we prayed tonight that the Lord would give us an incarnational miracle because of the subtlety and delicacy of the theme that I believe he wants to set before us that unless he gives it there will be a clumsy human performance however good our intention
00:30 -  so I'm asking you to prepare your spirit agreeing with me in prayer now that you'll be very attentive quiet in the inner man and follow along as the Lord unfolds something that could be more critical than we can imagine certainly ultimate without the acquisition of which
00:52 -  the fullness of the Gentiles will not become in and yet it's in the range of emotion sensibility I don't have a word for temperament you would think it's a minor note but it's a note that we need to obtain and so I'm asking Lord not only will you set it before us
01:18 -  as something to be desired but as something to be obtained that in fact the word itself will perform the work it will set in motion the reality even for those who may have never known it and who have been incapacitated so to speak by culture or race or ethnic origin or history to exhibit
01:42 -  and to know and to move in this range of emotion and yet we would be incomplete without it because it's essential to your own nature you're not some this what's the word antiseptic God you're a feeling God and all our our afflictions you have been afflicted you're a man of sorrows
02:09 -  not just you were a man of sorrows you are a man of sorrows you're acquainted with grief there's something in your holy disposition that lends itself to aching and commiseration and identification with suffering that's what the word compassion means suffering with so Lord how shall
02:30 -  we be your people and not be like you and not have the same propensity the same disposition especially where it is least expected to be expressed with the people Israel because they repel and they invite criticism and rejection rather than sympathetic and merciful consideration
02:56 -  so Lord we're asking for something tonight that you've asked us to ask I didn't make this up you don't know where it came and when it came that Psalm 102 is tonight's text that there's something for which you're waiting not in Israel but in the church
03:15 -  a set time to favor Zion comes when your servants have compassion upon her stones mercy upon her dust a certain attitude toward Israel at a certain time in her history and when that sign comes the deliverer comes out of Zion he's waiting for a release that comes to him through something that
03:41 -  takes place with his servants which is not a reference to Israel for if they were not if they were his servants they would not be needing compassion so we bless you Lord come and more than instruct us deal with us break us up in the deeps we're too dry-eyed we're too clinical
04:02 -  we're too Chinese we're too analytical we need something my God to break us up and bring us onto that hebraic prophetic ground of commiseration of sympathy of compassion of what you are in your own nature so we're asking that Lord to work tonight from which we will never recover
04:24 -  will be different there'll be a new disposition and you'll be delighted for it you'll rejoice for it and that many will be the beneficiary who are not Jews so we thank you give you praise Lord come only you can perform this we look to you thank you and give you the praise that it's in
04:43 -  your heart my God to to deal with us in this way you're not letting us go you're so jealous you're probing and reaching deep and we appreciate that and we welcome the full work in Jesus name amen psalm 102 an eschatological psalm what does that mean cats
05:05 -  it means a psalm pertaining to the end written in the time of David what a phenomenon that the composer of this psalm i don't know if it does it say David if not someone Davidic anticipated and foresaw a condition that has not yet taken place in time it is yet future
05:31 -  it's eschatological and the conclusion of it as we hope to see tonight is glorious it begins with a cry of distress by someone in a concentration camp now do you know what a concentration camp is it's not where you concentrate
05:54 -  i don't know where you are you know what what your newspapers reveal you know the word Auschwitz yeah camp of annihilation of systematic annihilation which i have been privileged to visit in fact i have visited virtually every concentration camp and every place of annihilation
06:15 -  that exists in europe whenever i have opportunity and this one Auschwitz in Poland and the one three kilometers away that is more new Birkenau is a factory of annihilation for acres and acres and acres all you see are the foundations of the former barracks that housed these desperate
06:40 -  victims who were systematically gassed the nazis even blew up the gas ovens and the factory of annihilation itself before the onrush of the russians at the end of the war and we looked out in this vast field
06:57 -  of systematic annihilation and the brother who is with me said art if you believe that there's coming a time of tribulation that will exceed the nazi time that took six million jewish lives in the space of 1941 through 45 how can two-thirds of present world jewelry be annihilated
07:23 -  in a space of time less than that without factories of annihilation like this i said you know i have never thought of it but you're right there's got to be some kind of remarkable provision for the systematic annihilation of numbers of that kind
07:45 -  and here we have in this psalm future a description of just such a place hear my prayer oh lord and let my cry come before thee hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble and climb thy ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily for my days are
08:05 -  consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as in a hearth my heart is smitten and withered like grass or i forget to eat my bread by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin have you seen pictures of the concentration camp inmates they were living skeletons
08:27 -  i'm like a pelican of the wilderness i'm like an owl of the desert i watch and i'm as a sparrow alone upon the housetop my enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad rage against me are sworn against me for i have eaten ashes like bread and
08:44 -  mingled my drink like weeping verse eight indicates imprisonment and intimidation and suffering daily scathing attack by people who despise the captured victim and are mad enrage against him and sworn against me i've eaten ashes like bread mingled
09:06 -  my drink with weeping because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou has lifted me up and cast me down my days are like a shadow that decline and i'm wizard like grass but thou oh lord shall endure forever and thy remembrance unto all generations thou shalt arise and have mercy
09:25 -  upon zion for the time to favor her yea the set time has come for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof let's stop there this is a remarkable statement of a man who is imprisoned and is brought to a new kind of consciousness that is yet lacking
09:50 -  among jews and maybe it's going to take imprisonment and trial and the various things that are described here to bring jewish consciousness to an awareness that this is not happenstance this is not we're victims because of a hitler or because of this or because of that
10:09 -  God has cast me down God has cast me out this is the statement of your indignation i'm deserving what i'm experiencing but i'm acknowledging that you are the author of it and i'll tell you when jews will come to that kind of consciousness they're at the threshold and the door of salvation
10:27 -  and if it takes extremity to bring us to such consciousness it's worth it you have cast me out because of your indignation in verse 10 your wrath you have lifted me up and cast me down i'm deserving what i'm suffering but i'm still crying out for a mercy because unless it comes
10:47 -  from you i'm dead i'm finished you but you oh lord shall endure forever in verse 12 i may pass i wither like grass i'm a shadow but you oh lord shall endure forever notice the shift from me to you i'm i'm like grass i wither but you oh lord what a precious oh i can't tell you
11:12 -  dear saints i came into ministry as a missionary to the jews how i long and ache for a day in which any measure of my kinsman will begin to speak like this i yes i wither but you oh lord you endure a new consciousness of concern for the lord over and above that eclipses me is already
11:36 -  a man at the threshold of salvation and if it takes us that extremity to obtain this praise God and then what a remarkable a sense of God thou shalt arise you're not going to let it leave us in this condition permanently you shall have arise
11:56 -  but when will you arise and have mercy upon zion when the time to favor her the set time is come oh focus on that saints there's something in the deliberation of God and the wisdom of God and the timing of God an event for which he waits to bring a release he's he's what's he's contained himself
12:19 -  he's imposed upon himself a restriction he'll not move he'll not be a deliverer that comes out of zion and take transgression from jacob until the set time to favor her has come you guys believe in set times we're in a set time right now this is a set time God has established this time and the
12:41 -  church needs to come into a consciousness that one day is not like another that God has set times there's a design there's a conscious unfolding of the extraordinary will of God that includes us we're not just floating from occasion to occasion in some kind of aimless way there's a deliberation
13:03 -  from the throne of heaven we're moving towards something we're moving toward an end we're moving toward a climax we're moving toward a consummation and because we are aware of that it makes our everyday more significant we're not just a drift there's a set time we're in a set time now that has
13:22 -  come what's the set time for which the lord waits how will he recognize it when it comes in verse 14 for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof well who are the servants why doesn't the text say the church because in the time of its composition
13:46 -  the word didn't exist it would not have made any kind of sense but the word servants is indicative of the church and is a word that's appropriate and timeless it's not something that happens to Israel for which God is waiting it's something that happens to his servants what is the something
14:07 -  what is the something it's attitudinal it's not something they do it's something that they are that they manifest a compassion for stones and a pity for dust what kind of silly stuff is this what is God waiting for a special respect for antiquity and for archaeology what stones and
14:29 -  dust as you're waiting for the servants to have compassion over the stones and dust of rubble of the cities that have been devastated in Israel jerusalem and hypha tel aviv tiberias devastated nothing but rubble and ruin as we learned in isaiah 6 and in other texts
14:52 -  when the land is made desolate and its people are cast far away the statement of rubble and ruin is prophetic and psalmist terminology for the devastation of judgment that has come upon the people and upon the land i'll tell you what at that time historically mind my words
15:13 -  the world will be celebrating there'll be a rejoicing they'll be rubbing hands in glee those jews are getting what they deserve but in the midst of a world that takes delight in Israel's pathetic dilemma there's a strange minority to be found here and there in the nations
15:36 -  that do not join them they don't take any glee and delight in the judgment that has come upon that nation deservedly to bring it to ruin instead they identify to say that they have compassion on the stones and mercy on its dust is a statement of identification with the people
15:59 -  in their reduced and pathetic condition and not just from a distance and not just some kind of easy and cheap acknowledgement but identification of this kind is costly it requires a participation not just an acknowledgement this is the deepest deepest thing and we don't yet have it and we're
16:25 -  not yet there and if we miss this the deliver does not come out of science he's not waiting for anything other any other sign the set time to favor Israel is waiting on a particular expression from a particular people and most of us even tonight are incapacitated to give it
16:49 -  for all of the fervency of your prayer i don't think i've yet seen the tear we're too dry-eyed and evidently it's not a trite thing it's not some cheap sentimental or emotional thing because to identify with Israel in the time of her greatest extremity
17:09 -  and judgment and suffering knowing that it's deserved by her sin and yet not for that reason keeping ourselves at a spiritual distance and saying tough on you but identifying with her in her sin though we ourselves don't share in that sin we're walking holy but we identify
17:31 -  with the nation in her condition in exactly the same way as Jesus entered the waters of jordan for baptism and stupefied john the baptist and said what are you doing here i'm here to fulfill all righteousness i'm entering these waters in identification with my people's sin though i
17:51 -  myself am sinless i could stood on i could have stood on the back bank and looked at them going down and to be their messiah with a certain kind of respect but no i've got to join them i've got to identify with them and the same with that daniel identified with with the plight and the
18:12 -  sin of his people we have sinned daniel says and God says daniel is a man after my own heart we heard your prayer from the first because of your identification with with your nation in its sin this is uh brings us into a whole new area of consideration long overdue sorrow
18:40 -  tragic sense of life i'm going to be going into germany on this trip and seeing german students at a certain university who found us on our website when i finally came to them a year or so ago late crunched riding the back of a car from holland arriving late the meeting already
19:01 -  started i came into the room they looked me over i sat down they went through their charismatic choruses and then they looked to me to begin speaking i opened my mouth and i said i perceive you lack a tragic sense of life they didn't know what i was talking about
19:23 -  and i didn't know what i was talking about either it wasn't my thought it was the lord's thought but it was a true thought they're german students but they bear no reflection of their own history they do not exhibit an iota of anything through which their own nation has passed
19:41 -  being the engine of annihilation of six million jews in their recent history it's as if it had not happened what is it about history by which such events are swept under the carpet and soon enough forgotten and a whole new generation raised up as if it has nothing to do with them
20:00 -  listen dear saints it's very becoming and appropriate for the church especially to have a tragic sense of life life is tragic the requirement that God had to crucify his own son is a tragic requirement necessitated by the guilt and sin of mankind there's tragedy everywhere
20:25 -  there's incest there's rape there's terrible misuse and brutalizing of men and women and children they're forced in africa into bearing arms at the age of nine ten twelve and they've got to kill to prove their their their loyalty to the people who have compelled them to become
20:43 -  soldiers as children we have in our generation children having children there's a whole devastation of mankind there's a massive genocide taking place in the earth black people in america seven out of every ten black males will be in prison before they're 21 violence and suicide
21:04 -  is high among youth throughout the world and especially in the west this is a tragic world their saints people are dying and broken and contorted and distorted we have no sense of that so that's the reason why the lord is a man of sorrows he's the all-seeing God
21:25 -  who sees what is being inflicted upon those who are made in his image and it's a permanent disposition in the lord's own divine personality but it's lacking in ours a man of sorrow acquainted with grief how did Paul begin in roman's nine shared the other day i speak the truth in christ
21:48 -  i'm not lying my conscience confirms in the holy spirit i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart for i would wish myself accursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my brethren the people of Israel i have great sorrow and increasing unceasing anguish of heart he
22:12 -  doesn't have it because he's jewish he has it because he's apostolic he has it because of his affinity and union with the heart of the high priest and the chief apostle of our faith that means that we're not exempt we're not absolved from grief or sorrow of a comparable kind
22:34 -  it has not to do with whether we're jewish or not it has to do with what degree are we in apostolic union with the apostle and high priest of our faith because he has unceasing anguish of heart and and sorrow that we don't have it and are indifferent and merely clinically correct
22:55 -  about the subject is the statement of the distance that yet exists between ourselves and him in terms of actual union that's why he's waiting for our compassion and for our mercy because when it comes the union has come and will come historically at a time when
23:16 -  the world will be stupefied by such a phenomenon that gentiles in malaysia are broken-hearted and grieving and identified with Israel's collapse the terrible debacle of its great cities toppling its trade towers reduced to rubble and to ruin where all the world is celebrating and rejoicing
23:41 -  the plight of the jews and saying that is overdue and they deserve it because there's a deep resentment to the gentile heart worldwide against this people they will gloat and and and rejoice for the destruction for which you will lament you'll be very strange you'll be a stranger pilgrim
24:02 -  and a sojourner in the earth just to be distinguished by your identification with a hated people suffering their judgments but it says in verse 15 remarkably so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory when the lord shall build
24:22 -  up zion he shall appear in his glory what is that that this phenomenon has something to do with the completion of the church symbolically called here zion and that is of so formidable and visible a kind that the world is required to take note of it
24:46 -  it's a visible phenomenon that is so contrary to the spirit and the ethos of the age that hates the jew that the jew hating nations have got to say what is this what kind of gentiles are these that have such an affinity such a love such a compassion for a hated and despised people
25:05 -  who are suffering what they deserve it's a revelation of something that is the glory of God in his zion it's the it's the consummating thing that reveals the glory of zion without it it's not yet complete the lord shall appear in his glory he'll be made visible how shall i say it there's
25:29 -  a realization of the fullness of the lord when his church comes to be in agreement with him who is compassionate and full of mercy because what is mercy if it's deserved mercy is not something given because the recipient deserves it mercy is given because the one who
25:48 -  gives it is expressing what he is in himself in his own nature you should have heard me pray in the room before coming out something like lord i thank you for your remarkable patience and forbearance with my people we have cost you such fits we have blasphemed your name in every nation
26:10 -  where you have driven us our track record stinks we're corrupt yet your patience your mercy your kindness you love you should have blotted us out long ago from every consideration that you have retained us and preserved us and yet have a destiny for us of of an exalted kind above all
26:31 -  nations is a remarkable statement not about us but about you we have given you an opportunity through our apostasy and unbelief and rebellion to show what you are as a God of mercy for you will have mercy upon whom you will have mercy because mercy is what you are but will your
26:53 -  people have it and when they will the lord shall appear and be the deliverer of Israel for he comes out of that zion and that zion alone he shall build up zion and appear in his glory because his glory is his mercy his glory is his compassion his glory is what he is in himself in his own
27:15 -  nature and character can you imagine that God should have a people who are only clinically correct tearless and dry-eyed hard-hearted only mental only arithmetical and not have a nature like unto his where then is the bride for the bridegroom having the glory of God adorned for
27:43 -  the bridegroom that is to say having a nature compatible with his when is that to come and how are we to attain it that's the set time to favor zion is it remarkable that you could be the key in malaysia to the lord coming out of zion to deliver Israel and take from her transgression
28:08 -  though you're distant from the operation wherever it takes place he waits for the sign and the signal that issues from you where you are to be the key to his release to perform it we're in something together saints that's why i'm here that's why Paul sent why God sent Paul to
28:28 -  the gentiles because it's the gentile the church that humanly considered would never be an agent for compassion for jews it's a paradox it's not to be understood as a that it could be performed that divides what is natural the only way it can take place is by a grace given of God forming his
28:53 -  person in us his disposition in us giving us the kind of heart that he has because left to ourselves we're chinese all too chinese too clinical too matter of fact too hard-hearted too unwilling to break and cry because of saving of face and the various other
29:12 -  things in which we have been steeped and brought up in the long history of our tradition it's unnatural for us to have compassion over dust and mercy over stones exactly right but we're not called to what is natural we're called to what is supernatural what shall we
29:33 -  have it if we don't seek it if we don't desire it if we don't see it as a high and even an ultimate value if we don't or we're not chafed in our inner man for being so tearless so matter of fact so mechanical so correct in a clinical way that i couldn't even give a hug to my malaysian
29:54 -  chinese doctor before i left she could only timidly offer me her hand in a handshake i wanted to take the little thing up and give her a bone crushing hug but no her malaysian chinese thing insulated her matter of fact i've never seen a more impersonal woman
30:13 -  only the details of my health nothing else where does she get that mentality how deep is it what will it take to break into the into the heart of a woman like that that she might be opened for a transcendent reality after which she's now presently closed so he will regard the prayer
30:35 -  verse 17 of the destitute and not despise their prayer i don't know if that is speaking about the man who's crying out from the concentration camp or the believer who is crying out compassionately from wherever he is for the plight of Israel with which he's identified both prayers will be
30:52 -  destitute it's destitute because we're identified with the destitute people we pray from their place of destitution and not from our place of superiority we're one with them in their terrible plight as Jesus was one with Israel coming into the waters of baptism as if he were himself a sinner
31:13 -  that fulfills all righteousness this being impersonal standing on the bank and looking down at the plight of others is not identification it's keeping one at a safe distance to be compassionate is suffer with identify with
31:33 -  be in their plight in their circumstance but he'll regard the prayer thus shall be written for the generation to come the people who shall be created shall praise the lord for he have looked down from the height of a sanctuary from heaven the lord beheld the earth to hear the groaning
31:51 -  of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in druslim when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord now your dear bible students isn't it about time that you're reading carefully
32:10 -  and seeing the conclusion of the matter in every text that we have considered almost without exception the end is a reference always to the nations Israel's restoration to deliver coming out of zion to take transgression from jacob is not only Israel's deliverance it's the world
32:29 -  salvation the nations will behold the nations will see the nations will recognize when God has sanctified Israel in their midst and here we have yet another clear statement when the nations the peoples the goyim are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord this is the ultimate
32:54 -  cosmic triumph of God over creation but what did it take to obtain it a final stroke of a strangest kind a demonstration from the people called servants who have no natural reason to regard Israel in judgment compassionately and yet they do it
33:19 -  not out of an obligation because out of a union with the God himself who is mercy and so visible in real a way that it completes zion that it releases the deliverer and that the world takes note that something of a remarkable kind has happened that compels their acknowledgement
33:41 -  of this God and the serving of his kingdom this is cryptic this is terse this is compact we're not given long poetic odes to explain what we're now saying it's very brief but we dare not miss it the issue of Israel is the issue of the nations i say it again and again and again and again
34:04 -  and this is the key to the nations and the kingdoms serving the God who is God this breaks the last back of resistance the last opposition the last argument about who God is because if this can happen in the earth with gentiles favoring a despised people in a very real compassion of
34:28 -  identification that may well be costly then God is God there's no natural way to explain a phenomenon of this kind this is the final straw that breaks the camel's back that even the nations are obliged to acknowledge and to turn when the people are gathered together well in isaiah chapter
34:51 -  66 there's another expression that is completely in keeping with the compassion and mercy that we're talking about that this is not some just cheap emotional or sentimental statement it's a real identification calls for something real something costly that's called
35:16 -  travail anguish of soul wrestling before God pouring out your soul in bitter tears stretched out on the fourth and verse 7 of chapter 66 the last chapter of the great book of isaiah well verse 6 a voice of noise from the city a voice in the temple a voice of the lord
35:40 -  that renders recompense to his enemies then before she prevailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child who has heard such a thing who has seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for
35:57 -  as soon as zion prevailed the same zion of which we just read in psalm 102 where the glory of God is perfected and made manifest as soon as that zion travails which is the same as the servants these are all symbolic terms referring to the same entity the church as soon as zion
36:20 -  prevails she brought forth her children shall i bring to birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy God rejoice ye with Jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for
36:37 -  her mourning and sorrow and travail are all of one peace travailing in birth for a nation that is incapacitated to bring forth herself in a day a new nation and will not be birthed except someone else volunteer for the pangs and the travail of birth for another
37:04 -  what's the mystery for which God created all things in order through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be demonstrated or principalized in brazil here this what's the wisdom a church willing to agonize willing to travail willing to bear the pangs of birth for
37:22 -  a nation that is so depleted and so destitute and so out that they're incapable of being birthed as the Israel of God unless you bear the pain of it unless you bear the anguish of it unless you travail in your own soul and cry out before God for the coming forth of that nation in a day
37:42 -  have you ever heard of a woman willing to bear the birth pangs for another whose child and it is not her own it's it's unnatural who would volunteer except a strange people called servants full of compassion mercy sorrow anguish of soul
38:02 -  waiting and participating not just from a distance but somehow in their identification and a travail that is deep brings forth the thing that would not otherwise have been attained you are the issue you are the key you you servants you zion it's not Israel Israel's out of the
38:27 -  picture they're down and out if you fail if you have not the ability at the disposition if it's inconvenient for you you don't want to suffer the pain for another why should you what did they ever do for you being gentile your willingness to be that and bear that and identify like that
38:47 -  is unnatural it's a glory it's very God in his own nature manifested in his people in so effectual a way that it accomplishes the bringing forth in the day of a nation and it'll not come in in any other way as soon as zion prevailed when they said time to favor
39:10 -  zion has come it's not the issue of Israel's the issue of the church that is the church not just the clinically correct church but the compassionate and merciful church that prevails that's why i'm asking for the lord tonight break us up in the deep sludge
39:31 -  we've been hard too long dry-eyed too long to be merely correct is not correct enough something has got to begin to flow out from your nature because we cannot produce this this is not something that conscience will require us to adopt as if we can manufacture this this is what you are
39:51 -  in yourself you're a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief you're a sufferer you're compassionate you're merciful and we're hard-hearted we're not like you we've grown up in the world we've been taught to be insulated keep ourselves from showing emotion
40:11 -  we've guarded ourselves and we've hardened ourselves and therefore we we cannot unless you in your great mercy break us up in our deeps and bring us to that union of which the brother spoke last night or this morning
40:28 -  out of which in union with you your compassions can flow out through us this is not for a human imitation this is not the imitation of christ this is christ for those who move and live and have their being in him this is the ultimate test of it
40:47 -  this is the ultimate test of it God forbid we should fail it or produce some pseudo equivalent that is only the realm of sentiment that births nothing this is the zion for which God waits by which his glory will be perfected and revealed i've never spoken like this first time
41:10 -  i'm over my head i don't know what i'm talking about i haven't experienced it myself don't think because i'm jewish that i i qualify for an identification my own people greater than what God is asking of you it's beyond the issue of jewish it's beyond the issue of chinese
41:27 -  it's the issue of God and man and i'll have it only to the degree that you'll have it by the same faith the same appropriation the same union the same walk or i'll not have it at all Paul did not unceasingly anguish over his people with sorrow because he was a jew but because he was an apostle
41:47 -  because his life was derived from God and ours needs to be also and this will be the measure and the test of it if you'll allow the lord to break you in the deeps in the hard places that have never been broken so blessed
42:08 -  are those who mourn for they shall be comforted and they shall comfort others with the comfort wherewith they are comforted all because they have a capacity to mourn to have a tragic sense of life to respect sorrow and not to insulate themselves from it to come down and into the
42:29 -  valley of dry and hard places face it better to seek the house of mourning than the house of pleasure it says in the book of ecclesiastes but that's completely at odds with the pentecostal ethos of our time because if you're mournful and
42:51 -  sorrowful you're probably out of the faith you should be rejoicing and abounding you should be an overcomer you should what you're mourning you lack faith we got it all wrong you're mourning because you have faith faith of identification with the God who is a man of sorrows continually
43:15 -  it's not unbecoming to mourn to know sorrow to sense grief to sense the tragic disposition of this world and to ache for it and at the same time to have a joy in the lord that a paradox doesn't mean that your your face is down and the you're an object of pity there's an inward
43:36 -  sorrow even as you're rejoicing i think maybe that would be called Godliness that's being like the lord comes in one way only we can't imitate this we can't manufacture this we can't produce this it is what he is in himself he's the man of sorrows even before he came down
43:56 -  into the earth he grieved over the condition of mankind or he would not have come we need to share that nature saints and not allow our chinese history race origin tradition or culture to keep us from that union something has got to break something's got to be relinquished
44:19 -  however much we have been instructed or taken up this with the air with our mother's milk that a true person does not show emotion does not lend himself and make himself susceptible to hurt he insulates and protects and keeps himself and saves face a pox on that
44:38 -  that's from the pit that's from below that's uncomely an inhuman we need to be like him thank you lord you know the remarkable thing is whatever you think you've lost in chinese culture you have really acquired you might really then come in for the first time
45:00 -  to the distinctive that God intends for your race and nationality your culture is not the true expression of it it's a demonically distorted expression but to break in those things that allow the lord in is to find what you think you've lost maybe the world is waiting for
45:19 -  the first true expression of what is authentically chinese that God intended as a blessing for all the nations of the world so jeremiah was a prophet of tears and i myself am too dry i pray that i'm not myself the obstruction
45:40 -  i want to lend myself to be made tender and yielded to catch the inflection of God's voice the disposition of the spirit to see my own wicked heart its selfishness its vanity to lament my God where i should be sorrowing that even when we're right we're wrong even when we're
46:04 -  at our best we're at our worst what have we done at our best but render you the most necessary minimal service in which we cannot boast so lord this was your thought for tonight there's a dimension for which you're waiting it's the final dimension it completes
46:26 -  and releases you to come out from this zion this completion of zion and the fullness of God's own nature because what you have waited for in the church has been obtained now you can deal with Israel because what you have waited is now present
46:43 -  tonight zion it glorifies you because it's like you in its compassion and in its mercy and its attitude toward Israel now in her judgment proves it your authentic thing has come you're released now to turn to Israel and to deliver her lord let something begin tonight of an historic
47:06 -  kind because if it doesn't begin here and with the people of this kind where else where can we hope for it in the church let zion begin here lord let's let let something come we're asking for a disposition we're asking for mercy we need your mercy lord to break
47:29 -  we can't fabricate this we can't put ourselves in a condition to done ourselves into an attitude we're asking for a grace you're the God who breaks us up in the deeps we're asking that lord we need it we acknowledge it we're hard-hearted we're too dry-eyed we've been
47:49 -  too guarded too long keeping ourselves from from hurt but we're willing to be supple and yielded and dissolve before you or how else shall we travail for jerusalem and give birth in a day for that which would not otherwise come except we bear their pain come lord you know our hearts
48:12 -  let your word be as a hammer on the rock even the word that has come tonight to beat and beat and beat till it cracks and breaks and opens give us an honesty to acknowledge that yes we have been too dry-eyed too hard-hearted
48:29 -  correct in the chinese manner clinically but lacking that emotive precious quality that is your own we want that we desire that lord and we ask that you grant it come my God even bring a few drops bring bring a tear or two let let it begin thank you lord even if we cry over nothing else
48:54 -  then our dry-eyed condition let us begin crying and once we begin lord let there be a flow that it wouldn't take all that strenuous activity on your part to again bring us to the place of tears we'll find ourselves much more yielded much more disposed much more easily moved upon
49:15 -  to break to express emotion to identify to feel compassion so bless us tonight lord that you might be blessed because when the nations see it
49:34 -  they will serve the lord in your kingdom this ultimate demonstration does it for them but let it begin now thank you lord send the word let it perform its work
49:49 -  in every heart thank you my God we bless you come lord break us in the deeps thank you my God
