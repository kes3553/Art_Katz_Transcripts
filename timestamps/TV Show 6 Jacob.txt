TV Show 6 Jacob

00:00 -  Ben Israel with Art Katz and Paul Gordon hello welcome to Ben Israel my name is Art Katz and I am Paul Gordon as you know we're messianic Jews and you've probably wondered why we use the name Ben Israel for this program I want to
00:23 -  show you my the book that my brother Art wrote called Ben Israel and as you know in Hebrew Ben Israel means son of Israel and Art the word Israel wasn't always that was it wasn't a change from something else it's a very interesting
00:43 -  change and significant you know that that's the name that God gave to Jacob when he touched his life and transformed his character I think it's rather interesting to note the instances where God has transformed both the character
00:59 -  of men and their names Abraham became Abraham Jacob became Israel the New Testament Saul becomes a Paul and of course in a sense our names have been changed we've become Israel's having been Jacob's and I think it might be
01:19 -  interesting for our audience to have a sense of what that means and to see the transition what's required in the one who is a Jacob what does that represent and how does one become an Israel one having power both with God and with men
01:38 -  and again the story is given us in this wonderful book of Genesis the book of beginnings and we know the some of these circumstances of how Jacob was one of two twin sons along with Esau and that although Esau was the firstborn he
01:55 -  despised his inheritance and sold it for a mess of partage to a Jacob who treasured it but sought by his cunning to attain it and was forced to flee in exile from an angry brother who sought to slay him and so is so often the case
02:12 -  God has his first opportunity to deal with the Jacobs of the world when they're in flight and when they're in exile and I say this with a bit of melancholy and sadness because we Jewish Jacobs have been in exile now for 19th century since
02:32 -  70 AD when our temple and our city was destroyed and we were dispersed through all the corners of the earth I think God is dealing with us Jacobs as he has with our own lives personally why we're in a place of exile some of us have come to
02:47 -  prosper in exile but even then we don't enjoy the comfort and the affluence that we often oftentimes find there although our head is upon comfortable pillows they might just as well be a rock for all the nachos and satisfaction and joy that it
03:03 -  brings us and especially in our Jewish families today along with American families of every description we're finding children who have turned to drugs turn to witchcraft turn to Satanism turn to rebellion children who
03:20 -  no longer defer to their parents nor to their authority our heads are on pillows but for all effects and purposes for all of the joy and satisfaction we've achieved in our exile we might just as well be resting upon a stone that's the
03:34 -  place where God met this Jacob in the 28th chapter of Genesis we read in the 10th verse that Jacob went out from their Sheba and went toward her on and lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set
03:47 -  and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep the Sun had set upon his life I think that's a rather symbolic expression he sought to obtain spiritual things but in the end it caused
04:04 -  him to flee in exile and I think that's a time at least in my own experience when God begins first to encounter us when the Sun has set upon our natural life upon our own ambitions upon our own exertions in our dreams our aspirations
04:22 -  which have pushed him completely out of our lives when the Sun sets on that we find ourselves in exile with our head upon a stone it's then that we begin to experience a God calling to us as he called to this Jacob and he dreamed and
04:38 -  behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending upon it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of
04:51 -  Isaac the land whereupon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed you know precious people it's interesting not only take note of what God speaks but also to what he omits there's not a word that comes from the mouth of God which
05:08 -  is in any way happenstance no chance these are carefully measured words I'm the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac and their God stops he doesn't include Jacob in that phrase it was not yet the God of Abraham and the
05:24 -  God of Isaac and the God of Jacob the point is that Jacob had not yet Israel's God to be his God he had not yet come to that real relationship he was still a man in flight a man separated a man striving a supplanter one by his own
05:41 -  energy seeking to obtain the things that are spiritual before you continue a lot of people would probably take issue with this verse concerning the angels and behold the angels of God ascending and descending upon it you think there were
05:57 -  literally angels ascending and descending on this water well it was a dream I know that there are literal angels what does it suggest to you the only thing I was wondering is that many people will read the scripture and they
06:09 -  will attempt to rationalize or spiritualize everything out of the scripture I'll tell you Paul that I came to the Bible after a career as an atheist and I brought to the scriptures the same kind of habits that I had developed in
06:26 -  the academic world I thought that something was required of me by wave interpretation and when I found something that made my intelligence to boggle something that stunned me something which I could not take
06:37 -  literally I found ways to interpret it I want to find it allegorical and metaphorical but you know that my spiritual life went nowhere when I began to see that I stopped and began to receive the word as it is spoken as if
06:54 -  God means what he says and says what he means and from that day forth something began to work spiritually in my life to move me in a powerful way in God's direction I'm glad that you've raised this because we're going to be
07:07 -  frequently speaking out of the scripture perhaps to many people who are not accustomed to do so we want to suggest to you the same thing that we've experienced try taking God of his word if he speaks about angels ascending and
07:21 -  descending believe that that's what he means that there are such realities when it says that the Lord speaks believe that it's the Lord speaking but I think that the interesting thing here is for what God did not speak he did not say
07:35 -  that he was Jacob's God because he was not and that's an enormously important point to consider God is no one's God automatically he's not ours by virtue of the fact that we were born Baptist or Methodists or call ourselves Christians
07:50 -  or Jews or were baptized or bar mitzvahed or any such ceremonial thing in and of itself there's something that's that's got to happen in the life of a Jacob an encounter with the living God in which his life is touched his personality and
08:06 -  character transformed that a new name may be given that he might be one having power with God and with men it says in the New Testament scriptures that the word was with God and the word is God and the word was made flesh and dwelt
08:21 -  among us that the world was made by him but the world knew him not and that he came to his own and his own receive him not but praise God for these butts to as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God then
08:40 -  Israel means son of Israel the same kind of sonship to which God brought Jacob he's seeking to bring all men sons of God who know the father by experience and in a relationship having come to him in such a dynamic and authentic
08:57 -  existential way that their very lives and personalities are touched and transformed that they're given a new name it's interesting to see the reaction that Jacob had to this first visitation of God because in the 16th
09:11 -  verse we read and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and he said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of
09:24 -  heaven you know there are really two reactions to a visitation of God so blind joy joy unspeakable or unspeakable terror and fright oh you know the prophets speak of that I was reading the other day in Isaiah in fact I've been
09:44 -  I've got it marked here I think in the second chapter of Isaiah the 19th verse Isaiah speaks of the fear that the Lord can instill in us when we don't know him in the terrible day that the Lord comes Isaiah says and they shall go into the
10:04 -  holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord and for the glory of his majesty when he arises to shake terribly the earth and that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each
10:21 -  one for himself to worship to the moles and to the baths and go into the cliffs of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the Lord and for the glory of his majesty when he arises and shake terribly the earth and
10:38 -  you know art in the book of Revelation there's mention again about this very idea of man in fear actual fear of the Lord attempting to hide himself if we go into the sixth chapter of the book of Revelation verse 15 the Lord tells us
11:00 -  and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman you know he takes in everybody doesn't he every single manner of man that there could be
11:16 -  has caught up in these various descriptions hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
11:31 -  of the lamb for the great day of the wrath is come and who shall be able to stand I almost have the impression that because we've forsaken the fear of God I think especially in modern civilization our arrogance and our presumption our
11:47 -  conceit we have no sense of his magnitude of his holiness we act in complete indifference to whether he even exists or not we make virtually ourselves lords unto ourselves it's as if all of this unspoken and
12:04 -  unexperienced fear is going to be saved up for that last day it really is a thing of great terror and fright to meet the one who comes in great holiness whom we've chosen not to know and whom we've willfully neglected and I think that
12:19 -  the Jacobs reaction is an accurate response of fear but to whom shall his coming be joy to those whose sins are forgiven to those who have entered into relationship with him to those who know him to those who seek his coming and I
12:38 -  know that one of the great controversies that separate our Judaism messianic Judaism from conventional and rabbinical Judaism is the question of the coming of the Messiah whether is it one coming or two comings and we believe
12:53 -  of course that he came and that he's coming again that he came as a lamb of God but he shall come as the lion of Judah roaring and those who don't agree with our conviction and talk about a coming yet to be experienced I think
13:10 -  expressed that in a kind of a casualness that suggests that they're really not too eager nor concerned about the time of this coming there's a God who's looking for a people who will await him who will eagerly seek the time of his
13:26 -  appearing and we just pray that those who are watching this program and whose hearts are being open to God both Jews and Gentiles alike will come to that place to which God himself brought Jacob that when he comes they'll not seek for
13:39 -  clefts in the rock in which to hide you know what that reminds me of for instance a husband and a wife would be gone let's say for a week and they have three or four children and they come home and the children who have been good are waiting
13:56 -  expectantly for their return and maybe the other children were bad and they're waiting with fear because they know when the parents come home they're going to be punished well I think that's a very fit analogy and you know that Jacob is
14:11 -  a kind of a spiritual child so are we all until God begins to bring us to maturity no understanding and in this first visitation of God in his life he reacts childishly because we read in the 20th verse Jacob vowed a vow saying if
14:25 -  God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God I guess we might say that Jacob is quite a
14:39 -  sport and then if God will do all these things he might condescend to consider allowing God to be his Lord and you know that you can count up there are ten personal pronouns mentioned in this one prayer and I think that's characteristic
14:52 -  of the Jacobs of the world they're self seekers they're willing to give God a shake if he'll do this for them and that for them and help them in the way which they go but I want to assure you people with all that's in my heart that there's
15:04 -  a God who call who is calling us to the way that he goes he's calling us to his way and out of our way and such a prayer such a self-seeking prayer is not acceptable in God's hearing and so it is that these Jacobs which we are needs so
15:22 -  to be dealt with and processed and shaped by God to bring us to a proper place of commitment and to understanding now look at the concluding verse of this chapter Jacob had been lying with his head upon a stone has this vision of God
15:38 -  breathes this prayer and then we read and this stone which I've set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee again a very shrewd reckoning of a God of a man who
15:55 -  is very much the Jacob and we know that he took oil and he poured oil upon the stones nearby and he made of it a kind of a monument and I think that's rather descriptive of the kind of religion that Jacobs appreciate a religion that's
16:07 -  cheap a religion that's convenient a religion that's made of just of the materials that happen to be accessible and at hand a religion that does not require much but the pouring of a little oil on stones that are nearby at hand
16:20 -  and I tell you that there are people who would much rather endow synagogues or build wings on churches or buy pews or Israel bonds or the kinds of things which men do the things which are convenient rather than come to a God who calls them
16:36 -  totally to himself in a fearful and a radical way to a total commitment but Jacob was this way all along wasn't he even in his dealings with his brother Esau wasn't he a conniver even then he sought to get something of great value
16:54 -  cheaply and quickly by conniving that's true I wish we had the time to really speak about the story of Jacob in the detail that it deserves but we have to show how a Jacob becomes in Israel and God who has dealt with Jacob through
17:13 -  these years calls him again in the 32nd chapter to return to the land of his origin we read in that first verse Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and as he approached his land he sent before him messengers to seek out
17:27 -  his brother Esau who had had all these years to nurture his resentment and bitterness and wrath and his vengeance against a brother who he had considered to have stolen his birthright and the messages returned and said to Jacob in
17:42 -  the sixth verse we came to thy brother Esau and also he comes to meet thee and 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed you know that's that's the time when God has a chance in a man's life when we Jacobs who are full
17:59 -  of cunning full of designs full of shenanigans full of clever enterprises all kinds of solutions finally come to a place of such distress this of such extremity that our wit is no longer able to save us between the rock and the
18:13 -  That's exactly where God had Jacob he was greatly afraid and distressed but you know that even in that condition his wit continued to operate and we know that he divided his flock and his wives and his children and set one man to head the
18:26 -  other that should he lose one he would still yet be able to retain half and yet he does call upon God in that ninth verse oh God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord which said unto me return unto thy country you
18:39 -  see whatever we say about Jacob this much has to be acknowledged he was really an honest man his way who realized that although God was the God of Abraham and the God of his father Isaac he was not yet Jacob's God he knew his
18:53 -  condition that he knew his condition and yet he called upon him and told him that he's not worthy of the least of his mercy mercies and asked him to deliver him and yet even as he speaks these things out of one side of his mouth just
19:07 -  as Jacobs are given to do out of the other side he begins again to connive and to range for the circumstances of his own salvation people so long as we're persuaded that we can fashion our own salvation were yet Jacobs and Israel is
19:26 -  one who has come to God holy the God of his salvation and knows that only from him cometh his salvation and look at the elaborate means that he took 200 she goats and 20 other goats and hews and rams and milk camels and their colts and
19:42 -  cows and bulls and asses and foals and delivered them as an appeasement and as a gift to his brother that he perhaps could placate him and buy off his wrath in the 20th verse we read behold thy servant Jacob is behind us his servants
19:57 -  are saying for he said I will appease him with the present that goeth before me and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the four Jabbok and he took them and sent them
20:08 -  over the brook and sent over all that he had and Jacob was left alone Paul you know it and I know it that we had to come to such a place in our own lives such a place of extremity as Jacobs full of our own wit and full of our own
20:27 -  self-confidence when there was a time when we sent over all that we had we were stripped bare naked we were lost men we were desperate we were all alone and the stage is set in such a moment as that for a man to be found of God and
20:44 -  surely there was one waiting to be found we read Jacob was left all alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh the hollow of
21:00 -  Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and Jacob said I'll not let you go except that thou bless me praise God for a Jacob praise God for a Jewish heart like this that when he
21:14 -  does have his opportunity with that one who alone has the power to bless he will not let him go and friends we're just quoting the scripture that says he wrestled with a man we want to suggest to you today especially our Jewish
21:30 -  kinsmen that there's a man who has been waiting for us low these 19th centuries for us to come to the end of ourselves that we might wrestle with him who alone has the power to bless who 19 centuries ago forgave Jewish men their sins and
21:45 -  religious men murmured at him and said who is this who forgives men their sins for only God can forgive sin who blessed men who allowed men to fall at his feet worship him and call him Adonai Lord and God there's a man who's waiting to
22:00 -  wrestle with us as he wrestled with Jacob and accept that we wrestle with him and meet him face to face accept that he touch us in the hollow of our thigh in our masculinity in our own power and own self-sufficiency in our
22:14 -  own resourcefulness and leave us lame and halt and limp humbled made meek we cannot know him God is calling us to an encounter with one who was seeking for us to come to the end of ourselves waiting to wrestle with us have you come
22:31 -  to that place Paul you were something of an athlete why is it that God wrestled with Jacob what is there about the nature of wrestling that the Greeks celebrated and that even we recognize today as kind of the supreme and ultimate
22:45 -  sport I think you just said it the Greeks realized that it was the ultimate test of strength it was a manly thing wrestling it was a very masculine sport and that the wrestler who overcame his opponent it was a thing of strength it
23:01 -  was it was the only way to sum it up it was a manly sport how about this when we wrestle we wrestle out of the kishkas I apologize to our non-jewish viewers but the word kishka is a Jewish expression which speaks about the deep inward
23:17 -  things wrestling is something that demands ones all our physical strength our endurance our stamina our character now truly right out of the very depths of our being is all required and except that we've met God from our kishkas
23:31 -  eyeball to eyeball jowl to jowl face to face we've not met him at all and Jacob said he called the name of that place Peniel in Hebrew for I've seen God face to face and my life is preserved and God changed Jacob's name he said thy
23:49 -  name shall be called no more Jacob at Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed and it wasn't long after that people in the very next chapter that the Jacob who once sought a cheap and convenient
24:02 -  religion of pouring oil on convenient rocks bought himself an expensive piece of ground and he built there an altar and he worshiped God for the first time and he called that altar in the last verse of the 33rd chapter of Genesis
24:13 -  El Elohei Israel God the God of Israel from that day forth God was the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and Jacob's God and our question for you today is is he your God do you know him in spirit and truth have you met him are you willing
24:33 -  to come to the end of your own resources are you willing to come to the end of being the foundation of your own salvation are you willing to meet him in a deep way are you willing to come face to face with that one whom we've avoided
24:48 -  all through these centuries who alone has the power to touch us to change us to grant us a new nature to put his spirit within us to change our name and we ourselves might move from the religion of convenience to the religion
25:05 -  of great cost but of equally great value to follow him in the way which was not cheap for him which required the giving of his own life for if any man would come after me he said let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
25:20 -  me there's a Judaism of convenience but there's also a Judaism of great cost but it's a Judaism also a great reward a new nature a new life and eternity with a God who saves are you willing to meet him because I tell you people that
25:38 -  there's not a physical wrestling required only a yielding to him who wrestled the power of hell and death that we might know God in spirit and in truth now I think that wherever you are in your own living room at home today a
25:52 -  call out of the depths of your own inward being out of your kishkas out of your heart of hearts to this one whom we've avoided this man of whom Jacob said I've seen God face to face yet I live Jesus said if any man see me he
26:09 -  sees the father for I and the father one whosoever shall call upon this name shall be saved praise God would you like to be in Israel today rather than a Jacob a Schema one doomed to frustration living by your own wits there's a God
26:28 -  waiting for you to wrestle to send everything else before you to be left utterly alone to call upon him to be touched of him to know him I'd like to end as we began Paul in prayer yes that these words might really touch the
26:44 -  hearts of those who've heard that however they seem to be foolish that God is as close as their mouths that's what the scripture says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved let's pray together that there
26:57 -  might be such a union in such a meeting today of Jacobs who shall become Israel's precious God yes in the wonderful name of the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob we pray that even today in the hearing of
27:15 -  these words hearts may be open touch and voices may be raised to call upon you that Jacobs may become Israel to worship the living God in spirit and children thank you in Jesus name thank you we pray thank you
