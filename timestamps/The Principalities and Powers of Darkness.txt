The Principalities and Powers of Darkness

00:00 -  Uh do do
00:30 -  do do do
00:39 -  do do do
00:48 -  do do do
00:57 -  I'm so happy to be able to stand up so that I can ask you if I can take my jacket off. How about my tie?
01:10 -  Shall we give this speaker utter freedom? I want to invite you men also
01:19 -  to get comfortable. Hallelujah. We have a work
01:28 -  before us in these days. Of a remarkable magnitude. Namely the restoration of apostolic truth.
01:43 -  The bringing again of lost dimensions to the understanding of the church. The bringing again of lost dimensions
01:52 -  to the understanding of the church. The bringing again of lost dimensions to the understanding of the church.
02:01 -  Profoundly overdue and for which no man in himself is capable. And for which no man in himself is capable.
02:10 -  And for which no man in himself is capable. So in these two nights last night and tonight I had the same task
02:19 -  I had the same task the ministry of the restoration of Israel through the church
02:31 -  and tonight the principalities and the powers of the air. And both themes are co-joined. As you'll have the capacity for the one, you'll have the capacity for the other.
02:52 -  That both have been lost to the church is the statement of our unhappy condition. I was not commending Israel
03:06 -  for the sentimental interest of the saints. This is beyond sentiment. This is an apostolic perception of the place of Israel
03:25 -  in the purposes of God. Might even offend our sentimental sensibilities. But the issue is as much for our sake as for theirs.
03:47 -  So I hope I have your sympathy tonight. Because last night also I came loaded with papers and notes and outlines and when the hour to speak had struck
04:05 -  my eyes failed me even as it's happening now as if to say it's not by such a means
04:14 -  that these mysteries are going to be communicated. Only the Lord the head over his own church
04:25 -  will wash us by the water of the word that he will give will radically adjust our mentalities and restore the things that have been lost.
04:41 -  It's not an exaggeration to use the word work. It's a work. Which only he can perform.
04:53 -  So as we drove up tonight we were singing in the car Great is thy faithfulness Great is thy faithfulness
05:05 -  Morning by morning new mercies I see Morning by morning new mercies I see All that I have his great hand hath provided
05:18 -  Great is his faithfulness O Lord unto me So Lord we make that our prayer even now
05:30 -  Only by your faithfulness Only by the life that comes from above And from within
05:39 -  Having this treasure in our earthen vessels Lord as the high priest and the apostle of our confession We who have a heavenly calling
05:53 -  A privileged brethren Address us from this night on With a new kind of solemnity and seriousness
06:06 -  As if you were speaking to sons and daughters Who do not need to be babied To a church that is coming of age
06:21 -  And indeed will be made mature even by your word In these days A word that no man can bring by his own ability
06:33 -  Nor any church fulfilled by its ability Lord we are in this together And who is sufficient for these things
06:48 -  How long have you waited to hear us cry that word But we are embarrassed tonight Our Christianity has been so safe
07:00 -  So timid, so predictable So conventional, so respectable When have we had to say that
07:15 -  We have all lived in a Christianity that we can perform But it has not turned the world upside down Nor has it made jealous your people Israel
07:31 -  And this much we understand even from the beginning That that church that is equipped to confront The principalities and the powers of the air
07:42 -  Over its own cities and nation Will by that same qualification move Israel to jealousy It's one and the same thing
07:57 -  So Lord address us Have mercy on the servant that you love Whom you have taken by surprise by the number of people who are here
08:09 -  Who thought that we would have a casual beginning tonight With about 20 people But we have to be careful
08:21 -  But you know who is here Speak now Great Alpha and Omega
08:32 -  Give us the beginning my God that is in your heart of wisdom That you might bring us to the conclusion of these days That is an Omega conclusion
08:49 -  And that will require much from us For we're asking much We thank you for this
09:01 -  We are a privileged people Speak now for thy servants here In Jesus name we pray
09:13 -  So if anybody wants to leave now is the time I'm really deadly serious There might be some who wish they had left earlier at Lausanne
09:30 -  Before the Lord had brought us down on our knees before him In an utter surrender to his demand The true speakings of God are becoming more and more expensive
09:48 -  And I'm not talking about the collection box And frankly I'm happy that such an hour has arrived Would to God it had always been this expensive
10:05 -  The Lord would have had a glorious church before now So what do you know about the principalities and powers of the Lord So what do you know about the principalities and powers of the air
10:23 -  What should we know Isn't it some antique aspect of Paul's rabbinical Judaic upbringing A kind of idle curiosity for us
10:46 -  I mean how relevant is such a subject in this modern age Some reference to some invisible spirit realm that broods in the air over the nations I'll tell you that the theologians have not taken Paul seriously
11:10 -  Or the church in general Much to the detriment of the church And to the victimization of the world and the nations
11:30 -  As we Americans like to say this is where the action is And that church that will not recognize that fact And fight at that level
11:50 -  Dooms itself to futility Though it may continue to conduct services endlessly A futility as it pertains to the purposes of God
12:10 -  And the church that will not embrace his purposes However happy their services Is not the church
12:22 -  Certainly not an apostolic church And you will excuse my simplicity and naivety If it's not apostolic neither is it the church
12:40 -  Let's look at a verse in Ephesians chapter 2 Verse 1 and 2 Here is one of Paul's few references to the powers of the air
13:22 -  A phrase whose very nature offends our modern mentality It's contrary to the scientific and rational and empirical spiritual Of our age
13:46 -  Because it refers to an invisible realm So perhaps this is just a kind of Biblical mode of speaking Rather than a statement of some very earnest and literal reality
14:01 -  And so has the church dismissed these references All of the brilliant German theologians Even the Swiss ones
14:17 -  Carl Bach for example Until the Second World War Then they were willing to consider
14:31 -  Perhaps we were hasty In dismissing this as Paul's mythologizing That this was some kind of Hebraicism
14:45 -  Or some element out of his rabbinical and Judaic past This Jewish apocalyptic angelology World War II changed everything
15:01 -  Why? Because for the first time in modern history The principalities and the powers of the air that had up to that time
15:15 -  Been content merely to adversely influence nations Had now taken one captive The result was almost the total extermination of my Jewish people
15:34 -  And the obliteration of western civilization We had a demonstration of its deadly power And its murderous nature and wisdom
15:50 -  And if it could happen in Germany In the land of Goethe, Schiller, Fichte and Hegel Schopenhauer, Mozart, Beethoven and so on
16:05 -  What about Switzerland? What about the USA? Or the United States?
16:16 -  Where was the church at that time? Totally powerless Inept
16:31 -  Incapable even of discerning the nature of the phenomenon It was impossible for them to understand the nature of the phenomenon Let alone being able to counter-attack it
16:48 -  In fact I think it's safe to say that the very absence of a vital and apostolic Christianity in Germany The failure to see the full realization of the reformation The failure to see the full realization of the reformation
17:12 -  And the bloody extermination of that radical reformation wing That might have assured it, the Anabaptists Created a spiritual vacuum into which these demonic powers came
17:32 -  Created a spiritual vacuum into which these demonic powers came And what began in the basement of a beer hall With a bunch of punks and homosexuals and drifters and weirdos
17:54 -  Occultists Scum The whole of the state and of society
18:10 -  There is a very expensive price to pay in the absence of the apostolic reality of true church And don't you cluck your tongues at the Germans But go from here to that Spitzer place
18:33 -  And watch the same phenomenon at its inception Powers of darkness moving with complete sway Totally unchecked
18:57 -  Bringing their victims into hell without any resistance I can't get the sight out of my memory And we went there a couple of nights ago
19:11 -  And watched these kids with the needles in their arms In a public place, in a park By the chief church of the reform movement I think
19:27 -  They were like pin cushions every two hours And when they could not find the vein in their arm, they rolled up their pants I saw one man holding up a mirror for a young girl
19:45 -  That she could find the vein in her neck that she could use God will put the indictment for that at the door of the church I don't want to spend too much time on this
20:05 -  But you cannot understand the phenomenon of Nazism Without understanding the powers of the air And how many of its leaders were disillusioned, idealist and spiritual
20:27 -  And how many of its leaders were spiritualists Men who were actually spiritually questing for something Disenchanted and bored with middle class, bourgeois success
20:51 -  Wanting some kind of deep engagement of their souls and spirits And not being able to find it in a conventional Protestant, Catholic society Moved into the forms of occultism that later became Nazism itself
21:13 -  It's the course of this world According to the prince of the power of the air The spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience
21:33 -  Now works, working tonight in sons of disobedience In this very city, in this reformed land And over the face of the earth
21:48 -  It's now working I marvel at the faith of God He has put all his eggs in one basket
22:05 -  His whole confidence and hope for the redemption of his creation That is now being desecrated by these powers and blaspheme that ruined Rests exclusively with the church
22:25 -  No other agency And no one else has the authority to do so No other institution
22:42 -  Can understand this spirit realm Let alone combat it But the weapons of our warfare are not carnal
22:54 -  But spiritual And only a spiritual people can wield them Let's turn to chapter 6 of the same book of Ephesians
23:09 -  Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might Paul tells us, verse 10 If there's not that possibility for me tonight
23:25 -  Or for us in the calling which is ours in God We of all people are most to be pitied In fact, if we are not willing to be made weak
23:40 -  And to know what it means to experience infirmity Where if God be not God, we perish We will never know the power of his might
23:57 -  We will never know the power of his might And that's why we have not known it Especially being Swiss
24:11 -  Or Jewish We like to have the control of the situation And have the ability to handle what is before us
24:23 -  On the basis of our powers, our expertise Our ability, our strength Anything other than that is a humiliation
24:39 -  To be weak Weak Foolish
24:49 -  And that's why God is not going to allow Our present Israel to succeed However impressive a show it made
25:08 -  And came within an inch of succeeding Other nations have taken 2,000 years We Jews only need 40
25:22 -  To resuscitate a dead language To establish our own civilization Become the third or fourth greatest military power in the earth
25:34 -  We almost succeeded On the basis of Jewish expertise And ability to form an Israel
25:45 -  Which is not the Israel of God Because it does not glorify him If we are going to know the power of his might
26:04 -  We will have to know what it means to be weak And to welcome it And to suffer the humiliation of it
26:18 -  As I'm willing to do before you tonight Who thought I was going to get off easy with just a small little audience That in a kind of a casual way we would have made it through the evening
26:37 -  That I walk into a full room And bang, the time has come It's time to begin
26:46 -  In a serious way We cannot misspend the occasion Who is sufficient for these things
26:55 -  And who of you is deceived to think That if there's any authority or power or clarity coming from me That it's my own virtue
27:09 -  Don't be deceived by appearances If you could feel the deep exhaustion that is in my body And the dullness of my mind
27:22 -  And not knowing humanly how to begin Or to continue to conclude You go to bed
27:36 -  We're going to have to know the rest of God We're going to have to restore the Shabbat of God And not just for Samstag
27:47 -  But every day it needs to be lived out of that rest As ceasing from ourselves Our own ability, religiously speaking
27:59 -  Which may impress us And may impress others But do you know what the powers of the air say about it?
28:11 -  About Jesus we know and Paul we know But who are you? They're only required to recognize the power of his might
28:24 -  To those who have voided their own natural strength and ability And that's the people who have finally unlearned their own strength So let us put on the whole armor of God
28:40 -  That we might stand against the wiles of the devil For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood But against principalities and powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age
28:59 -  But against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places Not the same heaven that our God occupies But a lesser stratum
29:20 -  That is over the earth in the atmosphere of the earth Which defies our scientific analysis And yet we use the phrase, there's something in the air
29:37 -  Anyone who has ever crossed borders into East Germany or Czechoslovakia Knows who I'm talking about Will come into Egypt and it will be the end of the world
29:48 -  Or come into Egypt, an Islamic country There's something in the air And we can feel it just as we cross a border
30:08 -  Because there's a particular prince over that locality With a whole hierarchical demonic order Related to the history of that place
30:23 -  That exudes such an uncomfortable presence that it can be felt We're not speaking about an imaginary thing We're not speaking about an imaginary thing
30:40 -  But a real And God is trusting that we are going to unseat those powers Who are tyrannizing entire races and nations of men
30:59 -  Unaware of the demonic influence that is upon their life Because it even cloaks itself in the institutions of society itself Someone needs to blow the whistle
31:22 -  And let the world know of the massive deception that is taking place The spirit that still prevails in the world Now, working in the sons of disobedience
31:42 -  Who are not even aware that they're being played upon God has only one answer for this An apostolic church
31:56 -  That wrestles We wrestle not against flesh and blood But we wrestle
32:09 -  We wrestle Not some individual virtuoso It's either going to be we
32:21 -  Or a nun at all What a mandate we have That before we can even enter the combat
32:33 -  We have to come to a corporateness and an integration of life One with another By which even that wrestling is made possible
32:46 -  Which runs contrary to our nature And our love of privacy And comfort and convenience
33:02 -  Which allows us to be Sunday Christians With our impressive programs And charismatic agendas
33:15 -  But does not in one way threaten the powers of the air I almost want to say at the beginning If you're not prepared to be a we
33:33 -  Why bother to attend the balance of these nights If you're not willing for a radical alteration of your lifestyle By which we can indeed become a we
33:51 -  As against what we now represent A collection of individualities Who are willing to sit alongside each other for the purpose of a service
34:07 -  But not much more We wrestle And what shall we say about wrestling
34:23 -  It's not a polite activity This is not tish tennis However much I like the game
34:32 -  This is bloody Sweaty Full of impolite grunts
34:43 -  This is more than just the issue of skill However important skill is Even the issue of strength
34:56 -  But in the last analysis Wrestling is an ultimate kind of combat In the last analysis the issue is moral
35:10 -  Rather than physical Do we have the determination The ability to endure
35:21 -  The determination not to lose The willingness to give everything that's required to obtain the victory Do we have the grit, the stamina, the fortitude
35:39 -  The holy determination Who are now so easily depressed The air goes out of us so quickly
35:52 -  We don't feel like going to the meeting If the Lord says maybe Somebody looked at us in the wrong way
36:04 -  Or they didn't greet us as we think we should be greeted And we're out of commission for a week So infintely
36:16 -  Sensitive We wrestle I'm just willing to congratulate the Lord tonight
36:28 -  For allowing the principalities and the powers of the air to exist That he has given us the mandate to Israel That he gives us ultimate requirements
36:50 -  For they are given for our sake Or else we would be content with much less Than the apostolic call of God
37:05 -  That unto him there should be glory in the church Thank you Lord These two components
37:26 -  The restoration of Israel And the principalities and the powers of the air Are vitally necessary to the apostolic mindset
37:43 -  The Lord did something at Lausanne It was so glorious that the first tape was ruined But there came a time after we had gone down on our knees
38:04 -  And said yes to the God who had called us to the earth But there came a time after we had gone down on our knees And said yes to the God who had called us to the ultimacy of this task
38:21 -  To move in Israel to jealousy Who has been so historically and justifiably turned off by anything that is called the church That the only way that we could fulfill such a requirement
38:47 -  Is by our own transformation Exactly the intention of God And I watched it happen in a night
38:59 -  As God will birth a nation in a day He birthed a church in a day In a night
39:10 -  Something happened to our faces A new earnestness A deep high seriousness
39:22 -  The whole casual air of the church went out the window And we just seemed to be girding ourselves for our true calling The whole corporate atmosphere had changed in that room
39:42 -  We had been made a people of God By saying yes to an ultimate requirement Beyond any ability to fulfill in ourselves
40:03 -  Exactly the same with the powers of the air Who is sufficient for these things? This is going to take more than just the formula in the name of Jesus
40:18 -  This is more than even the issue of individual deliverance In fact, I'm willing to be foolish enough to say tonight That that might even be, in some degree, a deception allowed us by the devil
40:34 -  That we might think that the whole issue of demonic spirit Is the issue of individual deliverance And miss the cosmic issue itself
40:51 -  And then the whole cosmic meaning itself And then the whole cosmic meaning itself And then the whole cosmic issue itself
41:05 -  Because we would like to be rid of something with just a phrase in the name of Jesus But this requires much more A people who are themselves freed from the influence of the powers of the air
41:28 -  Who tyrannize entire nations by manipulation, by threat, by fear Jesus made an open spectacle of them at the cross But he didn't altogether expunge them
41:54 -  Their power is broken But even in that condition In the ignorance of mankind about them
42:07 -  They still continue to exert their terrible influence But wherever there is a congregation of God's people Who have been freed from that influence
42:28 -  Who are themselves a people without fear Who do not tremble for their security Who do not be induced or seduced or enticed by ambition, by lust, by reward
42:50 -  Who do not live at the horizontal and lateral visible level of life But see the things that are invisible and eternal And know that every good and perfect thing comes down from above
43:09 -  From the father of lights in whom is no shadow of turning And not from an employer Not from the state
43:24 -  Or the health or the security of the economy A people who can suffer opposition Even persecution and reproach
43:51 -  Because if they get serious about the powers of the air Who will then have to say Jesus I know and Paul I know And the church at Zurich too
44:11 -  Then you can expect that you are going to experience A new quality of opposition And oppression and persecution that you have not known before
44:27 -  The fact that we have not is to our shame and to our scandal That this should be absent from our experience as believers And that we should attribute it to the fact that we are not living behind the iron curtain
44:56 -  Not recognizing that the powers are just as effectual here as there And will express their fury here just as well as there When they see a people rise to a stature that threatens them
45:18 -  A people who will have to come to the same place to which Jesus came To which the Anabaptists came And to all who have suffered for the faith in every age
45:41 -  Such a sublime and total confidence in the living God That we should walk through this world In his power and his sovereignty
46:02 -  Such a sublime and total confidence in the living God Both his power and his sovereignty That we should walk through this world without fear
46:24 -  The prince of this world comes, but he has nothing in me But then Pontius Pilate said to Jesus Come on, get nervous
46:39 -  Be like every other man Show your insecurity That God talks in your professions about him
46:54 -  That shows that you agree with our wisdom Of what life is really all about And what undergirds reality
47:09 -  Taking care of number one Self-survival Self-preservation
47:18 -  Come on, get scared Show that you're just a religious phony Because we have you now in our power
47:30 -  Jesus said you could do nothing against me Except that we're giving you from above But do you know what, children?
47:43 -  It is given from above And will you bear it then? And drink that cup?
47:53 -  Because I'm going to tell you now The whole point of this seminar That you'll hear at the end
48:06 -  The thing that shall conclude what Jesus began In this conflict between the powers of light and darkness Of what was expressed at the cross of Christ Jesus
48:23 -  When the total malignity of the powers of the air Their hateful, spiteful, destructive and violent wisdom When the total malignity of the powers of the air
48:37 -  When the total power of death Their wisdom and their cleverness Was ventilated without restraint
48:48 -  On one who was completely defenseless in his weakness And what he exhibited then In ultimate extremity and trial
49:11 -  Was another wisdom Another moral way That when that dumb, dead-piled clod
49:22 -  Who was at the base of the cross, that centurion saw him die When that dumb, unwise soldier When Jesus saw him die
49:34 -  Who had no religious education He was a trained murderer He saw one after the other at the cross
49:46 -  Crying out for their fleshly lives Or spitting out curses He saw this one die
49:55 -  Who yielded up the ghost Lay not this sin to their charge Forgiving those who were murdering him
50:07 -  Even those for whom he came Bearing their mocking jeers and taunts Come off the cross and we will believe you
50:23 -  But he could not He would not And when the centurion saw this
50:36 -  Who had no biblical framework Of understanding whatever Cried out involuntarily
50:48 -  Truly this is the son of God I wonder if we are not coming full circle And we are being moved to a final demonstration
51:04 -  Of the same wisdom that was expressed At the cross through Christ That can only be expressed in ultimate and utter trial
51:17 -  And by which the powers of the air Were openly spoiled and made a spectacle But the completion of what he began
51:31 -  Remains with us By our own will But the completion of what he began
51:43 -  Is carried out by us By a demonstration of the same wisdom The same patience and suffering
51:58 -  The same ability to forgive those who are tormenting us Unto death The same love for our enemies
52:11 -  The willingness to bear suffering In the fulfillment of the eternal purposes of God Isn't that what it says in Ephesians chapter 3
52:27 -  We'll end with it now but we'll pick it up tomorrow The mystery of the eternal purposes of God The mystery of the eternal purposes of God
52:47 -  Paul asks for a grace even to make it known That all might see What is the fellowship of the mystery in verse 9
53:06 -  He says for me was this grace given And I am experiencing a measure of that grace tonight To say as much as I have said
53:21 -  Requires grace This is not a lecture folks We're being called to an event in God
53:34 -  A word that performs a work in them that hear it It takes grace To communicate what has been so long lost to God's people
53:51 -  One can almost say willfully lost For we've had no stomach for apostolic reality For us charismatic would have been enough
54:06 -  Because we intuited well enough that Charismatic reality requires an apostolic suffering It takes grace to communicate this mystery
54:27 -  What will it take to fulfill it By the remnant church of Jesus Christ Everywhere in the world
54:41 -  God give us grace to make all men see What is the fellowship of the mystery Which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God
54:55 -  And still greatly lost Who created all things through Messiah Jesus To the intent that now
55:09 -  Or in order that now The manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church To the principalities and powers in the heavenly places
55:26 -  My God, what a mouthful No wonder they said Paul is mad He's not fit to live
55:39 -  They threw dirt on their heads And vowed that they would not eat or drink until he would be killed This is apostolic madness
55:55 -  Or it is ultimate sanity One or the other That God has created all things
56:08 -  The whole of creation, the cosmos The nations, its societies Its institutions, its cultures
56:19 -  The whole natural basis by which The earth can be populated and sustained Not that the nations should glorify themselves thereby
56:34 -  But to the intent In order that Through the church
56:43 -  Why don't we just stop right there And fall on our faces Without having to hear the rest of it
56:52 -  We're suffering from a gross inferiority complex We have an inadequate sense of the church Which is his glory
57:04 -  Of which he is the head that filleth all in all That he created all things That through the church
57:18 -  My God, forgive us That we thought it was an institution for our benefit To bring us a succession of Sunday services
57:30 -  And give our children opportunity in the Sunday school And a place to get married and buried How do you like the service?
57:45 -  How many of you will be saying that when you leave tonight? How did you like it? How did you like the speaker?
57:56 -  Did you like it? Have you noticed what we do? Everything is measured in terms of how it affects us
58:07 -  Do we like it? Did we enjoy it? When have we considered him?
58:19 -  And until we will We will have a sick church Locked in its egocentrism
58:32 -  Did you like it? Did you enjoy it? And if you don't, you can always find another place
58:41 -  Another speaker Another congregation And we don't become the way that can wrestle
58:53 -  May God give us an apostolic view May God give us an apostolic view Which is to say things as God himself sees them
59:02 -  Which is to say things as God himself sees them The church The church
59:11 -  As the eternal masterpiece of God As the eternal masterpiece of God Not some institution that serves the purposes of men
59:20 -  Not some institution that serves the purposes of men Because God has created all things Yes, look out the window and see the whole apparatus
59:30 -  The panoply of society and civilization It's not for itself It's to bring an order and a provision in the world
59:42 -  It's to bring an order and a provision in the world To sustain the life of men That there might be a church
59:53 -  That fulfills the eternal purpose of God That fulfills the eternal purpose of God That's what it says in verse 11
01:00:02 -  That's what it says in verse 11 And if we will not be occupied with his eternal purpose And if we will not be occupied with his eternal purpose
01:00:14 -  And if we will not be occupied with his eternal purpose We will have no consequence for the present We will have no consequence for the present
01:00:23 -  That's the very nature of the church That's the very nature of the church A peculiar organism
01:00:32 -  A peculiar organism Whose principal passion is to fulfill an eternal purpose of God Whose principal passion is to fulfill an eternal purpose of God
01:00:41 -  And will be relevant in time And will be relevant in time To the degree that it does so
01:00:50 -  And will be relevant in time To the degree that it does so And what is that eternal purpose?
01:00:59 -  And what is that eternal purpose? For which reason he has created all things? That through the church
01:01:08 -  The manifold wisdom of God Whatever that is Might be demonstrated
