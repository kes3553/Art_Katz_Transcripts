Jacob Becomes Israel 3 of 3

00:00 -  Everybody knows what it means to glean the field and after the harvest was taken the fields were open to the poor, to come and to glean what is always left behind and that's what's in my heart tonight to go back over the field and glean it. Don't think that we've done an exhaustive job,
00:23 -  there's so much so much there so it's still in my heart, my spirit is still resonating over that text. For example the statement the sun rose upon Jacob after that wrestling match that's more than just a uh letting us know what time it was you know there's always something
00:49 -  there's some some something symbolic in a statement like that the sun rose on Jacob I'm waiting for the sun to rise on the people of Israel they've been living in a night for a long time in the darkness has everybody met Gerda from Denmark and your sister does that make you
01:11 -  oh it's my sister glad to have you with us Gerda so let's go back to uh Genesis
01:26 -  uh anybody have any thoughts that are percolating from this morning any continuing insight that the Lord gave or something that you
01:50 -  continue to ponder that you might express before we commence I like the sentence Jacob was left alone to wrestle and you know the people who gleaned the country after the harvest has been done there were poor people as we say but they were also
02:14 -  in Israel Jacob he became an old car when he was left alone he was totally dependent on God because everything he has sent away and I think God wants us to come there that we are willing to be an outcast for him in these last days can anybody think of a companion text where a
02:35 -  revelation of God comes by a man who has been suddenly and abruptly been left alone so how do you see that script of his children
03:02 -  I was thinking of Isaiah in the day that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord hand lifted up yeah isn't it remarkable how the scripture the Lord of the scripture is not constrained to explain everything he just puts it there I think he's waiting for those who
03:20 -  will ask the conjunction why do you tell us are you just telling us a certain time that we know when this man died that this revelation came or is the revelation in some way related to the fact that King Uzziah died that I got that Isaiah has such a relationship with this man
03:38 -  that took so much of his heart and his emotion and thought in mind that it even cheated and distracted him from the relationship with yourself another instance would be the death of Abraham's father and so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken so many years before God had said get the
04:01 -  out-of-nation children father's house but Abraham when he left did not come into the promised land but lingered along the same Euphrates River and found himself in another place called Haran the place of delay it actually means delay because he went with his father and would lock his cousin
04:21 -  and everything that God said he should not he did and so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken when terror his father died so it is really remarkable how powerful these natural and legitimate things are that keep us from a total availability to God so why do we have to wait for the natural
04:46 -  death of someone if by an act of determined ruthlessness we can ourselves separate ourselves from that which would distract us from God that we can bring ourselves to being in a place alone because evidently it's a key that when Jacob was left alone there that night they rest with him
05:12 -  a man I think two other figures that are exactly all the Elijah alone in the cave now the apostle Paul alone for three days that was perhaps a depth of aloneness aloneness that was very significant I'm amazed at the the depth and consciousness of the total turn around
05:33 -  and the revelation that Paul had in such a short time of the Messiah and as he immediately began to scoot with the Jews about the science and it's a profound thing I want to say that Israel's passing through the wilderness of the nations is not some requirement from God that is
05:55 -  geographical but is altogether basically and principally spiritual because they must be a people separated from every kind of comfort and solace that Jews as modern people have found for themselves in commiseration with other men with like-minded people with family with friends with
06:18 -  society with being able to come in and go out at will to living well a wilderness time is a time being utterly stripped and what has kept men from an awareness of the reality of God as the fundamental truth of life is that their lives are hedged about with this and without and
06:44 -  all kinds of things to fill the time and the air with sound with talk with food with fellowship with going with cars with possessions that's my people their whole life is a spending and getting and there's a necessity why they must be stripped utterly in order to bring them into that
07:03 -  confrontation with God where true value is revealed because the false values that predominate in this world and this life have been stripped away and that's in a sense what happened to Jacob he sent over all that he had and he was utterly alone and that night so as we said this morning
07:26 -  we're reading an historical episode but we're also reading into something future in history something that will take place with the Jacob people that they might also become Israel. I think Jacob too is very interesting because in the next chapter I think that the
07:45 -  change in Jacob is so profound and I think the thing that gives us a good clue one of the main clues besides him limping physically is the way he sees Esau his brother he says Esau I see you as an angel of God I mean here's this guy you know I mean I suspect that corporate Israel will someday
08:00 -  see even the Gentiles as perhaps maybe you know or see Esau in the Arab world but even though ordeal they will go through corporately which I do well they will be marked scarred as well in order to recognize them aside something in that whole thing that makes me we've discussed
08:16 -  with this woman with the thing that I was thinking of the fashion was that you know to expect a stripping to expect that you're going to go down you know like I was saying this morning you know you can't at noontime decide I'm going to you know I'm going to go through this midnight experience
08:37 -  this nighttime experience but expected it will come it will come in fact I remember in the 93 score I looked in the page you said if you're going to be pathetic expect a stripping and that's exactly what my life is eventually
09:02 -  um yeah I'm glad you're saying that because I'm trying to formulate a thought something like this that's this seeing of Esau as the face of God was that a momentary
09:38 -  blessing that came as the result of his experience with the angel who wrestled with him and would soon enough dissipate away or was it the definitive reality of things as God would have meant to see them which is rarely seen
09:56 -  help me in this that moment of seeing that was afforded Jacob in the face of Esau was that just a momentary blessing and will soon dissipate away and the reality of what Esau is and what Jacob is would be returned with resume or in that moment was there a glimpse of how God would
10:19 -  have meant to see always that is to say that our present seeing is substandard our present seeing is distorted that what we think to be actual and real is in fact not so and that reality and what is real and true are things as God sees them and when I have them to be seen so
10:42 -  uh be remarkable if something could happen that so transfigures our seeing that the enemy is no longer an object of fear or resentment or hatred but an object of love because that's the way God sees them so may all our seeing be affected but just to know that there's another possibility
11:05 -  to see it than the way we have presently seen and that the way we have presently seen is not momentous this is not reality it's deception and illusion it's corrupted tincture tainted true seeing is through the purity of God through the life of God and God seeing that's what happened
11:24 -  to Jacob in that moment I can only pray that it was more than a moment something of an enduring kind had come through that would affect all of his future seeing so you know I think you could see it in relationship to the limit that um there was an alteration a physical alteration
11:49 -  that I think was not so much the biggest thing but the alteration inside and the byproduct of that alteration inside of that physical that the rest of his life physical was the external state that does something for you the lip is really in this
12:06 -  I wanted to if there's something that God did with Jacob it wasn't just in that moment I think that moment was a culmination but I get the impression that when Jacob finished his rest and he saw it you saw it was the the outworking of those 20 some years of his own given his own deceptions through
12:21 -  levin and all the whole business and it's very interesting that later on his son joseph uh seems to have had that kind of thing in his spirit where he sees his brothers as you meant for evil but God meant for good a whole different kind of scene and it seems there's something bestowed upon jake
12:37 -  which i think was even transmitted to joseph that God expressed in that line it's kind of that kind of paradox again you know why do you think it is that God took such pains with jimka he's getting more attention more remarkable uh personal dealing with God than perhaps some of the other patriarchal
12:59 -  for example was never treated for such revelation encounters confrontations what is it about jacob you think that made him a candidate for such attention more needy huh more needy more needy okay well I think it's something to do with the election
13:16 -  of God too because it's amazing that God says Jacob I love you saw I hate it that's all more remarkable that jacob has an adjective brother that I see as an angel of God knowing is something I think it was a knowing I just don't know how to say it but I think when you've been gone the elect
13:33 -  person from the womb which I believe Jacob was and he saw there's somehow there's a knowing maybe not fully but a gradual knowing even in the patriarch himself that that God has something for him I mean even way back in Bethel I mean he there was something operating in Jacob that was
13:50 -  operating that matured was broken and purified and dealt with I think it always was a certain knowing uh it's sort of implied in the scriptures he was a man of the field of the herds you know and he saw the country on this there's there's a loop why is why is it out to take the same field
14:04 -  that there's something in that um which I think is part of the destiny of Israel itself is the nation come out of Jacob you know yes for the day yeah and the nation indeed gets the same kind of attention exactly confrontation and feeling as is yet future and then he's the father of
14:22 -  the nation Israel his sons constitute the formation of the nations they are the progenitors of the whole of Israel so what he will be as a father to these sons will in turn affect all that continues from them is remarkably significant maybe for that reason he has to have a deeper
14:43 -  apprehension of God than would be afforded by the men in terms of a significant role that he plays with the 12 sons that will go up from him it's a shame that church has lost the original meaning of of of Israel that Jacob Israel being prince of God and perhaps how the church understood that
15:00 -  Israel even though in her fallen condition and you know right broken off still a prince of God and that that she would prevent he would prevail with God in the men ultimately you know I mean because the church lost that revelation as well just as this Jacob this single Jacob is a man like
15:16 -  that well this Israel's history the history of the Jewish people is a contradiction they have neither prevailed with men right because the victim right at the hands of men and God has trimmed his face from that second exhibited the pre-Israel Jacob they've been pretty much more
15:31 -  of a chicken than but yeah my mother wants equal time here
15:46 -  I mean women have a strong alliance with sons yeah and with Rebecca and him going here Isaac and I mean God has to deal with that relationship as well because women don't hold
16:06 -  on to their sons very strongly especially sons who are pastors and a lot of that Jezebel spirit I mean where you know let's let's do this let's plan this and this can happen and I think you can be moved up in that direction you know you can be elevated so I think I have to deal with that
16:28 -  relationship as well she's the prototype of Jewish mothers who want good things for this you don't have to have to obtain them illegally once you're right-handed once you're left more you know
16:45 -  so you know what we didn't touch at all verse 27 after Jacob says I will not let you go unless you bless me so he said to him what is your name he said Jacob what a strange reply
17:06 -  through the cry of Jacob I'm not going to go this is if the word itself is changing the subject but I don't think it's a distraction it follows upon the request which is not going to be granted until something is going to be
17:22 -  expressed about the meaning of names what is your name is it does it imply that the the angel of the lord doesn't know why does he ask Jacob what he already knows what is your name and Jacob says Jacob he doesn't say don't you know divinity you know
17:51 -  but when he says Jacob what do you think may have happened why did God ask it why why is this inserted in the text we've got to be rooted in the text and go over it with that fine-tooth comb not let a syllable escape us there's nothing here that's accidental
18:08 -  or thrown into effect everything that took place in that remarkable encounter of God with man and ultimate wrestling is charged with meaning yes it's because here he had been through the five his character has even changed and with the change of character God gives him a new name
18:29 -  that fits in with the new character okay that's true and why is he asking him this name somehow I think that you've got to see who you are as God sees you in your in your in your next attitude face whatever that is before you can move to the next life I think you're on to something
18:57 -  okay the same reason you have to add him where are you huh the same reason you have to add him where are you that you felt it gives attention on his own his own uh you know he knew where I was and he felt in the garden and I had a word argument oh good Adam had a
19:14 -  right right so to what realization does the lord's question bring taker by asking him what is your I think it brings him to a form of repentance it says when he tells my name is um the planner right
19:43 -  that's my name I knew but he wanted him to tell him yeah he wanted him to know I really know deeply that his name was the statement of what he was as a man
19:57 -  before God would confer the blessing that would change him yeah because how much of a blessing is lost if we don't appreciate his value and it just comes out of God's grace and we don't haven't taken full stock of what we were before the blessing
20:18 -  came that we might appreciate it more truly or fully so I think there's all of this is true isn't the lord remarkable instead of telling him instead of taking him by the ear instead of recommending him instead of giving a flashback of his life he let him do it you you know
20:39 -  something is not your own till you make it you've got to appropriate something it's got to be be your own you could be instructed you can hear tapes what is salvation and you can maybe give a doctrinal answer but have you made it your own have you really reviewed it taken it into your
21:00 -  spirit and I think that came the lord was asking jacob more than his name but a realization of what his name has signified all through his life that he might appreciate now the magnitude of the change that is going to come that would be so great that the old name can no longer apply
21:22 -  the change is so great that a new name must be created and it's created by God I'll tell you it's one thing to have a name given by your parents who built over your cradle shall we call her dawn shall we call her daphne but it's another thing for the heavens to open
21:41 -  and God say mary or whatever precious to have a name and maybe some of us need a new name because the old life and the name that was associated with it there's no longer the distinctive statement of what we now are by the blessing which has come so in some instances
22:02 -  we see the lord do that that's good first john one night he confess our sins the word confessing really means to say the same thing so it's like it's in line with what you're saying about appropriating so for jacob it's like when he says jacob i'm a supplicant i'm a neighbor he's
22:21 -  good saying the same thing that's good yeah the man asked him what is your name and in shock of realization whispering he said
22:35 -  jacob the shock of realization he whispered jacob well whoever wrote that then let's do it good actually the word for the seven point another two things he could have said what are you or who are you i mean that's really getting at who are you what are you
22:54 -  we asked him that man something came to my mind in the first song when davis say against you and you only have our sinned and did that which was evil in your sight i don't think jacob realized that what he had did he had did it against God and now it was God's time to reveal
23:17 -  it is everybody realizing the genius of scripture what kind of a literature the holy lip is mainly very terse you know that word t e r s e very compact very concentrated it's not
23:41 -  uh the kind of writing that men do where it spills out in eloquent descriptions and florid details and lots of exhausting dialogue that we've gone with the wind you have to have a real bow to carry the boat everything is so lean just a few words just a statement nothing
24:02 -  filled in no asterisk at the bottom of the page to explain it it's as if God knew and wanted the interaction between the saints of every generation with the text that he had set forth that it might be for us a basis for discovery because of every detail we're given and it's
24:23 -  just a matter of reading it reading the footnotes and so on we have the complete picture there's nothing that has to be drawn out of us there's nothing transformative for us but because the scripture by its nature is terse compact few words and so he said tell me your name then
24:45 -  we have to ask well why did he say that why couldn't he have done something else if he wanted jacob to reveal his past and understand his sinful condition why is the name enough to open up the whole panoply of jacob's whole past and all of the conniving and scheming that
25:04 -  he had ever done he would see it in a flash when the realization would break upon his heart when he himself speaks the word genka so i'm just saying that that we should come to the scripture with an enhanced appreciation of what its very character is by the determination of God
25:26 -  because if we read it so carefully and shallowly and just follow the line of the action we're going to miss great treasure so not the least of the values of what we're of what we're doing tonight and in these days is to learn new habits of mind and modes of examination of the word of God
25:47 -  syllable by syllable to pose questions why does he say this why why shouldn't he have said that why does he say it at all because everything is so measured from God so after jacob says his name in verse 28 the lord says your name shall no longer be called jacob
26:15 -  but Israel for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed and you know that there are several optional explanations of the meaning of the word Israel a prince who prevails with God and with men is one
26:39 -  one who struggles and prevails it was God himself was given this name it's wonderful to have a name given that contains in it the name of God himself where is that in Israel
27:00 -  where's the name of God in the name Israel Israel that God puts his own name in Israel's name is a remarkable thing
27:14 -  this is not some plucking out of the air of something that will serve the moment this is a deliberate choosing of God because the name is going to be a designation for a people throughout all ages and the people who are not exclusively jewish but will be brought into the
27:33 -  Israel of God because they share the character of that people and the purpose of that people and their call and have had a comparable kind of relationship with the God of that people so this this name is so enormously significant so once and for all that we need to dwell upon it
27:55 -  like that real one that we often talk about you don't just swipe it back like coca-cola you'll let it linger on your tongue have you ever done that and you can feel something dotting on your tongue of a prickly kind i don't know what that is whether it's the alcohol or
28:11 -  what but it's a remarkable sensation and you don't get it from coca-cola or whatever else and then you let that precious fluid slip down and in to your gullet and you can feel the warm feather going down and then it spreads like a blessing in the internet hope i'm not inducing
28:34 -  anybody but that's how men will appreciate a rare and fine wine how ought we to appreciate the word of God taking it into our mouth holding it feeling that pot prickly thing and then slowly letting it sit there your name shall no more be called jacob but Israel
28:58 -  in contrary to the king james version because it seems to expand more in the translation you said and he said thy name shall be called normal no more jacob but Israel for as a prince has our power with God and with men and has prevailed oh as a prince
29:18 -  hey what has that got to do with the identity crisis of being black or anything else that has been submerged or held down or reduced in the world when as a prince you have favor and power with God and with men what need you what need have you for any other identification
29:46 -  to hold your head up and describe this world as a giant and to be comfortable in the world and not in any way ever intimidated by it because as a prince with God you have prepared can you imagine what it means to be the Israel of God and i enjoy that to go in the nations and not in any way ever
30:09 -  to feel intimidated threatened brow beaten by towering skyscrapers by the apparatus of civilization the degrees and titles of men the various things that go into the prestige of this world though we wait we may not have any other credential if you have this credential what other
30:30 -  need have you and it's not an encouragement to arrogance or to being buxom or a hot shot hey i'm a prince with God don't you know it's the kind of thing that you hold quietly in your heart because it is not
30:51 -  something you've earned by your ballot it's something that's been confirmed by his grace but what a thing to be confirmed what a title of prince hallelujah precious nobility if anything has been lost in the shuffle in the hard press of life in being
31:13 -  knocked about and being objects of abuse rape mishandling all the kinds of things of which the people of God in their histories have experienced to come into this place as a daughter and son of Israel of a prince having favor with God with men sublimates all the past that makes it to dissolve
31:34 -  as nothing you can hold your head up you're the worst so this conferring of this name is so unspeakable precious because who knows to what degree jacob's hustling and his cheating and all of that stuff somehow was born out of insecurity because he came second not first you know what
31:57 -  i mean and in Israel in that people before the word Israel came the first one was the one who received the inheritance the first one received from the father's estate the second one the third one got the scraps so to be a first one is elevated celebrated on it and jacob came second
32:20 -  and maybe that put a permanent walk in the man that made him to be driving and i don't want to be too speculative what makes samuel run it is the name of a book a novel that came out some years ago of a jewish guy from the east side of new york the peddlers of the pushcart peddlers and
32:43 -  the poverty who worked his way all the way up to becoming a big ceo and magnet in hollywood a producer sandy but what made sandy run and there's a little episode when he was a boy western union was hiring and he and his brother were online hoping that they would get a job
33:04 -  they were desperately hungry and poverty-stricken and his brother was in front of him as they came close to the table where the interview was conducted he pushed his brother out of the way he said get out of here you jews this is not for you
33:19 -  and he got the job because the man thought that by that act he himself was not jewish and he would not have given that job towards you oh
33:33 -  even as a boy to make a place from so always driven what makes samuel run what makes samuel run is insecurity a lack of confidence in his identity because he never knew God he knew that he was the God of his father's the God of isaac the God of abraham was not his God and until you
33:53 -  know that what real security have you and how many believers are insecure they know but they don't know as they want to know that they are accepted in the beloved when you know that they're saying really know it workplace is there for sense of inferiority self-consciousness
34:14 -  inadequacy if the lord has accepted you in the beloved if he has called you a prince with God and with men of what else shall you be afraid and be concerned God is the answer to the issue of identity and security and i'm not making life of those questions they're deep and whole
34:38 -  generations of men and races of men have been brow beaten and plowed into the earth and their lives have counted for nothing they've never been able to lift their head the closest example today to us would be the american india their rate of suicide and a lot of their death
34:54 -  whether it's on car accidents alcoholism drugs is slow to suicide because there's no sense of dignity self-esteem and i know that there's a whole market playing on that self-esteem thing and the reason that they are is because there's a vacuum in mankind that God intended himself to
35:15 -  supply so this transaction with God and the name that's given mamma mia there's not a word for it this has to be savored you know this has to be enjoyed you have to take this in it's delicious it's rich it's full of remarkable meaning for us all as the Israel of
35:38 -  God it's really nothing short of union with God himself and perhaps that's where we struggle because in trying to find our identity and our our work before God regardless of our culture our race or whatever if we do not come into that place where we have union with God or that is
35:55 -  stored through this perhaps cause not only in the world but the church causes tremendous problems in how we see God and how we see one another and there's a divine relaxation in God that we often struggle with that for years but it's really the issue of are we becoming immune with God
36:11 -  because something about being immune with the messiah that that lifts you above all those women also goes on all your issues because you are one with him and your whole worth and value is found in him because you came from him you're you know you're found in him and i think
36:25 -  probably a lot of years of my life i've seen man and brother and two have a struggle i realized that that perhaps is the ultimate battle that's what the enemy the bottom line he's always waging war with that golden light to either destroy God's character before our eyes or to put a wedge between
36:39 -  our union with God or make us fearful that aware and of course we try to work out with one another on that level and it's always false apart a union is a hint that are including elvin i'm using a bit of imagination here if i'm a firm director trying to summarize this scene in
36:58 -  the struggle how uh initially it was the red thing in the red thing i don't know what you want to do but suppose you want to push away your acceptance and there will be tension in the hand in the finger as they struggle together but when jacob asked the angel to bless him he can just imagine
37:15 -  the change in the tension in the finger he no longer becomes a struggle to push the assassin away but in the night the excellent probably stands for peace talk but loving embrace and you can imagine the tears that probably came at the night as described in oz chapter 12
37:38 -  i think it's a very beautiful picture we're not talking about a small thing here because the great tragedies of modern times have come from nations who have sought to make a name for themselves find a place in the sun to be a master race to bring a thousand year rule to be a nation upon
37:57 -  whom the sun never sets that was japan the sun rises and sets with japan the whole issue of empire acquisition power over inferior peoples has been the whole history of the 20th century so what we're talking about in individuals is equally true in nations nations have
38:19 -  brought great death consequence by their own need to establish themselves and make a name at the expense of others because they don't know God in a way that would have fully placated the need for recognition and for identity so when we speak redeemed Israel shall go forth to the
38:38 -  nations of the world can you imagine what a message there is a message to the nations so i'm telling the church the object of nations is not your baby for you it's a people for his name from among all nations but the object of nations per se as nations is redeemed Israel
39:00 -  they will be the first of nations going to the nations with a message for the nations because they are the living answer to the need of nations that has been the spur of all the kinds of grotesque activity that has almost brought civilization down can you imagine the peace
39:21 -  that follows the shalom of God it's more than just a negotiated peace treaty or a settlement an end of conflict it's the peace that comes when men can let out their breath and i'm home i'm at peace in the inner man i understand
39:43 -  i have God there's no need to strain to fight to compete i can accept what i have from the lord's hand what will the earth be in that day the joy the hills will skip like lands the trees will clap their hands that's where all creation glows and travails waiting for this finance so we're
40:03 -  just catching a little sense of what this will mean when this jacob nation becomes Israel and brings such a message not only verbally but out of the transformation of its own national life and that was God's intention from the first you were to be a witness nation for me for all nations
40:27 -  i was going to set one nation in the midst to show the nations an alternative to their suicidal behavior that the cities were not to be pulverized and firebombed and atom-bombed your name shall no longer be called jacob but Israel where you have struggled with God
40:52 -  and with men and have prevailed you have overcome then jacob asked saying what's your name now tell me your name i hope i can where can i find this
41:12 -  is in one of my commentaries one of these scholars reminds us that in the ancient world they have had a meaning far beyond anything that we can recognize as modern
41:27 -  and to be able to name something was to have a kind of relationship with it or an authority over it but would obtain the benefit from it it's not an accident that God gave adam the first prerogative to name all the other animals and when he named them in that act he established
41:44 -  his own dominion over them name naming something is remarkable so jacob asking what's your name is not just an issue of idle curiosity it's wanting to not only understand something but affect something by the knowledge of that name with the man now with whom he has wrestled and
42:12 -  something else too i think we've underestimated the great depth the great chasm of a fall itself on a whole relationship with God man and struck with the fact that unlike jacob and abraham all these fellows that great men of God who they were they they all possessed what adam did not
42:31 -  fell into and it's just great fear uh i'm struck with the fact that adam did all he did before the fall about fear of confidence uh he was even naked so he was not ashamed there was none of that sense of inferiority of rejection there's something wrong there was none of that because
42:48 -  so we i think we have often miscalculated apart from just the theological systematic arguments of the fall what that did in constitution in terms of relationship of how God how manning manning the song God the fact that as soon as he fell or rebelled the first thing it hit him a sphere
43:04 -  he said i heard the voice of the end guard i was afraid why didn't you be afraid of this guy that you've known who you know is pretty well um and so that whole dynamic of of what man has been since that initial rebellion what we lost is incalculable only only a redeemer the second adam could possibly
43:21 -  restore that boy how many of you think that God was offended and jacob asking that question was that presumptuous was that arrogant who was he to ask the most high what is your name because the next word says and he blessed him there is that a statement that where they were
43:43 -  in a moment of pride more physically or he waited to be asked because that question coming out of jacob's depths released the lord to confer the blessing there he blessed him there and i want to say that he'll bless every man who asks what is your name there in that place because not enough
44:07 -  of us are doing it and many of us assume that we already know but i want to read you a little fragment from psalm 24 who shall ascend the hill of the lord who may stand in his holy place he who has clean hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his
44:29 -  soul to an idol but to idolatry God alternatives most one deceitfully he shall receive blessing from the lord of licenses from the lord of salvation this is jacob the generation of those who seek him who seek your face does anybody have anything after who seek your face
44:59 -  the play on jacob the seeking of God's face as being the capstone of those who ascend the hill of God some basic things are required or else you may not even take the first step up clean hands you've not given your hands over to fiddling with the tv knob or worse pure heart free
45:21 -  from deceit one who has not gone after idolatry you've not made sport or money or anything like that a God substitute but the capstone is the one who receives the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the God of salvation the generation of those who seek him who seek
45:42 -  thy face oh God of jacob seeking God is a lost art you know that there are few seekers and few ascendants of the holy hill because at that holy hill there's a gate and behind it is the lord himself the king of glory and it says lift up your heads in verse seven though your gates will be lifted
46:12 -  up your everlasting Gods and the king of glory shall come in kalbar says the king of glory has bound himself waiting for someone who can come and throw the bolt that opens the gate to allow the king of glory to come in someone who can ascend the hill who has the clean hands and the
46:33 -  pure heart is free from idolatry and who has sought Gods who has sought God and sought his face is this near recognition or are there two stages or phases of seeking God there's a seeking of God but there's a seeking of God's face which is ultimate because his face itself is the ultimate
46:58 -  statement of God as he in fact is in himself we how shall we say it modern believers have not sought the lord we're not sought God we're satisfied with minimal understanding sufficient for our purposes but the real seeking of God that is the seeking of God
47:25 -  goes beyond your purposes beyond your need and beyond your benefit it's the seeking of God which is the seeking of God for his own sake because he's God jacob said tell me your name that must have melted the world's heart he wasn't just wanting the piece of information name rank and
47:47 -  cereal when he's saying is your name if if my new name is the designation of what i am by your grace what is your name the designation of what are you what is your character your name will reveal it because it's in your name that's why when God tells erin how to bless the children of
48:08 -  Israel uh save this unto them uh how's it going the your confidence shine make your confidence to shine upon us thus he says you shall put my name upon the children of Israel zion is the place that i've reserved as the sanctuary for my name i have placed my name there
48:33 -  the name of the lord itself is a high tower and a place to run in all right it appears that this is what was on the lord's heart because you mentioned this texture in and just 32 where jacob asked me please tell me your name but the lord before he said any blessing there then the lord says to him
48:52 -  why is it that you asked my name he's wanting to know what's your motivation and then he blesses him now we're not doing any more there but apparently must have been some expression in jacob that that when the lord asked him why is it you asked my name uh one of the other
49:08 -  patriarchs in the scriptures i think was satan's parents uh they asked the same thing in the words why do you ask my name since it is incomprehensible you know i was thinking that is the very desire to ask that was as a result of the struggle that they were
49:28 -  that it wasn't right somehow the struggle uh and and jacob and God or jacob and and the angel or the intimacy breath to breath or however that was brought about a need for the awareness of who is this
49:53 -  i was thinking also that norah was also a statement of the change of the character of jacob but in the description of connoisseur gave us that once the the actual battle has been fought and that obviously there was a noticeable change within jacob for his change of character
50:10 -  that he then God's desire to have that intimacy with jacob it was designed to have with Israel today so there's that recognition within jacob there's this need what it's like what is your name that's like i'm seeking God like there's this embrace the kind of like the reconciliation
50:24 -  of the garden of even though most people like to do that you know what i mean of course for God to give him his name to answer that by giving him his name is more than supplying a piece of information he's supplying himself he's he's giving a revelation and the awareness of what this God is
50:45 -  and it'll be our reward also but it will require the rest of it it will require a being all along the lord's not going to make himself available he's not going to be a convenience that we could fold in because we have an extra few minutes
50:59 -  he's waiting to see how ruthless we will be to be alone to separate ourselves away from distraction and to give ourselves exclusively and intently into seeking his face oh God of jacob that we might know that there's a nuance here i think that you can appreciate when they got
51:18 -  asked please tell me your name if we really in the life of that uh so it's not like please tell me your name but yeah we could go with this yeah realization of the God God is this person
51:35 -  the realization from jacob of the struggle that he's had and the emotional response that once he realized especially because it comes after that the new name he's given to him then there's that new kind of relationship that God was before that then there's a red thing then there's God
51:53 -  giving him the new name and then the realization of what a gracious holy but also a loving God a father is God absolutely in the light of all this what would you say at the new test of the scripture whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved is that a little glib cheap
52:10 -  formula that you're just in the name of Jesus isn't that the way we treat that we make it a little genie that in the name of Jesus we respect the results but we need to reference that name whoso shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved because that very calling implies a
52:30 -  recognition of who is that God and what is in that name which is the which is being saved in itself you know what i mean if you come with a disrespect that the name is only a formula you'll not get an answer not only for the salvation from sin and from death
52:46 -  but the salvation for whatever the crisis that's before you now whatever the need is now we need to be saved again and again and again there are situations and predictions that we face daily and God is waiting to be called upon who's also called upon my name what does that mean
53:02 -  who knows what my name represents that i'm a deliverer that i'm faithful that i'm i'm all powerful that there's nothing too difficult for me that i'm a God who hears you and i i'm able and will answer you that is when you call on the name with that kind of recognition that kind of faith
53:20 -  you'll get that kind of salvation oh good that's his last and his final cruise
54:08 -  the angel of the lord is within me from where he goes isn't this a actually a a pattern for true salvation the wrestling with God that the change of jacob before he wrestles with God and the change of nature and the the first
54:25 -  outward sign of that change is the way he treats his enemy he thought they actually come to himself i see a kind of a pattern for true salvation is the way that that the lord kind of designated rather than as you describe it this kind of easy come salvation is presented today there is really
54:41 -  no wrestling with God itself it's just come give your life to lord and not to go and here's about a little bit just put it another way to say unless a man's salvation or conversion has some relationship to these rudimentary things how say this unless there's been a wrestling less
55:02 -  there's been a recognition unless there's been a calling on the bestowing of the name how safe are we how converted are we and wrestling is at the heart of it i think it goes to the to the work design of day 43 to where it says
55:18 -  oh jacob i have created little Israel i have formed another dichotomy that was just created and that was formed that was impressed through that was you know what i see this experience jacob is being prepped being changed being you know imagine a created being in one of these
55:37 -  he's been formed good and now maybe we can appreciate the phrase and the sun rose upon jacob in verse 31 i've seen God face to face my life is preserved just as he crossed over by the way crossing over is the root of the of the of the word hebrew as he crossed over
56:07 -  henuel which means the face of God the sun rose on him and he lived on his head so we have two things we have night and we have the sun rising on jacob it didn't say the sun came up it said the sun rose on him it's more than just a description at six a.m it means that the
56:30 -  man now who had lived in the darkness of of the conniving and skullduggery and and cheating is now walking in a new life the sun rose upon him you can even spell son s o n something has come upon him and he's coming into a whole new dimension and new work the lord the lord
56:59 -  Jesus speaking oh righteous father the world knew thee not but i knew thee and these knew that thou didst tell me and i make known unto them thy name and will make it known that the love wherewith thou lovest me maybe and then and i and so there's a name and a knowing of
57:21 -  the discredibility for those you can perceive that impartation of his love again and through that remember what joseph was called at the beginning of that book God boasts on him he says to the bellow have you seen my servant joe there's not another like him on the face of the earth
57:40 -  who is upright who eschews evil he spurns evil a couple of the rest of it such as a designation of a superb man in God but at the end of the book of joe we hear out of joseph's own lips i've heard of you by the hearing of my ear but now my eyes see it and i abhor myself and repent
58:01 -  in dust and ashes what a statement of a man who so exceeds anything that we know spirituality or rectitude that God can boast on him at the beginning of the book must have had some relationship with God that God could say those things of him across to him but at the end
58:21 -  of the book but he passes through all of that travail and suffering and wrestles out all of these questions with his so-called confidants and finally comes the final revelation of the lord who art thou oh man you know have you seen what i've created in this uh what's the name of that
58:41 -  sea creature its scales are violent the violence and its scales are impenetrable you can't put a hook in it you can't you know there's nothing for me when you're there when i when i lay out the earth and its foundations have created this i've heard of you by the hearing of my ear
59:00 -  but now my i see it and i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes so there's a seeing and a seeing and a knowing and a knowing and if the great joe comes to a confession of this kind at the end of the book and admits that i didn't know as i'd love to know now i'm beginning to
59:19 -  glimpse you and the result of it is i want to go six feet under i don't even deserve to be on the same earth with you but under it not because i've done wickedly but just what i am is a clot as a piece of earth as a man my iniquity is ever before me as david said now that i've seen you as you are
59:41 -  so what's imperative for the Israel of God to be the Israel of God today who shall make him known in these last days and move to jealousy the people who are yet to come into the meaning of their own name and call but this knowledge this realization of God in his name by those who will seek him
01:00:08 -  by those who will seek him and seek thy face oh God of him i'm really impressed here with i want to be careful with technology but this jake was such a beautiful singular technology of the Israel who at the end of the age will return limping
