The Fullness of the Gentiles

00:00 -  Paul speaks of the subject as a mystery. He says one that he would not have us through the ignorance lest we become wise in our own conceit. It's the only penalty that I know that Paul has cited in a failure to apprehend a mystery in
00:20 -  God and that that penalty is presently being paid, has been paid historically by and I'm so bold as to say that probably every malfunction, every want in the present church, every lamentable aspect of its present condition over which some
00:41 -  of us grieve is to be attributed in the last analysis to the failure to have understood or apprehended this mystery. And you can even fail in that while at the same time having an affinity for the present state of Israel and even for the
01:00 -  Jewish people. That is no assurance that you have laid hold of the mystery. It might well in fact even constitute an impediment to the apprehension of it. So this is beyond our categories. The Israel that is mentioned in our topic and title
01:16 -  and the church are two realities not yet present and they will not be present until God's intention for both the church and Israel is fulfilled. The church is not the church till it recognizes its destiny with this particular people and
01:37 -  Israel will not be the Israel of God until it receives the grace and mercy that God will extend through one agent only the salvific role of the church toward Israel in the last days. That's a preliminary statement for which I'm
01:57 -  already panting. So the great chapter or the great book is Romans, the great section of Paul's treatment, the genius of what he is as an apostle is summed up in the three great chapters 9 through 11 and every time I encounter those who
02:19 -  are unappreciative of the mystery or think that somehow God has finished with Israel invariably it's because they have failed to consult these three chapters and especially chapter 11 and even reading it there's no guarantee that
02:38 -  you're going to receive it because the mystery can only be apprehended through revelation. So when Paul calls us not to be ignorant of the mystery he calls us in that same breath to a certain spiritual condition and posture and
02:57 -  disposition alone by which the mystery can be revealed. If there's an arrogance, a conceit, a pride, something in us that we may not even be able to identify that is somehow caustic or demeaning or unappreciative of Jews of Israel that
03:18 -  will serve effectively to block any prospect of that revelation being communicated or received. So much hinges on the truth of the church's condition even so much as to receive the mystery, the revelation of the mystery what then
03:36 -  shall we say shall be required to fulfill it and the answer is everything. The issue of Israel is the making or breaking of the church. It is impossible to be the church in any apostolic meaning of that word and yet the unrelated
03:57 -  and unconscious unaware of this great mystery by which the church itself is defined. So I've been looking over a wonderful manuscript today that has come into my hands very scholarly, academic, precious and I've made some comments in the
04:19 -  margins of some of the points that are raised as this scholar takes up some of the things that I've already cited that I think the Lord wanted to feed in to my consideration for you tonight. This author puts a great deal of weight on Paul's encounter with the risen Christ
04:47 -  on the road to Damascus. A man who was the avowed enemy of that heresy subsequently to be called Christianity and was on his way to see to the destruction of this heretical entity was apprehended by the risen Lord. There's no way to begin
05:11 -  to appreciate how God encounters Paul but somehow today for the first time I recognized that only if we also are encountered by that revelation of God we cannot begin to apprehend the things that were set in motion for Paul by the coming together with himself and the Christ
05:37 -  whom he was persecuting. That there has to be an appearing of the Lord. There needs to be some kind of a revealing. If we know the Lord or about the Lord doctrinally or have a correct body of doctrine and have not had encounter of the kind that brought Paul to the earth and occasioned
06:02 -  his blindness we're not likely to see the thing that was shown him and of which he is the author in the great book of Romans. Everything goes back to that initial encounter with the risen Christ. As I have preached on that subject in times past the one thought that I'm
06:22 -  kindled in my spirit tonight is that though he was an enemy of God and a persecutor of the church the virtue I think that God recognized and released him to confront Paul was that he was journeying. He was on his way. He was in motion and in movement and even though in error the Lord
06:48 -  recognized the intensity of his heart and that he was a man moving from one place to another in what he fought was service to God. And we who are resting on our knees and are comfortable in our correct doctrine and have given up journeying and don't recognize that there's an ever an
07:10 -  onward progression of an apostolic kind to which we are called are not likely to be encountered by that same Christ. Paul's journeying was critical to his being apprehended even though he was journeying in error and as I've said in times past there's more hope for a man in error in motion
07:30 -  and journeying toward what he believes to be significant for God than those who are correct and stationary and dormant and fixed. The remarkable thing is that of all of the apostolic figures of the early church who is better fitted to be the apostle to the circumcision than Paul,
07:51 -  the prized student of the rabbi Gamaliel and such a rabbinical candidate himself so instructed so informed as he himself says Pharisee of the Pharisees, Hebrew of the Hebrews and yet have you ever pondered that almost in the face of those qualifications God sets them aside and makes him to
08:12 -  be the apostle to the circumcision and to the Gentiles. How do we understand that? It seems like a lavish and extravagant waste of an extraordinarily gifted man whose talent, ability, knowledge would have been such an asset in the witness of the gospel to his own Jewish people
08:34 -  not that Paul neglected them wherever he was in the promoting of the gospel to the nations he always sought for the Jews first but his primary task as an apostle is to the Gentiles that seems to defy all of our categories but if we plumb that and probe that it will begin to
08:58 -  open the mystery for if God's ultimate intention is the restoration of Israel in the last days to a church that is essentially Gentile and have come into the faith through those space made by the branches broken off from their tree that they might move Israel to jealousy
09:20 -  that he would use his best instrument in ministry to the church for the ministry to the church is ultimately and in the last analysis the ministry to the Jew in the most significant sense. Can you follow that and if that was true for Paul is it not equally true for us
09:43 -  that our own effectiveness even to the world and to the nations and to our locality somehow is related to and hinges upon whether we ourselves have recognized the centrality and the priority of the Jew so Paul is more than just some idiosyncratic
10:04 -  statement of God's dealing with a man Paul is a paradigm Paul is a template Paul is give me another word a a prototype who said that good for you I'll see you outside after the service for a big hug Paul is the prototype of the church itself and nothing about his circumstance from the point of
10:32 -  his opposition to the faith his radical apprehension by Christ on the road to Damascus and his subsequent preparation training and use there is without enormous significance to ourselves who are called also by the chief apostle to be ourselves apostolic
10:51 -  so no way to come into that identity the church that is not apostolic as so many have heard me say over and over through the years is no longer the church it's some kind of religious entity a cultural phenomenon something that brings services and modicum of benefit to men but it's
11:11 -  not the church in the apostolic sense that has a destiny that we that calls for ultimate fulfillment the ultimate knowledge of God the ultimate apprehension of his resurrection life and that key is for us what it was also for Paul the centrality of Israel and that's the heart of
11:32 -  Paul's message in the book of Romans which he calls a mystery so we need to see it so we need to see it and and take it into our deeps or we will fail in our own identity and any possibility of the
11:52 -  fulfillment for which Paul gave himself and the end result of our failure to see to be apprehended and to establish this priority is to make ourselves a commonplace to make ourselves a Christian culture
12:11 -  and there's plenty of that everywhere about us and the issue with success or how it benefits men or brings blessing or provides programs is not what is the subject that I'm wanting to put before you there's a destiny there's a calling that begins with Paul which is equally ours
12:31 -  it has been historically neglected ignored lost or rejected there's something in the essential gentile heart of the Christian church that does not have much disposition even to consider that there's a prospect of glory for the people Israel a consummation and a restoration
12:52 -  to the purposes to which they were called from the very beginning a nation of priests and a light unto the world that the gifts and colleagues of God are irrevocable that he has set them aside for a season that has opened the door to salvation to the gentiles through
13:13 -  their momentary being set aside but that is not that we should enjoy our salvation upon ourselves and think in any way that we have replaced them but that our salvation is for them as well as for ourselves for in the very first verses of the question that Paul is answering
13:35 -  to the Roman church is God finished with the Jew with Israel Paul says God forbid that you should think that for their stumbling in the language that he uses their momentary falling away is that salvation has come to you so that you might move them to jealousy from the very
13:57 -  first statement Paul is indicating a reciprocal relationship between Israel even in its apostate and fallen state and those that have come now newly into the faith through the room made for them through the setting aside of Israel it's a mystery dear saints we've got God give the grace to
14:21 -  understand this reciprocal thing from which we cannot extricate ourselves we're locked in with them and they with us and they will not be with God intense for them nor we ourselves in our calling as the church except in the recognition and the taking to heart of the mystery of this
14:43 -  reciprocity it's really a remarkable thing that Jesus in his own ministry went to the worship of the house of Israel he did a gentile woman a favor by allowing her to take up the crumbs that fall from the table of his own people but his ministry was to Israel to the nation to
15:06 -  his own now we see Paul who is the continuation of the life of the high priest and the apostle of our confession completely controverting what was the stratagem of Jesus Jesus went exclusively to Israel Paul goes almost exclusively to the church it's not a man who is ignorant of what
15:31 -  the call of Jesus was and his ministry but it indicates to us that a profound shift has taken place with the rise of the apostolic church and the fulfillment of the mystery now that must exceed Israel and go beyond it and into the nations so that ultimately Israel will be the
15:49 -  benefit to the nations for the call of God that Abraham was that you will be a blessing to all the families of the earth there's so much here there's so much that seems to contradict logic reason principles Paul differing from Jesus in his emphasis
16:11 -  and even differing in what was the historic anticipation of those who knew the Hebrew scriptures that the nations as I've already cited would receive salvation and the knowledge of Israel's God through the ministry of Israel to the nations how then is God reversing the order
16:29 -  and saying that Israel will not come first but come last first comes the church first comes the ministry into the nations of the people for his name from among all nations and through them comes the restoration of Israel that it might be to the all the ends of the earth with God intense there's
16:47 -  a remarkable shift of the profoundest kind with the advent of Paul and the apostolic church which after his passing is increasingly lost to the church until we come to our present day in which this is little known nor understood and needs to be restored
17:07 -  and I'm saying that the failure to see it and to take it to heart and to walk consciously in it will so affect us as the church as to render us not only non-apostolic but only another aspect of the contemporary Christian culture that is to be found everywhere that teach that touches neither
17:26 -  Israel nor the nations that even a people for his name from among all nations the world the global mission of the church is inextricably tied in with the mystery of God's restoration of Israel for Paul says in the same book of chapter 11 of Romans that when the fullness of the gentiles
17:50 -  be come in so all Israel shall be saved as it is written how many people have are hearing this for the first time everyone's familiar let me repeat this remarkably critical statement and so when the fullness of the gentiles be come in all Israel shall be saved
18:14 -  as it is written Romans 11 25 I do not desire brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should become wise in your own conceit or your own opinion that blindness or hardening in part has happened to Israel until it's a wonderful until it's not a permanent
18:36 -  hardening it's not a permanent blindness it will cease their eyes will be opened and they're calling restored and fulfilled when when the fullness of the gentiles be come in it has nothing to do with Israel's virtue with Israel's stature with its own inheritance or heritage or religious ability
19:01 -  these things might be the very impediment to the fulfillment it has everything to do with gentiles the issue of Israel is not Israel the issue of Israel is the gentile church when its fullness shall come in so all Israel shall be saved as it is written
19:23 -  the deliverer will come out of Zion and will turn away on governance from Jacob for this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins so we have every reason to take this so deeply to heart because the issue of Israel is the issue of God as no other issue
19:42 -  the issue of his promise and his fulfillment of their restoration their return through his deliverance out of Zion is the issue of what is written and the issue of the covenant that I have made with them should God fail in this there's no recovery it's an enduring permanent loss the whole
20:05 -  God has all of his eggs in one basket the issue of his name his glory his honor rests upon the fulfillment of what he gives Paul to speak of those things that shall come to place in the last days when the fullness of the gentiles shall be come in I think in some translations they say the number
20:25 -  of the gentiles I like the word fullness better because there are dimensions to this mystery that have more to do with that than just the number of gentiles that shall come to the Lord through the ministry of the church through its global missions but there's a fullness that God
20:47 -  is waiting for that is not only numerical but qualitative and that has everything to do with the kind of Christian culture understanding and mentality that we ourselves seek or obtain so long as we ourselves remain as gentiles and lack the Hebraic dimensions of the faith
21:11 -  the fullness that God is wanting in the salvation that is it that is all-inclusive that goes so beyond the salvation merely from sin however great that is that fullness is yet waiting and I'm just how do I say this this is an educated opinion it's not a thus saith the Lord
21:33 -  Paul himself does not give us an asterisk and a footnote to explain what he means by fullness but I'm taking the liberty to suggest that there are dimensions for which God waits that has to do with more than the numeric quantity of those who come to the faith in the nations it has to do
21:54 -  with the character and the quality and the mode of being and the reality and what what that body expresses and manifests and that to which it has come through its salvation for the deliverance that comes out of Zion is more than just a geographical location maybe I'll speak on this
22:15 -  tomorrow night but a deliverance that comes out of a condition out of a witness out of something that moves the Jews to jealousy out of something that they never expect to see expressed through a gentile church that is so overwhelming so moving that the historic resistance to the gospel for
22:36 -  which they have been enemies Paul says for our sake is overcome the dimensions of this are staggering and if it requires all this much how then ought the church to see this in its significance and give itself consciously to the
22:56 -  fulfillment of its own calling that cannot be obtained except in the conscious recognition in the conscious recognition of the centrality of that people and its destiny because it's the issue of what is written and the covenant that I have made with them show me the church that is
23:20 -  indifferent to God's ability to fulfill his own covenant or to honor what he has written and I'll show you an apostate church so a very jealousy for the name of God and his honor his word and his covenant keeping power rests with the fulfillment of this mystery and his faith is so
23:41 -  great that he believes that it's going to be fulfilled through the church that is raised up through the nations that is essentially gentile and therefore has every historic reason not only to be indifferent to the fate of the Jews but even to be opposed to them because there's something
23:58 -  intrinsic in being gentile and being Jewish that has served for the clash and friction resentment irritation jealousy anger fear that has marked the history of these peoples since time immemorial to overcome gentileness in a way so as to be able to relate to this people lovingly
24:22 -  even in their hostility even in their anger even in their pride or arrogance even in their disdain for the church requires of us and a special disposition a quality of maturity of authentic spirituality of which they are the test if we have any other index to the success of ourselves as
24:45 -  Christians that omits their ability to be affected by us unto jealousy we have the wrong criteria and therefore we will suffer by the wrong measure however much we succeed in those categories you see what it takes to proclaim a mystery you have to choke and splurt your way through
25:09 -  you so I'm trusting God to fill in between the spaces and between the lines and communicate the sense of the magnitude of this mystery that you would have to say with Paul himself who is sufficient for these things
25:30 -  and as I often say I can bet dollars to donuts that I'm looking at entire congregations of God's people who are however long in the faith who have never yet had occasion once to cry out with any sense of desperate urgency who is sufficient for these things because we are
25:50 -  for everything issue other than Israel we are sufficient but when it comes to the issue of the Jew and the historic enmity against this faith if you can only be in my shoes in my weekly meeting with an orthodox rabbi of the fifth generation who is the graduate of free yeshivot at seminaries
26:13 -  in Israel canada and the united states who carries the niv bible and is informed and instructed and deep and and catch some sense of his hostility toward our lord and our faith you you understand why Paul rightly says they are the enemies of the gospel and then as Paul often does punctuates
26:36 -  that statement by something yet more staggering for your sake we need an enemy like that dear saints or we will be below par we will be complimenting and congratulating ourselves for something that doesn't even desire deserve any kind of recognition but when they when we are
26:57 -  opposed by this people in their intellectuality in their learning in their piety in their devoutness as i was sharing with my host or the pastor somewhere today and since my arrival i had the privilege of staying at the home of this dear rabbi and the next morning early about
27:19 -  7 a.m he's with his son 10 years old with whom he meets every day to go over a page of the talmud and that day's selection seemed to me so esoteric it had to do with flower offerings that are no longer extent there's no temple no sacrifice and here's the kid memorizing the
27:42 -  mishnah he's memorizing the oral law now codified that has to do with a statement on how this flower offering is to be made how it's to be mixed with water and various details that seem utterly superfluous let them to lay them on a 10-year-old boy who should be out shooting marbles or whatever
28:02 -  10-year-old boys do now i was privileged to sit in on this remarkable thing and to observe the discipline of that household who are even now as i shared with my hostess today eating their meals not in their kitchen or dining room but in the basement why because we are approaching the
28:22 -  Passover season and they have already scoured the house for hummus for leaven and they've gone from the attic right through to the kitchen and to make sure that no new leaven will be introduced everything is reduced now to the basement where they're eating until pesach begins and before
28:41 -  that begin beginning there's one last search for hummus one last search for leaven in which they begin with candles and go under the beds and in nooks and crannies and corners and then he said we use flashlights and i said what about the children oh they're with us in this they're
28:56 -  excited they can't wait for this occasion it's exciting to cleanse the house from hummus to prepare for the greatness of the pesach of the Passover the great festival that we are enjoying to keep throughout all our posterity oh you dear saints i'm a believer almost 40 years and i moved
29:16 -  to jealousy by their piety by their devoutness by their exemplary discipline by the order of their homes and that the rabbi's defense of requiring a 10-year-old child to memorize a portion of the Mishnah and to follow with his father in dialogue over a page of the Talmud in
29:36 -  some esoteric practice that is no longer being performed is that it's the law and that there's virtue in studying the law and how dare we even approach the scriptures until our minds and hearts have been fitted through the discipline that comes to us in the study of the law and its observance
29:58 -  compare that to the slack slovenly indolent easy come easy go character of our church and you'll see ironically who's moving who to jealousy so i'm count myself privileged for the lord having moved me to new york now and this is a rare
30:17 -  speaking for me i'm not in the speaking mode i'm in the receiving mode i'm learning God is exposing me the same brother took me to the yeshiva in new jersey where he lives 3 000 men most of whom are married in great study halls where you one-on-one bent over these books in in deep interactive
30:41 -  intensity plumbing and probing and examining such things as we would not give a moment's consideration and they with such avid intensity as if the very issues of life and truth hang on some esoteric small issue of a principle of the law
31:01 -  and these are the people that that were called to move the jealousy what that by what demonstration so the lord has really stacked the cards and he chooses the foolish and the weak thing and he takes those who are least fitted for whom jews are contemptuous and says through you
31:24 -  through the zion that you are and represent their deliverance will come when your fullness is when the when your fullness when your gentileness has come to a fullness by which your gentile essential makeup has been altered radically and has become
31:39 -  hebraicized when you can show to them the genius of what it means to hebraic to be hebraic though not having been born jewish but have come to it through the life in God and through your spiritual apprehension of the reality of God and have come to it together and corporately as a people called
31:59 -  the church the lord will be at the door and and the deliverance will come out of zion and Paul says that the falling away of them in romans 11 has been the blessing of the gentiles what shall their return be but life from the death so Paul in using the word mystery
32:24 -  is is quite appropriate in touching the magnitude of this so great issue for the church for it's the whole drama of salvation it's the saga of salvation it's the saga of redemption for which we don't even have an appropriate word in english but God bless the german theologians
32:44 -  they have the word and that word is heils the germans have a word of the all-inclusive saga of redemption that begins with adam and concludes with the restoration of Israel it's one long unbroken continuum of the great work of God in the earth the raising of the church the nation fallen
33:06 -  into apostasy and into judgment and yet again to suffer a final time of judgment and an expulsion in flight and the mercy that will be extended through the church and the bringing back of a remnant again to the lord and to the land heils the shifter the history of salvation there's a
33:25 -  saga s a g a i even have to spell it because i'm not sure that you know it or you're familiar with it because frankly what is there in our present life that has anything to do with a saga with a great redemptive drama with greatness itself and for the want of our preoccupation with this holy
33:48 -  context we're going to star wars and looking for dubious amusements of an exciting kind because we do not have it in our faith we do not consciously see ourselves as caught up with God in a remarkable saga of redemption that is coming to its conclusion in the last days through the instrumentality of a
34:12 -  church of an apostolic and prophetic kind which we are called to be even in kansas maybe especially in kansas because everything about your beautiful locality enures one against these realities you have almost to fight and to contend to believe that
34:31 -  what is in these scriptures is the definitive statement of God of what is real you have to contend for the faith once and for all given the saints that calls us to this great redemptive drama we've got to see it we've got to embrace it consciously and willingly for once we do it
34:51 -  touches every aspect of our life and our being it touches how we see each other how we understand the church it's no more the casual coming together of believers who sit near one another for the enjoyment of a service it's people consciously joined in the fulfillment of something
35:12 -  beyond any single saint's capacity and that can only be obtained corporately where true corporateness has been established through suffering the church that has not come through it through suffering has not come to it well you don't come to this by a slap on the back
35:32 -  and high brother and sister in the foyer of the church you come to it through disappointment anguish of heart betrayal misunderstanding confusion accusation and every kind of thing of which saints themselves are capable and will express when they're brought into the extraordinary
35:49 -  intensity of relationship that God intends as normative for the church as the church and only the reality that comes out of that can begin to fit us for the destiny that is ours toward that people but we will not be willing for that suffering church as a suffering before
36:08 -  the glory unless we consciously understand that it's a means to a greater end this mystery must be understood it must be sought it must be received that it will temper and affect our every consideration and make us willing to bear the kind of suffering that is intrinsic to the
36:27 -  church that is the church this is the context of the faith the great drama the saga of redemption Israel's restoration in the last days because of the God who spoke a God who has made covenant a God of whom it is written he says of Paul a well-trained jewish theologian like him who was
36:54 -  in the habit of substantiating a theological conviction or religious religious act from the scriptures it is not much more plausible to think that for the truly revolutionary decision to participate in the gentile mission he began immediately to think through its theological
37:12 -  and salvational implications and to seek its scriptures in its scriptures its justification you'll have to hear this again on the tape this is a christian scholar speaking about Paul confronted by the risen christ on the road to damascus and being blinded by the light of that so great
37:30 -  revelation brighter than the noonday sun and there's a degree to which i'm saying he's our prototype in our model are we willing to be so apprehended as we are on the way journeying by so great a light that blinds us even to the things that we hold now as true but we do not hold them
37:48 -  as true enough we hold them as doctrinally true we hold them as phraseologically true but we don't hold them in the kind of a truth that would qualify us to be modest for it there needs to be an apprehension by which we're first willing to be made blind that we might see
38:07 -  so all of Paul's history with God as i've said is more than just the idiosyncratic dealings of God with a man it's the prototype it's the pattern it's the design of God for the church we need to be blinded in order to see and neither celebrate present Israel or to have an
38:24 -  affinity for jews because we think they're cute or we have a disposition is not the fulfillment of the mystery it might well be the very thing to which we need to be blinded that keeps us from the seeing of the of the very true thing because we much prefer something cozy something familiar
38:43 -  something comfortable something sentimental and something apostolic what this man is saying about Paul that he's a trained jewish theologian who is in the habit of substantiating theological convictions from the scriptures is that your habit
39:02 -  is that our habit to substantiate theological claims by conferring in the scriptures are we trained are we thoughtful do we exercise our minds or are we thinly indoctrinated shallowly inducted into things that are true but for us they're not true enough until they become
39:23 -  as true for for us as it was for Paul how shall we move them to jealousy we've got to do thinking we've got to consider the great things over which Paul himself pondered we have to consider Paul of whom peter himself said difficult to be understood whom whose son rests in their
39:44 -  confusion to their own destruction as they also do the scriptures Paul himself requires of us an exertion that many of us are not disposed to make hallelujah's go along with the program but don't break your head don't don't wrestle with these things don't spit out your guts
40:05 -  don't ponder the same scripture over and over again don't try to understand how it is that jews who have no knowledge of christ and are ostensibly therefore at arm's length with the salvation of God seem to exhibit when you walk into their great synagogues at 770 eastern parkway
40:24 -  and watch a thousand men with prayer shawls over their heads facing the altar of God and and the torah and and governing and bending and prevailing in certain intensity that is beyond religion how do you reconcile that how do we understand that
40:42 -  i'm wrestling with such questions presently but we need to wrestle Paul did it because from the very inception of his call after the revelation of the risen christ he's told that i'm going to send you to gentiles and to kings and to nations Paul would have to ask
41:04 -  is that a calling for men like myself a pharisee of the pharisees that i should go to the gentiles right away something is established of a staggering and contradictory kind that requires Paul to do his homework to understand how it is that the nation Israel that's supposed to bring
41:21 -  salvation to the to the gentiles is now to wait for salvation that will come to it through gentiles before it can be a blessing for all the families of the earth he's got to go back again and search the scriptures and this writer talks about Paul considering isaiah's call and that his own
41:38 -  apprehension on the road to damascus was somewhat paralleled to what isaiah saw of the lord high and lifted up that that isaiah received the revelation of the lord in his enthronement and that though that is not specifically indicated in the descriptions of Paul's encounter in the book of acts
42:00 -  three times that this author is suspecting that something of the same kind came to to Paul that the revelation came from an enthroned christ and that the issue of enthronement the issue of throne is the issue of government is the issue of kingdom is the issue of glory of God and that
42:20 -  every revelation that's got to do with God's purposes and radical calling has got to be set an issue from the throne and the great omission in our own christian understanding is that very thing we do not understand we do not believe we do not expect a kingdom of a very real and political
42:39 -  governing kind over the earth so the scripture says the government shall be upon his shoulder and the angel said to mary that he will sit upon the throne of his father david and rule over the house of of Israel forever but the issue of rule and government is somehow absent
42:57 -  from our consideration and to the degree that it is we have not the context in which the subject of Israel is to be seen and to be understood the issue of Israel is the issue of the kingdom of God it's a davidic kingdom where he will be seated upon the throne of david and out of zion
43:16 -  shall go forth the law and the word of the lord out of rusland to all nations you dear saints haven't you uh trembled over that in these immediate days as you see the looting and the ravaging and the and the whole uh what's the word lawlessness anarchy that is pervading iraq no
43:38 -  control and everyone is taking what he can lay his hands on and though they may complement this for the for the time in removing the dread dictator how long will it be before we will be their victims and how shall shall that dread dictator be replaced and what kind of governing uh entity
43:58 -  shall be established and through whom the issue of government is is mind-breaking and enough to stir us to cry come lord Jesus come not to bring us escape but come to establish your rule for until you rule there's no righteousness in the earth and men will continue to loot and rape and
44:18 -  destroy and torture and perform all of the acts against your creation that they have with impunity come and rule let your fear come over the nations let it be known that there's a centerpiece out of which your wisdom your benevolent understanding your great heart of knowledge and wisdom that
44:38 -  is no way to be compromised by self-interest will be the base and and the root of all rule out of zion when Israel shall be restored to its God and to its nation and to its land we don't understand that we don't have the very context in which the remarkable subject of Israel is to be considered
45:00 -  and the fact of the matter is that we are not kingdom conscious we are not kingdom expectant and therefore every other petty kingdom is having his field day with us to denominations to the ministry of men and to their institutions that bear their own names if we'll not have the king
45:19 -  and not anticipate and seek his kingdom every miniature and self-seeking self-aggrandizing corruption of kingdom will take place through men even in the church thy kingdom come in earth as it is in heaven is the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples and to which we must
45:40 -  be restored this is truly revolutionary the writer says and i write here if we don't see it our calling is truly revolutionary we will become trite t-r-i-t-a there's no alternative there's no halfway house we're either going to be caught up in a great revolutionary endeavor a saga
46:08 -  of a remarkable sweeping time at whose consummation we are at the threshold or we will fall into something less than other that invariably becomes trite predictable religious the issue of Israel rightly understood is the issue of the church
46:29 -  they wrote here in the margin it was for the want of this in the christian church in germany that gave hitler his opportunity to commend a thousand-year rule he gave to germany a vista or a vision of something large that the german hearts rightly craved but it had not to do with
46:49 -  a christian fulfillment but with a political nazi kind it was an apocalyptic vision of a thousand-year rule by a master race it was a perverse expression of the kinds of anticipation that we should have rightly in the coming of the king and have not and in that vacuum hitler gave
47:10 -  a perverse and satanic alternative the church cannot afford to be without the framework of understanding that God intends as normative or it will open the door to every devious spirit of deception and power that if it came and took possession of the great nation
47:29 -  germany need we think that it would have any obstruction here and if it overcame the land of girder and and schiller and bombs and bethoven and Wagner and the great giants of philosophy and science and poetry and art music will it have a difficulty in overcoming the shallowness of our
47:50 -  culture unless there's a church of an absolute of an apostolic kind that is fitted by its taking up the remarkable revolutionary calling that has to do with Israel and therefore is made keen in its discernment to recognize these devious spirits and to and to keep them even out from a nation
48:10 -  because it's bringing to the nation a sense of destiny that God intends for all nations and of which the church in its prophetic call is a voice if we are if we have become less than that if we're just a trite and predictable in-house phenomenon of providing something that we enjoy
48:30 -  and have no effect in the civilization and the society in which we are set we will bring and allow to come into our nation exactly what a defunct church brought to pass in germany and the end of it was the systematic annihilation of six million jews
48:46 -  and the end of it here will be the same don't think that the day is not coming when jews in kansas city will be fleeing for their lives it will not be a place anywhere where jews have known prosperity and security where they will be suddenly upturned as they were in the nazi time
49:06 -  where they held estimable places in law in in in the jurisprudence in the universities as professors in medicine they prevailed in the professions overnight they could no longer practice their professions overnight they could no longer remain in their apartments and homes they were
49:23 -  stripped and put out and cast out and then signed systematically and finally exterminated that the spirit behind that that wants to keep zion from being established through their return waits its next opportunity and unless there's a church that's really a church that is really
49:43 -  a presence that is really knowledgeable and prophetic in its anticipation understanding that really can do battle in a spiritual way that is more than taking cities through through instrumentation through music we're going to see again a reenactment of the tragedy
50:01 -  of the nazi time played out on a yet a larger worldwide scale so contend for the faith that has as its center this mystery this restoration and its great saga of redemption look for and seek an appearing of the lord to be encountered in the way as you're journeying
50:27 -  by which a a a light brighter than the new day sun will come upon you and begin to open things for your consideration as it did for Paul here this scholar writes once Paul realized God's call and sending to the gentiles in God's plan
50:48 -  about the temporary hardening of Israel about the order of salvation the gentiles first in Israel at the end then he goes on and i circle Israel at the end when Paul realized that Israel is at the end it opens up the whole issue of the end we are a church that has not s catalogical expectation
51:12 -  we talk about the end times but we don't really believe it we talk about the end times but we're not living as we really believe that we are at that end and so the issue of the end is the issue of Israel there's no way to have an appropriate end time mentality and disposition that calls for
51:30 -  sacrifice and i could say without exaggeration in our generation and before the end comes our martyrdom and our suffering that does not first understand that it's Israel at the end that makes the end the end the end times the anticipation the s catalogical expectation
51:48 -  that brings to the church a certain vibrancy and and uh serious uh the whole of the church's appreciation that there is an end has to do with the recognition
52:03 -  of the purpose of God for Israel at the end or else one day becomes like another or else one sunday becomes like another or else we gravitate from one program to another program we need to know that we ourselves are journeying as a church toward a consummation and a conclusion
52:23 -  whose restoration Israel is if we don't know that consciously willingly and be willing to the stock for the sacrifice that brings that consummation we will be only a church of programs and predictable things however good and i'm not just talking about mainline denominations i'm talking
52:46 -  about the church at its best even of the charismatic kind the omission and the exclusion of an understanding of the end toward which we are consciously moving that requires from us sacrifice and suffering uh will invariably bring us to another kind of condition which the enemy delights
53:07 -  to see and which you can say again Jesus i know and Paul i know but the church at tansas who let it fear you and recognize that something has come into your consciousness and into your willfulness that is not some reluctant thing that you're embracing like castor oil because you've
53:26 -  got to because God says that there's a place for Israel in the last days but with a rejoicing with a joy as a sense of privilege do you take up this call and know that it's of such a magnitude that there's no way that it could be fulfilled individually however virtuoso that individual is
53:44 -  but requires the participation of all the church as the church and what's what's the price of Paul's revelation that he has received and that changes everything for him it makes him an off scouring to the world it makes him a man so detestable that
54:05 -  men who had formerly celebrated him as the outstanding jew and prime student of the rabbi and is a man to be honored who had a career nicely on the way becomes so detestable that they vow and throw dirt on their heads that the man is not fit to live and if Paul is the prototype
54:26 -  what will be the consequence for us when this vision comes and we take this calling seriously those who have celebrated us and and with admiration noted that we're on the way up and that our church is increasing and enlarged in numbers and we're making a little impact in
54:42 -  the neighborhood will just as soon turn against us as his jewish colleagues turned against them him and we will become as detestable in their sight there's something about embracing the apostolic vision of the mystery of Israel and giving yourself to it consciously and willfully
55:00 -  that will so alter things that you can count on a rejection from the very places now where you are receiving the compliments and the approbation of men are you willing are you willing Paul's heart was stricken he begins his great statement in roman's nine i would wish myself
55:21 -  accursed for my kinsmen according to the flesh God knows he said i'm in continual grief and agony of heart for their condition and i want to say don't think that you're off the hook because Paul prevails like that for his kinsmen according to the flesh because it's not his
55:40 -  identity as a jew that brings him into that kind of urgent identification with his people it's his identification as an apostle it's his proximity to the heart of God and the recognition that before Israel's restoration comes there comes first a time of suffering a time again
56:02 -  of being cast out again into the nations a time of jacob's trouble there's no shortcut when you read isaiah chapter six go and speak to this people that their hearts will be hardened they cannot understand and believe and be saved the prophet cries out how long lord how long will
56:20 -  Israel suffer this condition through my obedient preaching that my message will harden Israel rather than deliver it and God says until until their cities are left waste and desolate until there's a burning until their their bland is uninhabited until there's vast devastation and
56:41 -  destruction and expulsion Paul knew what what was ahead for Israel prior to its restoration prior to the returning of a remnant to the land the redeemed of Israel who returned with sighing and moaning who will have who will have an everlasting joy on their heads after they have
57:02 -  suffered the final tribulations of the last days he grieved for this people and he would wish himself accursed that they might know christ and so that so even though he knew that the ultimate destiny for the nation per se as nation had first to experience a devastation of until
57:25 -  he still did not hesitate to save as many as will be saved it's remarkable that though you know there's an ultimate climax for the nation you don't lean on your haunches for the jew who is presently before you because you know that there's an eschatological destiny for the nation as the
57:44 -  nation you have all the more reason to save those jews who are at hand now that they need not pass through that tribulation which they may not survive so the remarkable thing is the end time perception perception of Paul makes him the avid evangelist now and it ought to be the same
58:03 -  for us you'll know that you have received the revelation of the mystery not only because you anticipate last day's things of a climactic kind but because you are presently engaged and conscious and prayerful to seek for the salvation of every jew that God puts before you
58:22 -  you're praying for the the teachers of your children and your lawyer and your dentist and the neighbor next door and you and you're going out of your way to attend their shabbat services at the local synagogue you're going to the health club at the jewish community center
58:36 -  though you could probably go somewhere else less expensively so that in the locker room or in the steam room you'll have an occasion to speak to a jew in his Godkiss his dvds you've got them trapped and that's what happened to me i'm going to pay over a thousand dollars for one year's membership
59:00 -  in the jewish community center of manhattan that i might attend their fitness club and their swimming pool it's way out of all proportion to sensible economy i can go to some ymha or some someplace local at a much lesser expense but when i went on a guest pass
59:18 -  and i'm taking off my clothing and one man who's getting undressed near me who proves to be a lawyer he says are you an entertainer i said what made you think that he says you look like a man who speaks before the public as a matter of fact occasionally i do and what i speak about
59:37 -  is the faith of God in messiah Jesus oh he said you are you a jewish christian yeah i watched the 700 club myself he said and i enjoy it and we went on having a conversation but another jewish man and they're all professionals because of the expense of going to the exclusive club says yeah
59:57 -  but they're only interested in Israel because they want to bring their messiah they're not really interested in us for our own sake and this guy's arguing with them and so i leave them to argue and i go to the swimming pool and i come back later i go into the steam room and the second
01:00:12 -  man who is arguing meets me there and he continues the conversation but this time there are three other jews trapped in the steam room and so i said hey this is a place for evangelism to catch them with their pants down
01:00:36 -  so i'm commending to you to make yourself accessible to seek to save as many as are lost now that they need not face the peril of this time that is soon coming when they will be in despair for their very lives and so the apprehension of the last days fits us for our present activity
01:01:01 -  toward them as it did Paul just a few more thoughts appreciating your patience and this kind of a groundbreaking effort to break in and to sound some of these things and to allow them to begin and have a life of their own and set in motion those things that would be consequential
01:01:21 -  isn't remarkable that an hour has come when preaching and speaking is no longer preaching and speaking that's no no more an issue of some personal competence or an issue of anointing or some man's ability in scripture but it's now becoming increasingly nuts and bolts
01:01:38 -  of things of the greatest pertinence of practicalities that's an indication of how short the time is and how we need to tremble when privileges like this come and why we need to share with Paul the kind of anguish of soul that he himself felt for his
01:01:56 -  kinsman according to the flesh not because he was jewish but because he was apostolic so that removes from us any excuse for our indifference toward them or only our mild interest because we can't say well that was Paul as a jew for the jews i'm i'm not jewish
01:02:12 -  so i don't prevail for them i don't anguish i'm not as concerned for their souls as he for his kinsman but dear saints he was not anguishing because he was jewish he was anguishing because he was apostolic and you will anguish to the same degree that you are also for you'll take
01:02:29 -  upon yourself in your apostolic identity and communion with God and affinity of his own heart his burdens and his people will be your people it's not an issue of your birth or the natural circumstances of your life it's the issue of the truth of your spiritual identity
01:02:49 -  and i don't think that we're going to be to them what we ought unless it's first proceeding but preceded by an anguish of soul that's how Paul begins in chapter 9 God knows i tell the truth i lie not i am continually beset with an anguish of soul for for for my people for my kinsmen
01:03:10 -  and then follows the remarkable articulation of the apprehension he had of the so great mystery it is preceded first by an identification of such a kind that is painful because there's got to be a willingness to bear that to experience that and not to quickly dismiss ourselves as not being
01:03:30 -  candidates because we're not jews like Paul it's not the issue again i say of jewishness it's the issue of apostolicity of union with God of proximity to his heart and his own anguish as he looks upon this people and knows the end from the beginning and what is yet to come
01:03:50 -  so our own present activity to the jew must stem from the same anguish to save some from the apocalyptic devastation at hand this was the first pentecostal message it will be again the last when Paul when peter under the anointing of the newly received baptism of the holy spirit spoke to
01:04:11 -  spoke to jews that this this is that he showed them the the testimony of the prophet joe that blood on the moon and apocalyptic devastation is the together with the infilling of the holy spirit is the beginning of the end of the age of judgment and so when they said men and brethren
01:04:32 -  what must we do to be saved they were not using saved as we use it they were not wanting to be saved that they have a security in heaven they wanted to be saved from the coming judgment which the fulfillment of joe's prophecy predicted so Paul so peter could say to them
01:04:51 -  believe in the lord Jesus christ and be baptized come out from this untoward and perverse generation why because on that generation God's judgment is going to fall this message is as appropriate today as it wasn't very pentagon but how many of our feet they're speaking to jews that there's
01:05:07 -  a judgment coming and is going to fall on a christ rejecting christ resisting nation and your call to salvation now come out from among them and be baptized and receive the gift of the holy spirit that he's promised to all in any generation who will at last come who's sufficient for these
01:05:26 -  things but the spirit of God and we who ostensibly celebrate that spirit as charismatic and are not moving in the enablement for these large and great ends for which it's given are doing despite to the grace of God and will be doubly dead because we were given a great gift of life
01:05:50 -  and did not employ it for the purposes for which it was intended but for the betterment of our congregation of denominations that's charismatic there's something larger so we cannot overemphasize the significance of Paul's call as apostle to the gentiles as the most lavish investment of God
01:06:12 -  of a superb pharisee as the very statement of the mystery itself that the gentile church is the salvific key to Israel's redemption that when the fullness of the gentiles become in when we discover and affirm the mystery of our own calling when we come into that fullness of
01:06:32 -  God's intention which will not be easy to obtain and that the whole apostolic character of the church waits upon this very thing and that its exclusion at the loss of it is the primary source of all of our present and lamentable condition and makes ourselves the false center we make
01:06:52 -  ourselves a false center as if our enjoyment our services our success our numbers our programs are the purpose of our being the essential purpose of our being is to move them to jealousy who are inveterate enemies of the gospel for our sake and when we substitute any other index as the measure
01:07:14 -  of our success in God as the church we will invariably collapse and become something other than God's apostolic intention we're not to measure by numbers or programs success a budget a finest or anything else but what is our effectiveness presently in the locality where
01:07:31 -  we are of moving jews to jealousy what are we demonstrating to people who despise us and look upon us as rednecks who lack the rudiments of education and have not their refinement or their moral disposition and who are slack in everything overweight and undisciplined in body
01:07:51 -  and life that we should move them to jealousy and yet this is God's mandate and call and if the jews will be benefited so also will the greeks the whole apostolic character of the church waits upon our realization our our taking to
01:08:09 -  heart this great mandate and commission the realization of this mystery as the first and primary reason for our being and that the fact that we're in kansas city or leeward or wherever we are here on that oh oh latha does not um does not get us off the hook i mean just because you're
01:08:32 -  not in new york you're not absolved from the responsibility you can in fact be praying out of your gut for those guys that are in new york and are on the firing line of those of those concentrated communities but there are enough near you i understand that there's not a community
01:08:48 -  anywhere where jews are not and where did my own ministry begin 30 some odd years ago kansas city benedict real ministries was established in kansas city my first ministry seven years old in the lord is as a missionary to the jews sent to kansas city and missouri and nebraska and the
01:09:07 -  whole centerpiece here of the midwest and i'll tell you there are jews to be found everywhere if you'll be praying and seeking and come to them with some sense of things to communicate of which they know nothing and they'll not hear from their rabbis if they don't hear it from you
01:09:24 -  but you need first to anguish in your souls for them we ourselves are a false center and the center needs to be restored because the issue of Israel is the issue of God is the issue of his kingdom is the issue of his glory how does Paul end this great book romans 11
01:09:43 -  these chapters for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever my apologies to all those seated here some familiar faces who have heard this from me again and again and again but i never tire of invoking the remarkable conclusion to Paul's great statement
01:10:04 -  this pain of praise this where Paul freaks out where language can no longer contain his his celebration of the mystery that he has seen that is that is so ponderous and so weighty that has to do with more than even Israel's restoration but the church itself coming of
01:10:22 -  age and coming to fullness and coming to that fittedness for its own eternal ministry in the heavenlies and in the rule of the kingdom from heavenly places some ruling over five cities and some over 10 it doesn't end without death there's a continuation in in glorified bodies ascending
01:10:40 -  and descending upon the son of man in concert with the redeemed Israel for the redemption of all the earth really consciously to know that and be fitted for it and the mystery of Israel is that very provision so that the issue is greater than Israel the issue is greater than the church
01:11:01 -  the issue as it always was from the beginning is the issue of the glory of God forever it takes place in our generation in our time but the consequence of what takes place reverberates eternally for when this event is over history is over the purpose of the church
01:11:23 -  and God has been fulfilled we have been forfeited for our eternal destiny but what has been obtained redounds to the glory of God forever and those christians that are born and are indifferent and look upon one son as another have not the consciousness of this eternal glory that will
01:11:44 -  come through their own obedience to the mandate and call of God to the people of Israel for could suffer all things because he was jealous insanely for the glory of God as an apostle and until that becomes the center of our consciousness and our conduct we ourselves will fall short of the glory
01:12:03 -  and become something less than God's intention however much we might enjoy that lesser thing and so come up and receive and lay hold and be apprehended by the light that God is bringing as we journey on still well let me pray for such a church so i bless them tonight lord
01:12:28 -  for we say with one breath who is sufficient for these things grant my God a fresh pentacost a fresh pouring out of your holy spirit not that we should celebrate our callows charismatic nonsense but to celebrate the enablement by which we can come in to our own destiny and call
01:12:49 -  and honor and glorify you forever bless this inadequate and initial speaking but let it be a breaking in turn up the harder as what give new occasion new dimension for consideration to those who've not had it till this time let every every believer search his own soul with
01:13:08 -  his attitude toward this people Israel whom the world is increasing increasingly finding hated and despicable that the only grounds for a love for them will not be their performance or their condition or their virtue but the very love of God that is unconditional and not earned may we
01:13:27 -  know that for them and for each other so lord bless us we pray give us a blessing good give us a day of new beginnings give us grace bless your ministers enlarge their understanding their perspectives break us out of our conventional molds of how we have defined success and you know
01:13:47 -  my God our trembling insecurities and how we need to succeed and all those kinds of things that impede the larger apostolic vision may we be willing for seeming failure in the embracing of those things that pertain to your glory forever come my God enlarge us fulfill your great purpose
01:14:08 -  and will we thank and give you praise we're full of gratitude that we have so great a high calling in christ Jesus and the enablement that has come through your suffering and death and the spirit poured out from on high to fulfill it
01:14:24 -  let's thank you for tonight what a historic moment we believe let it have its work receive our gratitude in Jesus name we pray amen
