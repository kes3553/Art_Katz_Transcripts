The Rule of God through Israel

00:00 -  We read a word from the book of Jeremiah, chapter 29, verse 11-14. For I know well what thoughts I have about you, says the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of sorrow, that I may give you the end that you await.
00:41 -  And you will call me and go and ask me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me. For if you seek me wholeheartedly, I will let you find me, says the Lord.
00:59 -  And I will turn your captivity and collect you from all peoples and from all places where I have pushed you, says the Lord. And I will bring you back to this place from which I have let you go. We know what this is about.
01:21 -  This is the people of God, the chosen people, Israel, that is now coming back, that the Lord is gathering again in his land. And we are allowed to see how old That is wonderful.
01:43 -  On Tuesday we had a God's service in Talwil. Brother Art made it so clear to us what our, that is, the responsibility of the holy Christian towards Israel is, what we should actually share with Israel.
02:05 -  We are indebted to him because because of his disobedience we are trapped in the oil plant. And now I thought about what we could do to win the Jews for Jesus. We also have Jews here in Switzerland, not a few.
02:28 -  And they are pretty closed off for themselves. And they don't want to be harassed, of course with the Gospel. But that is no harassment, that is a pretext.
02:40 -  If you would also believe, then you should also have a clear goal in mind. You know exactly what healing is. And then a sister came to me.
02:54 -  Brother Klaus PÃ¼blichwiesen gave me her address in Germany. I visited her last year with my wife. And we had a very interesting meeting.
03:06 -  This woman came to the thought of how to bring the Jews the Gospel. And she had a man who was working in the church. He had a function in the church.
03:27 -  And because of his positive belief, he lost this job one day. He became unemployed. And that was going on for a long time.
03:38 -  And she heard that in Basel, at the Fehtal, the Free Evangelical Theological Academy, a Hebrew course would be held.
03:52 -  And so she decided, because the man could make the household and see the children, that she would go to Basel and learn Hebrew. And she was successful in the course.
04:09 -  I don't remember if it was three months or six months. Anyway, a longer time. She lived with other believers.
04:17 -  And then she returned home. And what did she do? She started writing letters to Jews in Israel.
04:27 -  She let a telephone book come from Israel, from Jerusalem and various areas. And she looked for the address. She was a finder.
04:37 -  You say that love is a finder, right? And so she wrote to different people. And she sent them literature in Hebrew.
04:49 -  And she explained what she intended with her Hebrew knowledge. And look, the man was with her. She received positive answers.
05:02 -  And asked how she behaved with this and that Bible and this prophecy. And she could give them information in Hebrew. And a whole series of Jews came to believe.
05:17 -  In Israel. Then I thought, yes, actually you could do that here too, right? Maybe we are also so findy.
05:27 -  Maybe we Jews also love that we... They speak German here. You don't need to learn Hebrew.
05:36 -  Then we can also send them such literature. Which then speaks to your heart. It is important that you do it on a private basis.
05:46 -  Not organized. With a title like we have here. The international mission community.
05:55 -  That would be a red cloth. Not only that. Then you have to be careful.
06:01 -  With the Jews you have to make contact personally. Maybe one or the other has good thoughts. The Lord hears prayers when we are in need.
06:11 -  He can actually show us something. What connects the contact to the Jews. And who knows, maybe we have here in Zurich.
06:20 -  Or elsewhere. A messianic community. Of believers Jews.
06:25 -  That would be wonderful, right? So, not true, the kingdom of God is built on earth. Here is the kingdom of God on earth.
06:35 -  And that prepares us for the heavenly kingdom. The heavenly kingdom. That is not here on earth.
06:43 -  But the kingdom of God is within us. And if we have the Lord within us. Then he will lead us and guide us.
06:50 -  We hear his voice. We are his sheep. He is the good shepherd.
06:56 -  And he guides us, for his sake. Also to the Jews. His chosen ones.
07:02 -  His beloved children. Whom he still holds in his arms. He already wanted to gather them in Jerusalem.
07:09 -  When he was on earth. And they did not hear him. They did not want him.
07:15 -  And now it is more and more open. Also in Israel. The communities there grow.
07:21 -  They accept. And when brother Art comes to Israel. Then he finds open doors.
07:29 -  They used to do that. But today they like to hear the word of God. And we should not forget.
07:37 -  Also what is happening in the world now. Prepares the Jews. Also internally.
07:43 -  As Christians we have a responsibility. And we are their debtors. We want to pay off this debt.
07:49 -  We have not only done a Holocaust. We have also done other things. And there have always been such Christians.
07:58 -  They have protected the Jews. And accepted them. And saved them from the persecution.
08:04 -  And we should do that in the future too. And we want to start right away. And learn that.
08:13 -  This is a remark that I would like to make. I did not say the name of this sister on purpose. So that it does not give a pilgrim father.
08:27 -  You can do that here too. The Lord shows us that already. I would like to ask.
08:36 -  Heavenly Father, we thank you. That you have not rejected your people. You love them.
08:44 -  And you lead them. Also through the night. Also in great danger you are with them.
08:50 -  As you are with us. And you want to lead them back. They came along.
08:58 -  But they also have to come to you. In the country itself. And you are there.
09:03 -  And you are here. You are everywhere. We thank you.
09:06 -  We thank you that we can also proclaim your salvation to them. You open the way, Lord. We ask you.
09:13 -  Show us your ways. And we thank you. That you are with us even today.
09:19 -  You will save your nephew. And equip him with the word. That is important for us.
09:28 -  That we continue to do your will. And perform your task. To your beloved people.
09:37 -  Amen. I would like to give a few messages. Before Brother Art speaks to us.
09:51 -  There on the table. We have put up two lists. For people who would like to have a cassette.
10:00 -  We have made great efforts to force this device to work here. I thought it would be a device that could be operated here. But it is complicated.
10:14 -  This is my old box. That I left at home. And I hope the cassettes will be good.
10:22 -  They will be sent to you. If you sign up. There on the list.
10:27 -  Sometimes it is good. When you hear these lectures again. And can think over exactly.
10:35 -  And then you get much more enriched. So don't forget to sign up. If you want to.
10:45 -  Then it also has some free literature there. We still have some English friends. This is the sheet with the testimonies of the rabbis.
10:57 -  Who became believers. But unfortunately only in English. I don't have any Germans anymore.
11:02 -  They will be sent again. When they are pressed. Then I can tell you.
11:11 -  That every Monday. Every month. We have an Israeli prayer hour.
11:18 -  The main thing is to pray about Israel. That is on Kramerstrasse 7. Not far from here.
11:27 -  And at 8 o'clock in the evening. That is the next Monday. We have such a meeting.
11:34 -  We are cordially invited. Who has any burden for Israel. And wants to pray about it.
11:40 -  He is welcome with us. I would also like to say. When we have another meeting tomorrow.
11:50 -  With Artur Katz. That is not our name. It is a community in Aarau.
11:55 -  Unfortunately I can't tell you the address. But I have a phone number. If you are interested.
12:02 -  He can have a phone number from me. And inform you there. Then he will serve again at 8 o'clock.
12:09 -  And we are happy. That his service is asked more and more. In Switzerland.
12:17 -  He also has other circles. Where he serves. And then he continues to Germany.
12:23 -  And to Finland. He has already been in England. Or in France.
12:28 -  So he is an international evangelist. For Israel. And so we want to ask the gentleman.
12:37 -  Please again and again. That he needs you. And bless you.
12:40 -  In his mighty service. The collection is also for him. He has many expenses.
12:49 -  Of course with his travels. There we have also put up a bag. On the table behind.
12:55 -  Who wants to give something. He will be blessed. And now I would like to give the word.
13:02 -  To our brother. Please. Brother.
13:07 -  You are welcome. To minister to us. The meeting is for you.
13:25 -  Hello saints. Good to see you again. It is good to see you again.
13:32 -  Some of you for the first time. Some for the first time. Well, we need the grace of God.
13:45 -  To convey the subject of God. That's what Paul continually groaned. Grace for utterance to speak.
14:01 -  What shall we groan? Yes, how much we have to drink. To have the grace to fulfill what God has indicated.
14:16 -  So if the Lord is with us today. This should be an expensive afternoon. In the sense of what will be required of us.
14:25 -  In hearing such things. May God take from us. Our harmless curiosity about Israel.
14:46 -  The novelty of our curiosity. Our sentimental sense. That we bring so many feelings when we think of Israel.
15:03 -  But that will not bring us to the goal. Only an apostolic mindset. Can really deal with this mystery.
15:26 -  It is a fulfillment that the Lord could have brought by himself sovereignly. But he is pleased to employ an essentially gentile church. But he is pleased to employ an essentially gentile church.
15:56 -  Why? So that my Jewish people will require an eternity to thank you. For giving yourself so sacrificially for their redemption.
16:14 -  For giving yourself so sacrificially for their redemption. From whom they could never have expected it. Seeing that there has been such an historic enmity between gentiles and Jews.
16:35 -  Can you see the genius of God in this? Can you see the genius of God in all of this? Oh, what depth of wealth and wisdom and the knowledge of God.
16:51 -  So this is a vast statement, the genius of God, the mystery of God in what he has desired. Of such a kind that even our sentiment might interfere with the apprehension of it. So I want to add my own prayer for this speaking this afternoon.
17:32 -  That it would be something more than an informative word. A word that is not just a word. A word that is not just a word.
17:50 -  A word that will perform a work in them that believe. And that it will be a contribution, a step toward the fulfillment itself. All the more because we are so unassuming and unimpressive.
18:21 -  Speaker and audience alike. The more vibrant Christians are out riding their bicycles and sailing their boats. But you older ones are here.
18:44 -  And God will be all the more glorified through you. Because he delights in employing that which is weak and foolish. This is my sole qualification to be his servant.
19:08 -  Hallelujah. So Lord we're pleased that you have such a preference.
19:18 -  What kind of a God are you? That chooses the thing that is weak and foolish. To confound that which is wise and strong in itself.
19:37 -  Little wonder that your Jewish people cannot recognize you. For they very much esteem strength and wisdom. But thank you for the mercy that empties them.
19:55 -  And will bring them to the necessary weakness that will desire your strength. Even for their redemption.
20:11 -  And your eternal purposes through them. Employ this speaking. I don't know how to begin it or how to end it.
20:27 -  So we call upon you as the great Alpha and Omega. Whose honor is so involved in this mystery. So come now and establish it yourself.
20:48 -  We thank you and give you the praise in Jesus' holy name. And God's people said. Amen. So
21:05 -  I know that the burden of the Lord for today is the issue of his divine government. The burden of the Lord for today is the issue of his divine government. And the word government is not even attractive for me.
21:30 -  It sounds so bureaucratic. The shuffling of papers and such a weariness to the forefathers.
21:41 -  And so it must be at the earthly level. But from the heavenly it's quite another thing. His government is righteousness.
21:59 -  And the word government is righteousness. And the word government is righteousness. And peace.
22:15 -  Not just the mere elimination of strife and discord. But the whole manner of a heavenly living. That is invested with the shalom of God.
22:37 -  Do you desire that? Do you expect it in a substantial way? Or are you democratic, all too democratic?
22:55 -  I was amused at the excitement even on the part of Christians for the coming down of the wall from East Germany. Or the collapse of the communist systems in the Eastern nations. And we shared with Czechoslovakia and other of these nations the excitement in taking democratic steps.
23:37 -  As if this were the end of all things. The best of all that could be desired. But it's only been a short time.
23:52 -  And already the disillusionment is setting in. We need something much more. The rule of God himself.
24:12 -  In the earth and among nations. That they might beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. And study war no more.
24:29 -  Probably one of the greatest tragedies of the Christian faith is the harmless way in which we speak of the kingdom of God. It is always rather ambiguous. It has a kind of an airy sense, but never points to anything quite specific.
24:59 -  But the scriptures are very explicit about this kingdom. The theocratic rule of God. Not the democratic rule of men.
25:15 -  And we should daily be breathing, thy kingdom come, thy kingdom come, thy kingdom come. And we should be breathing, thy kingdom come, thy kingdom come. So what has this to do with Israel?
25:40 -  And Israel's restoration. Everything. For the issue of Israel's return is the issue of the coming of the king.
25:54 -  For the issue of Israel's return is the issue of the coming of the king. The issue of the Lord in coming as king. And the establishing of his kingdom.
26:17 -  On their holy hill. On the throne of David. Forever.
26:28 -  Do you believe that? Literally. A very real system of government.
26:46 -  On a particular throne. Of David. That fulfills the covenant promises of God to that people.
27:05 -  And answers the legitimate question of the disciples of Jesus. Is it time now to establish the kingdom of Israel? And answers the legitimate question of the disciples of Jesus.
27:16 -  Is it time now to establish the kingdom of Israel? For the kingdom of Israel is the kingdom of God. But it is also the kingdom for all nations.
27:36 -  And the center and capital will be Jerusalem. For out of Zion shall go forth the law and out of Jerusalem the word of the Lord. To all nations.
27:54 -  Are you with me so far? How do the nations feel about that? How delighted are they in the anticipation of God's theocratic rule?
28:11 -  Frankly, they are not too excited. Because they enrich themselves in unrighteousness. And have profited by their rule.
28:29 -  In self-seeking ways. In self-seeking ways. And love their privilege.
28:45 -  And want it to continue. And I'm speaking now not only about earthly rulers. But the true rulers of this world.
29:05 -  The Gods of this age. The principalities and the powers of the air. The invisible realm of demonic rulership.
29:21 -  As expressed through a fallen angiology. A fallen network of angels. In rebellion against God.
29:41 -  But still holding governmental office in the heavenlies. And turning it to their own advantage. That men should worship them as the Gods of this world.
30:02 -  And to turn away the attention of men from him who is God. Am I speaking mysteries? Have I lost you?
30:18 -  Do you know of the presence of these powers of the air? We even say, there's something in the air. Just crossing from one national border into another.
30:38 -  The whole atmosphere has changed. There's something in the air. And that something is the invisible realm of demonic spirit.
31:00 -  That have brooded uninterruptedly over those places. To influence and sway the conduct of those nations. And they want to maintain their rule.
31:24 -  And will resist in every way this kingdom that will come. And have already resisted. Almost to the point of the annihilation of the Jewish people.
31:47 -  What's the connection? Simply this. Jesus said, you will not see me again until you will say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
31:59 -  Jesus said to the Jews, you will not see me again until you will say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And his resistance is in the whole context connected with them doing evil. Acts 321 says that he is actually contained in the heavens.
32:27 -  Pinned up. Waiting for the restoration of all things spoken by the prophets since the world began. And what have these prophets spoken uniformly?
32:50 -  The restoration of Israel in the last days. The return to their land. Through the mercies of God.
33:11 -  The acknowledgement of Jesus as Lord. And the establishing of a kingdom through them in promise to their fathers. That will be established upon the throne of David, literally.
33:35 -  The powers of the air know this better than the church. The powers of the air know this better than the church. How then shall they avert the threat to their vested and unchallenged rule?
34:01 -  By annihilating that people through whom the rule comes. By annihilating that people through whom the rule comes. So I can tell you with complete confidence.
34:19 -  That the Nazi time was only a foreshadowing of something much greater. A final and severe persecution of the Jewish nation throughout all the earth. To the point of annihilation.
34:44 -  And the greater number of them will not survive it. But out of that persecution God will bring a remnant. That the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion.
35:01 -  That the redeemed of the Lord shall return to Zion. And mourning and sighing shall flee away. And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads.
35:20 -  This is God's last day scenario. And the anti-Semitic hatred is accelerating in every nation even as I speak. And so where will be the church at this time?
35:45 -  And where will the community of Jesus be at this time? Where Israel in these last days will be taken with them. God's great care that this remnant comes out.
36:09 -  By the extension of your mercy that they might obtain mercy. When the issue of mercy for them may be the issue of life or death. And when the extending of mercy might be at the risk of your own life.
36:39 -  You should tie me up and carry me out of this room. Are these things to speak to an intelligent and polite audience? Such a fearful and apocalyptic scenario?
37:08 -  When everything seems so peaceful today. And this is the best of all possible worlds. And really, Brother Art, we don't really need God's theocratic kingdom.
37:31 -  If it has got to come at such a price as this. Can't we just improve what we have? Progressively?
37:52 -  This is our secret heart. We want amelioration, not glory. And so the Lord remains pent up in the heavens waiting.
38:20 -  For the church is the key to Israel's redemption. And Israel's redemption is the key to the kingdom. And the kingdom is the key to health for the nations.
38:40 -  Millennial sanity. The peace that is not the result of political compromise. When we say peace, peace, but there is no peace.
39:01 -  But the peace that is with righteousness. And so in the book of Haggai. The last prophet before Zachariah.
39:22 -  Chapter 2. Verse 6. Verse 6.
39:29 -  Thus says the Lord of hosts, once more in a little while I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land. And I will shake all the nations, and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord. That he established the bounds of the nations.
40:06 -  According to the number of the sons of Israel. That somehow the whole issue of world government. The rule of God over the nations.
40:21 -  That God will rule over all nations. Is all together proportionate to the sons of Israel. And that's why Jerusalem is not only to be their capital.
40:40 -  But the capital of God in the world. For he has established the nations. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
40:57 -  To glorify him. When they come under his lordship and authority. In the rule that goes forth out of Zion.
41:10 -  And what shall happen to the nations that refuse that design. They suffer curse. If they will not come up to Jerusalem.
41:35 -  And celebrate the feast of tabernacles. By an actual physical act of submission. In the acknowledgement of the rule of God from Israel.
41:55 -  God will deprive them of rain. And in the absence of rain is the plagues. That's what it says in Zechariah chapter 14.
42:17 -  Verse 16. And 17. Verse 19.
42:46 -  This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all nations. Who do not go up to celebrate the feast of booths. Can you understand why the heathen rage.
43:03 -  The kings and the rulers seeking a vain thing. They want to break off the connection with God and with his anointed. But he holds them in derision.
43:16 -  He laughs them to scorn. He will set his king on his holy hill Zion. And give him the nations for his inheritance.
43:31 -  This needs to come into action. Into our consciousness. Into our understanding.
43:41 -  Into our millennial expectation. For which Israel's restoration is the key. That when he will again be their king.
43:56 -  And his prince David will rule over them. And establish his sanctuary and his drilling place in their Zion.
44:10 -  Then also will he be king over all the earth. We won't see nations starving to death. While the Swiss have their coffee in their cafes and their torte
44:26 -  and the other customary luxuries. Completely indifferent to the suffering that is elsewhere in the world. And helpless to affect it.
44:49 -  For of the righteousness and of his peace there shall be no end. And the trees will clap their hands. The hills will skip as rams.
45:05 -  Nature itself will respond to the beneficent rule of God. The mental asylums will be emptied. And abortion will be unknown.
45:22 -  Righteousness. A new heaven and a new earth will indwelleth righteousness. Thy kingdom come.
45:35 -  And how it will be opposed by the powers of hell. Who hate Israel unto death. Because they know that this is the people through whose restoration he comes.
45:54 -  And what will you do in that day? You know what the German church did. It collapsed.
46:10 -  It could not identify with this hated people. It was not able to identify with this hated people. For fear that it would suffer their fate.
46:31 -  This will really be the test for us. Of whether or not he is Lord. Lord of our substance, our security, our homes.
46:51 -  We had best begin now. To bring everything under his rule. For the way in which we shall respond to this people in that last day.
47:09 -  Determines our eternal destiny. When did we see you hungry, thirsty, naked? When did we see you hungry, thirsty, naked?
47:27 -  And where you did not do this to the least of these, my brethren. You did it not unto me. Away with you to the place that is prepared for the devil and his angels.
47:47 -  That to extend mercy to them is to do it for him. And when they come as refugees and driven people through our communities. Whatever the consequence to ourselves.
48:11 -  Whatever the risk involved. We cannot help but extend mercy. We must give water to the thirsty.
48:23 -  And clothing to the naked. And food for the hungry. And so will they see the Lord in that grace.
48:35 -  And be moved to jealousy. And believe in him. Whom their fathers opposed.
48:48 -  And so the redeemed of the Lord shall return. Unto Zion. And sighing and mourning shall flee away.
49:00 -  And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. Because of you. This is a little bit more than planting a tree in Israel.
49:26 -  And we will not have the incentive to do it. Except that we recognize it is for his glory. And we will not have the incentive to do it.
49:36 -  If we do not know it is for his glory. That the king come and take his throne. On the throne of David.
49:52 -  In this city. And that holy hill. That the Lord shall go forth out of Zion.
50:00 -  And the word of the Lord. And the word of the Lord. To all nations.
50:10 -  This is God's program for peace. So aren't you pleased that you are alive for this hour? So are you pleased that you are alive for this hour?
50:29 -  And for this purpose have you come? The privilege of participation. In the concluding drama of this age.
50:47 -  Israel's return. His coming. His kingdom.
50:54 -  His rule. To the nations. Millennial blessing.
51:04 -  Through the obedience of the church. Even if it should require their life. Then only is he Lord.
51:17 -  Only then will he really be Lord. Perhaps we want to sing this now with much greater dedication. With truth.
51:34 -  With sincerity. Uncompromisingly. Even repentantly.
51:44 -  Lord, I am one of those. I move myself at my will. To obtain a better job and a more lucrative response.
52:02 -  I did not think to consult you. I certainly would not have thought to consult my elders. I am my own man.
52:17 -  And of the increase of his government and of his peace, there shall be no end. Now and forever. Let it become eternal.
52:41 -  His kingdom come. His rule. Your government.
52:48 -  Your government. Upon his shoulder. In truth.
52:54 -  Hallelujah. Let's pray. You pray. You should pray.
53:09 -  Transact with the king. Yes, negotiate something with the king. Establish something.
53:17 -  Point out something. In truth. That you might know his peace.
53:26 -  Deep in your soul. The end of fear and intimidation and threat. Where there is no more fear, no more intimidation, no more threats, no more intimidation.
53:38 -  For he has become Lord. Overall. Right from where you sit.
53:51 -  Just a few words out of your mouth. Will establish it. Imagine what this will mean for the churches.
54:11 -  Whose elders will now be earnestly sought after and consulted about the decisions of our life. They are not accustomed to this. They don't even desire it.
54:33 -  It puts them under a new responsibility. To be able to seek for and find the mind of the Lord for others. To confirm or to nullify.
54:51 -  This is a real obligation. This is a real obligation. That can only be performed in the spirit.
55:04 -  By men who have done nothing more than open and close windows and move chairs. It requires the church to be church. For only as true church can it fulfill God's purposes toward Israel.
55:31 -  What is less than that can fulfill our purpose. Nice meetings, biblical preaching. But it doesn't fulfill his.
55:43 -  So even Israel in her unbelief. Is a factor toward the church. That compels it to be church.
56:05 -  Even against her own reluctance and unwillingness. Oh the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God. Who has been his counselor.
56:25 -  It's not only in Israel that needs us. It's a church that needs them. To be the incentive to be what we need to be.
56:43 -  Or suffer an eternal embarrassment. Do you want such a church? This would be nothing less than a kind of revolution.
57:02 -  It requires us really to be saints. Really to seek the Lord. And to pray for those who are in places of responsibility and leadership.
57:19 -  And to be authentically joined to such a body. Which is more than the issue of attending. One would almost think that this were the purpose for our salvation.
57:39 -  And that's the way it needs to be seen. We are saved for his sake and not our own. Something is required from which we have shrunk.
58:00 -  And the pathetic condition of the church speaks for itself. Let it first say he is Lord, he is Lord. And then we will see God moving toward his people Israel.
58:29 -  So I want to conclude with a prayer for the church. The church of Zurich. The church of Switzerland.
58:42 -  The nation of the reformers. Who didn't go far enough. And who even now not taken seriously enough.
58:58 -  That the generation of our youth can puncture their veins with their drugged needles in the very shadow of the statue of the reformer. All because the kingdom had not come. And that he is not really Lord.
59:20 -  Even while we sing the chorus. To him every knee will bow. And that he is not really Lord.
59:33 -  Even while we sing the chorus. And every tongue confesses. That Jesus is Lord.
59:45 -  To the glory of God the Father. Lord we just conclude this afternoon with a prayer. Joining our hearts together.
59:57 -  And praying for the church in this land. And in this city. So weak.
01:00:08 -  So lacking in power. In authenticity. So constituting no threat to the powers of darkness that grew overhead.
01:00:27 -  May our love for Israel. Our jealousy for your coming and your kingdom. Prompt us and stir us.
01:00:44 -  And there submit ourselves in truth. To your Lordship through men. Bless the church in Zurich.
01:01:00 -  That it might bless Israel. And hasten the day of your appearing. In Jesus name we pray.
01:01:13 -  Amen. Bless you.
