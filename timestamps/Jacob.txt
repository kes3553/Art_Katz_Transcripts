Jacob

00:00 -  Here he will meet us on the way, And here he will walk in his path, And the world shall walk on his side, The word of the Lord shall be said, And the world shall walk on his side, The word of the Lord shall be said,
00:35 -  And the world shall walk on his side, The word of the Lord shall be said, And here he will meet us on his way, And here he will walk in his path, And the world shall walk on his side, And the word of the Lord shall be said,
01:10 -  And here he will meet us on his way, And here he will walk in his path, And the world shall walk on his side, And the word of the Lord shall be said. Thank you, Father.
02:05 -  Thank you, Lord. Yes, my house is a holy house, but it's not a sad house. There's joy in my presence, there is happiness, there is dance, but there's joy in my house.
02:30 -  And I would have you be joyful in my presence, because I'm the victor. Nothing that you face is too difficult for me. I'm the victor. Thank you.
02:47 -  And my victory is always established. Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
02:58 -  Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
03:07 -  Thank you, Lord. Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine. My lips shall praise Thee, and my lips shall praise Thee.
03:36 -  Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine. My lips shall praise Thee, and my lips shall praise Thee. Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine.
04:33 -  My lips shall praise Thee, and my lips shall praise Thee. My lips shall praise Thee, and my lips shall praise Thee. Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine.
05:06 -  Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine. Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine. Thy loving kindness is better than mine, Thy loving kindness is better than mine.
06:18 -  I'm glad to see so many of you still hanging on and hanging in. That you haven't been terrified out of your socks. Well, are we cozy enough, close enough?
06:33 -  I'll tell you how foolish I am. Can we move this couch just a little closer, right to the edge of the rug? And then correspondingly move all the chairs this way, come as close as you can.
06:56 -  There's a nice chair over here. Is there anybody around my age bracket who needs a special cushioning? I was going to die for it, but I don't qualify.
07:08 -  I said I was going to die for it, but I don't qualify. Is there a Samuel here who has come from out of town? A Jewish brother that we had hoped would make it this morning?
07:24 -  Okay. Well, Lord, a privilege to again stand before your people. And I love, my God, the way in which it pleases you to bring forth through me what you will.
07:40 -  Govern this mouth again so that your own soul will be gratified, Lord. That's our first concern. That you yourself will be delighted, be gratified in your own soul
07:52 -  for what you hear, my God, coming forth because it's ordained. And that your saints would be delighted also. If you're pleased, we're pleased.
08:00 -  And we love your word, my God, and it's important to us. It's critical, crucial. So may we hear from your heart.
08:07 -  We thank and give you praise again for the privileged occasion with your saints and under this roof. A happy assembly of your people in Jesus' name.
08:17 -  Amen. Do you think I can do this sitting? How does that feel?
08:22 -  Anything lost for that? No. Well, somewhere between the shower or wherever,
08:30 -  the thought of Jacob came to my spirit and it seems to be remaining. So I think that the Lord wants us to take a peek at our patriarchal father. Notice that I said our.
08:50 -  Paul in Corinthians, addressing Greeks who have come to the faith of the God of his fathers, says something about as our ancestors also. He includes them in the outer that includes also Hebrews in the same faith.
09:10 -  So you just need to let that come into your consciousness, that you who were once far off and without God, without hope in the world have been brought nigh by the blood of Israel's Messiah
09:24 -  into the covenants and hopes and promises of that nation and into the Commonwealth of the nation itself. Peter speaks to the Gentile believers and says,
09:35 -  Conduct yourself in a way before the Gentiles, as if they themselves are not that anymore. They have taken on a new designation.
09:44 -  They've come into the family of God, the Commonwealth of God's people. It's not you've become Jewish. There's no big deal about that.
09:53 -  You've come into the Hebraic faith and been grafted in actually into that root. Their promises, their hopes are yours and their faith is yours. So your identification with them as being one with yourself
10:09 -  is different from the Church seeing itself as an entity separate from an other than Israel. That does not displace them. We are not the Israel of God at their expense.
10:21 -  We are the Israel of God with them, more properly and more truly spiritually than they presently are but will become because of the jealousy to which they will be moved when they see you exhibiting the kind of fruit that should have been their product,
10:40 -  had they been grafted into their own root and not be broken off. Got the picture? Okay, class dismissed.
10:49 -  Okay, Genesis. There are two episodes critical in the consideration of Jacob becoming Israel. Chapter 28.
11:13 -  I don't think it's probably too great an exaggeration to say that all of us are either the one or the other, Jacob or Israel. It's not an exaggeration to say that the present state of Israel is more probably Jacob than it is Israel.
11:30 -  It's a root to becoming Israel but it's not going to become it any more easily than its patriarchal father before it. Israel is not an automatic designation. It's an ultimate statement of a spiritual designation.
11:47 -  That's not yours by virtue of birth but by acquisition, by relationship with the God of Israel. So it's a very precious term. We mustn't bandy that about as if it is speaking only genealogically to a certain nation.
12:07 -  The Israel of God, the people of God who have come into a very particular relationship with God and take on his own identification. Well, Jacob was not that.
12:21 -  Everybody knows what the name Jacob means, right? Schema, supplanta, wise alec, conniver. He had the right intentions.
12:30 -  He desired the right thing but he didn't know how to obtain it. He schemed to get it and therefore offended his brother Esau and had to flee for his very life for having rubbed his brother the wrong way.
12:46 -  Does that bear any correspondence with today's particular political situation in the Middle East? They had the right intention but they're not going to acquire it by scheming, wheeling or dealing. If they seek that, they're going to chafe and bring their brother to a boil that will threaten their own existence
13:08 -  and that's exactly what we're seeing now. Jacob had to flee then and Jacob will have to flee now. That was something of last night's subject.
13:19 -  So it's a remarkable parallel. I can't say enough for this and this is beyond symbolism. This is a paradigm.
13:28 -  You know that word? Like a pattern of an ultimate and unfailing kind. So not only is this true about present Israel who is really Jacob
13:40 -  but it's unhappily so much the statement of ourselves. As I tried to say last night, our hopes for Israel as a state that they should somehow make it and succeed is very much the projection of our own desire for ourselves.
13:56 -  It has the consideration of success rather than the consideration of glory. That, by the way, is part of the definition of Jacob. Jacob is not concerned with the glory of God.
14:13 -  He may acknowledge God and he may be respectful but he's not yet come to that state where the central thing of his being is the jealousy and the desire for the glory of God. That's what makes a Jacob into an Israel.
14:28 -  That is what defines Israel as Israel. That the foremost purpose for being is the glory of God. Can you see why the church is itself so much more Jacob than it is Israel?
14:41 -  Something has to happen and God sets the thing in motion and brings Jacob to crisis. So he had to flee and in his flight, in verse 10 of chapter 28, Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night because the sun had set.
15:08 -  I can't run over this. The sun had set on Jacob. It's more than just a chronological gesture, watches. It's a statement of a man who is in crisis and decline that issues out of his Jacob life
15:26 -  and his mistaken notion of how to obtain desirable ends. The sun has set on that. Well, praise God, that happened to me 35 years ago.
15:37 -  The sun set on Jacob. I had attained professional status. My Jewish mother could probably be proud of her son.
15:44 -  She couldn't say, my son, the doctor. Neither could she say that my son, the evangelist. But the sun set on that.
15:54 -  It's interesting how the Lord will allow a certain measure of success and the obtainment of what you desire. And then having obtained it, it turns to ashes in your mouth and even sets the thing by which the shade of night falls on it. You don't enjoy it and you don't know what you were pursuing.
16:16 -  So taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven. And the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
16:33 -  And the Lord stood beside him and said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give it to you in your offspring. And your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth.
16:47 -  And you shall spread abroad to the west, to the east, and to the north and to the south. And all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you, will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land.
17:00 -  For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, surely the Lord is in this place and I did not know it. And he was afraid and said, how awesome is this place.
17:15 -  This is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven. And a precious interlude in a mighty dream of great portent. And even Jacob's response is prophetic.
17:37 -  The Lord is in this place and I knew it not. That may be a statement of the Church to a great degree today. He's in the place but we don't know it to the sense that we have an awe and a fear and a reverence for the God who is in this place.
17:55 -  Because this place is the gate of heaven and in fact there is no other gate. Unless men find the route to heaven through the house of God, they'll not find it at all. So all of this deserves uttermost attention.
18:12 -  And it wouldn't be too much to take a week and go over every aspect of this enormous dream God given and the Lord was beside him. What a remarkable thing. Now being the students of scripture that you are, what is significant about the way in which the Lord addressed Jacob from the very beginning?
18:36 -  God being candid and utterly truthful. I'm the God of your father Abraham and of Isaac and the land upon which you lie I will give it to you. What is being said there that is omitted?
18:54 -  You Bible students, you exegetes who draw out the meaning from the scriptures. You're getting a zero for the day. What's being omitted?
19:06 -  What's being omitted? Read that again. The personality of Jacob himself?
19:13 -  No. Reprimand? Reprimand?
19:19 -  Well it constitutes a kind of reprimand. It's a most significant omission. I'm the God of your father Abraham and of Isaac and the land on which you lie.
19:32 -  What did he leave out? He said I'm not your God yet. He's got all the right pedigree.
19:43 -  He's got all the genealogy. He couldn't have a descent more honorable than coming from Abraham and Isaac. But the God of his fathers is not yet his God.
19:56 -  It's not automatic. Something has got to happen to establish that relationship. And I praise God that he doesn't gloss over this or just give a kind of religious,
20:10 -  unctuous statement to pacify Jacob. The omission is enormously significant. And I think that Jacob was so much Jacob that he missed it.
20:19 -  I don't think he was aware of how significant that omission was. But by the time we finish this morning we'll see how Jacob becomes Israel and how the God of his fathers becomes his God in fact.
20:33 -  And what it takes to come to that. But before we see that conclusion we need further to ponder what Jacob does having received this dream. His statements is precious.
20:50 -  Sure the Lord is in this place and I didn't know it. How awesome is this place. Full of form.
20:57 -  This is none other than the house of God. And what is it? There's no building.
21:01 -  It's only a stone upon which he laid his head. But this place where the revelation and the dream comes in God's presence and statement is the house of God. So maybe that's something that we need to reconsider.
21:15 -  The house is not an issue of architecture. It's an issue of presence. It's an issue of revelation.
21:21 -  And so he was right in what he said. Jacob is a prophet and responded very impressively in saying those things that this is the gate of heaven. Why?
21:36 -  Because the ladder is rooted in the earth and ascends to heaven. Oh I'm so happy for that. I wouldn't like a gate that is ethereal and removed from the earth.
21:49 -  I like it where the rungs go right into the earth that it might ascend to heaven. And that God is willing to come down into that terra firma and the reality of it so that men may have a way up. So everything about this is very precious, very revealing.
22:08 -  So Jacob in verse 18 rose early in the morning and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel, which means the house of God, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
22:27 -  Then Jacob made a vow saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God
22:43 -  and this stone which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that you give me I will surely give one tenth to you. Amen.
22:52 -  How do you like that? How do you like a Jacob prayer? Can there be anything more revealing than a Jacob prayer?
23:04 -  And how much is it revealing of us, of the one tenth that I will give you if you give me? This is a transaction. This has Jacob as its center.
23:17 -  It's a commercial contract which maybe is more generous than what many are willing to do, but it reveals Jacob as Jacob. As long as Jacob remains Jacob, and this is his mentality,
23:31 -  and he has himself as the centerpiece in the new relationship with God who has been revealed to him, there will be no glory in that house and no fulfillment of the purposes of God through that house. Clearly, Jacob has got to become Israel.
23:47 -  The people of the Middle East have got to become Israel. The Church of Jesus needs to become Israel because it is so much a reflection of this Jacob mentality,
24:01 -  of so much given for so much received, playing it close to the vest, self-interest, if God will be with me in the way that I will go.
24:17 -  Brother. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever prayed, and more than once,
24:27 -  Lord, if you will do this for me, I will do that for you? Have you ever prayed, if you give me an ability or courage or words, then I will speak them or do them?
24:40 -  That's a common place. That's still the place of Jacob and not yet Israel. Because it still visualizes the relationship of two distinct separate entities,
24:55 -  one apart from the other, and that what we think is the relationship to which we're being called is the nice kind of cooperative partnership
25:04 -  by which we retain our identity separate from God and want only his help. It's not the mean thing. We want to do well, but we want to do it with his help.
25:15 -  Do you like that? What do you mean, do I like it? Is there another way?
25:20 -  Yes, there is. And until you find it, you're still in the Jacob place. The other way is not you asking God for help,
25:31 -  in which you will then give him a dividend, but that you can't anymore distinguish or desire where Jacob ends and where God begins. That the life of Jacob is the life of God,
25:46 -  and the purpose of God is the purpose of Jacob, so much so that Jacob is no longer Jacob and he requires a new name. So this is remarkably revealing of a religious mentality
25:59 -  that I believe pervades the church today. Not just the most common place expressions, but its best expression is still Jacob transacting with God
26:12 -  because the church and its members are unwilling to forsake their own identity and want only to succeed for God on the basis of what he will give them that will enable them to succeed and for which they will give him this return.
26:27 -  Amen. Is that right? Amen.
26:31 -  Are you embarrassed? No. I love this.
26:40 -  If God will be with me, that's still the center of the Jacob life. He was a man who desired spiritual things and the inheritance of God and found a way through deceit to obtain it from his brethren.
26:56 -  But it was still me, still operating, still scheming for me. And Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration, when Jesus is revealed in his glory with Moses and Elijah,
27:13 -  it is good for us to be here. Let us build you free booths. He's still a Jacob.
27:23 -  So long as there's an us, so long as there's a me as the foremost consideration that is respectful toward God, wants benefit from God, and intends to give God some return,
27:35 -  we're still not in the ultimate place of the designation of Israel that glorifies God and is radically different than other than this kind of Jacob thing. Now, since this is not my thought this morning that I should be speaking this,
27:51 -  it came to me in the bathroom and in lieu of no other inspiration I'm speaking of. So it must be that there are some Jacobs in our midst who need to hear this and keep me in this way that I go,
28:13 -  the way that I will choose, the way that gratifies me. It's not going to be grossly sinful. It will be respectful and honorable and ethical and moral,
28:24 -  but it's still the way that I go, the way that I will choose to go. You know what I love about Jacob and about Jews in general? They're very forthright. They don't mince words. They don't pretty it up.
28:38 -  What they are is what they are and what you see is what you get. And I love that. This is absolutely candid. There couldn't have been a better portrait of the statement of the condition of the man
28:48 -  who though he had the most distinguished ancestry, was yet in himself not in any way as in a place with God as were his fathers. And I will surely give one text to you with sport.
29:10 -  Well, Jacob continued on his journey and you know all the rest of what happened, but I want to just focus in now on the turning point where Jacob has his name changed. Something radical happens to the man that he can become the father of a nation of sons, sons of Israel.
29:38 -  And that's in Chapter 32. Jacob is returning to his homeland. These are quiet two wives and handmaidens and flocks and herds and all kinds of possessions and servants. And he learns that Issa is coming to meet him.
30:06 -  What sort of a man sows that who shall he reap? And it's a day of comeuppance and how to avoid this. And so Jacob is still Jacob scheming, breaking up his possessions into bands and sending a servant with every portion.
30:22 -  So if you meet my brother Issa, tell him that his brother Jacob is coming behind. But this is a gift for him that will placate him. Maybe the Oslo agreement and the concessions that are being made to the PLO today are exactly in this spirit and this mentality.
30:41 -  It's not a calling on the God who had already revealed himself some years before at Bethel, but still crying out to God, Lord help me, but at the same time making provision himself out of his own human cunning. That's still Jacob. You're not Israel until you've pulled out all the stops and God is your total and utter dependency.
31:08 -  And if you perish, you perish, but you are not going to condescend to your own wit. You're not going to scheme and wield and deal. You're not going to push him. You're not going to have a safety provision, what do you call it?
31:21 -  An escape hatch, an extra bank account that if God does not come through, you're still not left to pauper. That's still Jacob. God is wanting his utter and total being thrust upon him. And he's created the crisis by which that can come.
31:40 -  But it's interesting to observe how deep the Jacob thing is, even in crisis. There's this inveterate and unconscious continuation of scheming, wheeling, dealing out of oneself to engineer yourself through the situation. He's not yet come to the place.
32:01 -  It raises the question, how far will God go to get Jacob to become Israel? Very far. So verse 22 of Chapter 32, the same night he got up and took his two wives, his two maids and his 11 children across the ford of the River Jabak. He took them and sent them across the screen and likewise everything that he had.
32:28 -  Jacob was left alone. The King James says that much better. He sent over all that he had and Jacob was all alone. Are you getting that? Are you pondering that? He sent over all that he had. There is no reserve. Every last thing is required and he was left alone.
32:57 -  Because we're wanting to ask what are the conditions for which God waits that he will wrestle with a man, a nation or a church to bring that one into such a relationship with him that transforms everything. And the condition is you have to send over all that you have.
33:19 -  So if you can picture me 35 years ago, I traveled for 14 months with a backpack, a small one, and lived out of it for 14 months. Everything was reduced to what I could carry on my back. I had one wash and wear shirt and I don't know, a few pair of socks, whatever it was.
33:40 -  But that's symbolic of the kind of reduction that's required of which God waits. That we don't hedge ourselves around with the kinds of things that will insert themselves between God and ourselves. There's got to be an abandon.
33:56 -  Whatever it is that we're holding onto as reserve has got to be sent ahead. It's got to be parted from us and we have to come to a place where we are all alone. I know that Jacob knew that he was fulfilling the kind of requirement for which God waits, but he did it.
34:19 -  He was left all alone. Sounds like as thorough a stripping as a man can experience. But so precious is what is going to take place now that it's worth it all.
34:35 -  And that God will allow success to give the man herds and cattle and maids and servants and wives and all of that prosperity. Only to bring them to a place where he's required to send it over. It's not unlike the President of Israel that he gives it a 50 year history.
34:58 -  Allows it to become a substantial state in a high tech society. Army, nuclear facility, all that kind of stuff. Only that it's to be passed over.
35:10 -  They're not to employ it. Jacob was not to employ his however he wanted to use it to placate it will not serve. He's got to be parted from it and come to a place of utter desolation and aloneness is the condition for God.
35:27 -  Maybe that's why many of us remain in the Jacob state where our lives are hedged about by dependencies and loyalties and identifications and things in which we have investment. And God is a God who's total. I don't know why that should astonish us.
35:47 -  He's waiting for men totally. Moses had come up to God in that condition. He was a prince in Egypt and a prince of Israel.
35:59 -  He came from the priestly line. He was a Levite. He was erudite, learned, trained.
36:06 -  He's a man of remarkable ability. And God called him up to the mount. Come up unto me and be there.
36:13 -  And I will give you the tablets of the Lord that you may take. Forty days are sent to the mount and seven days at the crest in the mountain wreathed with smoke before on the fortieth day, God could call to him to come up unto me and be there. Don't come up for the tablets.
36:38 -  Don't come up for your ministry and what advantage you're going to obtain by receiving this from me. Come up unto me and be there. Really be there.
36:50 -  And if you have anything that will in any way inter fuse itself and serve as a barrier, whether it's your ideology, your theology, your denominational identification and loyalty, you stay in the smoke for six days. On the seventh day, I'll call you out. This is another message, a precious one.
37:12 -  And I wouldn't be able to speak it except that I had actually been in the smoke, not on the mount, but in a building on fire at Ben Israel. With three o'clock in the morning, we could hear the crackling in the smoke and we had to run out. And that building went up like a whew.
37:27 -  And on the marble top of the kitchen, I had laid my box of masking tapes, all these gorgeous, exquisite messages. And my wife had her pocketbook on the countertop. We had come up from Kansas City where we had lived for some months and we came out of the building and she said, why don't you go in and get my pocketbook?
37:51 -  I said, sure, no sweat. I know that house like the palm of my hand. I went down on my hands and knees, pushed open the front door. The distance from here to that top was about just like it is now.
38:03 -  And I went into the building and was lost, completely lost, completely disoriented. I didn't know where I was. Not only could I not find the counter, I couldn't find the door through which I just entered.
38:18 -  I can't say enough. I praise God for the experience. But I want to tell you that smoke is the most disorienting phenomenon that there is.
38:29 -  And God put Moses in it for six days before he allowed him to come into his presence on the seventh. He smoked him out of any last vestige of Moses' ability, whether Jewish or Egyptian. Even the correct knowledge of God had to be smoked out because now he was going to come into contact and into union with very God himself.
38:54 -  Isn't it remarkable that even the correct knowledge can be a barrier to God? That we can hide behind our correct doctrines, our denominational statements? The smoke.
39:10 -  To remove every six days. That number is the number of man on the seventh day. The number of completion.
39:18 -  He came into the presence of God. Come up unto me, Moses, and be there. Then I will give you.
39:27 -  But until you are there, in all that you are, stripped, and the utter essence of what you are as a man, without distinction and the raw grit of your humanity, facing me in the totality of my divinity, I'll not give you the tablets.
39:44 -  You're not fit to bear them or teach them or to employ them. I'm not just an intermediary along the way to provide you with the enablement for your ministry. I am your ministry.
39:56 -  The tablets of the law are the statement of what I am in myself as God. And how can you be a purveyor and communicate them and don't know the one who is the lawgiver himself? Come up unto me and be there.
40:13 -  Jacob had to be there with the same God. Only the encounter was structured differently but has the same very essence for Moses, for Jacob, for us, and for the Israel that has yet to become Israel, or it will not bless all the families of the earth.
40:36 -  This statement to Jacob that your people will be like a proliferation of sand of east and west and north and south and they will bless all the families of the earth yet waits its fulfillment and it cannot be fulfilled as a Jacob people.
40:51 -  They've got to know God and communicate him as he in fact is and not as one supposes him to be. And if that's the requirement of the Israel that is yet Jacob there, what of ourselves? What has our witness constituted if we ourselves have not come in to the radical communion with God
41:17 -  and we ourselves still separate entities if God will help me in the way that I will go, my ministry, and give me what I need for it, I'll give him back a good return, whether we have never actually audibly articulated that or not.
41:34 -  And that is the unspoken statement of the great majority of God's people and the church itself at large. It's Jacob, it's not yet Israel. That's why Christ is coming since. So he sent them across the stream and likewise everything he had, Jacob was left alone
42:00 -  and the man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he struck him on the hip socket and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
42:14 -  Then he said, let me go for the day is breaking. This is the man, capital N. But Jacob said, I will not let you go unless you bless me. Whatever we can say about Jacob, to denigrate him and his character and his scheming
42:32 -  and wheeling and dealing and all these kinds of things, the one virtue that maybe is a key to ultimate salvation and redemption is I will not let you go. Now that you're this near and I sense who and what you are, I'll not let you go.
42:53 -  This tenacity, this demand for ultimate blessing from God, that will not be content with just a cheaply passing thing is maybe the most significant thing that is instinctive in Jacob and is the key to the becoming of the Israel of God.
43:15 -  I will not let you go unless you bless me. And so he said to him, what is your name? He said, Jacob. Why did he ask him that? Doesn't the man know his own name?
43:29 -  But of course, unlike our present generation, names then were fought with meaning. Jacob is exactly the statement of the man and his character. What God was calling him to review before he changes that name is one last review
43:47 -  of what your name means and what your conduct has been, what your character, what your mode of living and being has been till this moment. Rub it in. Rub your face into the grit of that.
43:58 -  What is your name? How have you proceeded till now? Then the man said, you shall no longer be called Jacob but Israel, for you have striven with God and with man and have prevailed.
44:14 -  That's what the name Israel itself means, an overcomer, one who has striven with God and with man, a prince with God and with men. Then Jacob asked him, please tell me your name.
44:29 -  He said, why is that you ask my name? And there he blessed him. I've never thought about this before, whether Jacob's asking was a condition for the blessing, that there's something significant in wanting to know
44:45 -  the name of the one with whom he's wrestling, was wanting to know the essence of the one with whom he's wrestling. He was not just looking for a tag. Is your name Jack Bill?
44:56 -  I mean, what's the convenient thing that I have to speak to identically? He wants to know what is in your name. You've had me to reflect what's in my name. What's in your name?
45:08 -  I want to know you as you are. I will not let you go. That's the blessing that I want. I don't want just prosperity. I want an appropriation, an acquisition of yourself as God.
45:21 -  Then there he blessed him. Then he blessed him. And what a strange blessing. He touched the socket of his thigh and he crippled a man. He was permanently disabled for the rest of his life.
45:34 -  Call that a blessing? How many do we have in this room this morning who limp? And Adam, I'm not talking about a physical disablement.
45:47 -  I mean something much more deep than that. I mean that God has touched you in the nexus of your own authority, power and ability. I remember I visited a Jewish millionaire in New Jersey.
46:03 -  I took my son David because he had a stable of horses, race horses. And he had become a believer. And we had met, he invited him to spend the night. And we had an intensive evening about the Lordship of Jesus
46:17 -  and how far this Jewish new convert would go. Artie said, if the Lord wanted the stable of horses, he has it. He wants my business, my corporations, he has it.
46:29 -  He said, so long as I can retain the ability again to obtain through my wit. I've never forgotten that. He's still Jacob.
46:46 -  He's not yet been touched in the place of his own resourcefulness, his own ability, his own strength. The hip in the human anatomy, especially with a male, is a significant place. I'm still remembering my trip to the Philippines and a hot shot young pastor
47:05 -  on his way up the ladder of ministerial success on the platform full of swagger. You know what my message was? Jesus on the back of an ass upon which never man sat coming down the precipitous Mount of Olives
47:20 -  in a caricature and joke of this man on this little thing who had the option of its mother and did not employ it. He said, you'll find an ass and its cult. Bring them to me.
47:36 -  If anyone stops you, say that the Lord has need of them. Well, they found it and they brought them. But instead of using the adult animal practiced in the bearing of the weight of a man,
47:48 -  he chose that upon which never man sat and coming down. Have you ever walked down the Mount of Olives? You cannot walk down and maintain your dignity.
48:01 -  It's just that's precipitous. Imagine coming on this little animal and jerking and faulting and people crying, Hosanna, salvation is of God.
48:14 -  They laid their wraps, their cloaks in the way. Hosanna, your King shall come to you lowly and meek. Your King coming to you is salvation.
48:23 -  But that's your King. That's his character. That's his name. And he's showing it in the absurd, ridiculous way in which he enters his glorious capital city. No motorcycle cavalcade.
48:40 -  Man's pride. The hip is where we pack our suitor. Not so much to employ it, but just to have it hang there.
48:49 -  We like the heft of it. And we like to stick our thumbs and our belt around there. And by the way, that's also our sexual prowess, the area of our potency, our masculinity.
49:03 -  And this man was wearing, on the Philippines that night, a cell phone. Is that what they call them? You don't know why everybody, that communication is so vital,
49:14 -  that he was expecting a call in the middle of the service. But he had it in a holster right on his hip. And I could see, this is prophetic seeing what that meant to him.
49:27 -  His self-esteem, his macho, a man who is on the way up the ladder of religious success, and people look up to him with awe and adoration. That thing was a statement.
49:39 -  That's where God touched Jacob, right there. That's where we need to be touched. Not just for the moment, but permanently.
49:48 -  An enduring affliction, permanently crippled, which is to say, you can never again base your life and your dependency on your macho ability, but on the God who has crippled you.
50:05 -  He did cripple me. Huh? He crippled me.
50:08 -  Yeah? Praise the Lord. You're a blessed woman. Hallelujah.
50:13 -  This is, talk about paradigm. This is more than just historical description. This is everlasting description.
50:21 -  This is everlasting validity for the issue of Jacob versus Israel through every generation, and especially in the last days. Unless he has touched us at the nexus of where we have our life, our success, our ability, our confidence, our trust,
50:38 -  we're not yet his, we're yet Jacob. We're willing to make a deal with him, and we'll give him a portion back, but we're still in the saddle, we're still calling the shots in the way that we want to go.
50:49 -  It could even be a religious way, but it's a Jacob way. He's got to nail us right there where we, in fact, have everything. I don't know about physiology.
51:02 -  They say that the blood cells are formed in that same socket. I mean, the Lord who has made us and knows the human body knows where to touch. What a blessing.
51:14 -  Amen. Nobody would welcome that. And he blessed him.
51:24 -  So Jacob called that place Peniel from the Hebrew word meaning the face of God. For I've seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved. Well, your physical life may have been preserved, but your Jacob life has died.
51:42 -  That touch was more than just a crippling, it was an end. You have died when you meet God face to face. That Jacob thing has got to perish, not just be put temporarily aside,
51:53 -  or it will continue to assert itself and make deals and transactions with God. I just shared with a brother recently that the Lord may be engineering the circumstances of his life to bring him from a certain mode of Christian life that is common to many
52:13 -  by which you continue to ask God for help and enablement in the way that you will go, and that somehow the Lord is not answering. I said, well, it may be something like Israel when they lived in the wilderness
52:27 -  by the manna that came down from heaven, but when they came into the land that provision for the immaturity ceased. They had to live in another mode, in another way, from the land itself.
52:38 -  And when we come into the land, we have to live in another mode from God himself. God answering our prayer and God helping us and God giving us was a provision for our infantile state, but it's not intended to be enduring.
52:56 -  Listen, saints, I've been a saint, I've been a believer 35 years. I've been in critical, crucial places. God has audibly spoken to me on platforms, preached across.
53:06 -  When I obeyed him, it was a devastation. People were sprawled out like that all over that room. But the longer that I go on, the fewer the occasions to actually hear God instructing me.
53:17 -  Like this morning, when did I come up with this Jacob thing? It wasn't God saying, no, art, this morning, here's my subject. Or even last night.
53:28 -  It's more like something that kind of wells up within. I mean, it's your thought. It's actually his thought.
53:38 -  But you've come to a place after 35 years where your thought is not distinct from his thought. His thought is your thought. His way is your way.
53:48 -  His impulse is your impulse. His disposition of spirit is your disposition of spirit. For you have no life unto yourself or for yourself independent of him.
53:59 -  It's no longer two entities in some kind of Jacob transaction where one receives and gives back something in return. Jacob has been done away with. And the man is God's.
54:13 -  He's Israel. It's God's very name. And God gives it to him.
54:22 -  I've seen God face to face and yet my life is preserved. The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. The story begins chapters back.
54:32 -  The sun sets on Jacob. The story ends with the sun rising on Israel. He's received a new name because he's received a new character.
54:43 -  And he's received it by imputation, by the grace of God. When he had passed everything over. Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the thigh muscle as on the hip socket.
54:58 -  Because he struck Jacob on the hip socket at the thigh. The end of chapter 33 will conclude our review for today. Verse 18. Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem.
55:13 -  Which is in the land of Canaan on his way from Paddan Aram. And he camped before the city. And from the sons of Hamor Shechem's father he bought for one hundred pieces of money.
55:24 -  The plot of land on which he had pitched his tent. There he erected an altar. And called it El Elohei Israel.
55:35 -  He never had one before. This is his first altar. And there could not have been an altar before.
55:46 -  If you seek to establish an altar of worship while you're yet Jacob is a contradiction in terms. It'll just become musical. It'll just become a kind of personal enjoyment.
55:57 -  One that might affect the atmosphere of a meeting. But it's not an altar, that's an altar of worship. And the name that he gave it describes it.
56:10 -  El Elohei Israel. The God, the God of Israel. The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac has become the God of Israel.
56:21 -  And the proof of it is the altar of God raised up in his new name. The God of Israel. His own authentic worship.
56:34 -  Now possible out of authentic relationship. Because something has happened of an ultimate and radical kind. That has crippled if not killed the former man.
56:45 -  Who is required to have a new name for a new identity. New relationship. And now to take a patriarchal role that will bless all generations.
56:57 -  So we have a choice of this being a nice message. Or a point of crossing. If God gave the impulse for this word.
57:25 -  I have to believe that he's addressing Jacob's. Who have not yet become Israel. Who have not yet sent over all.
57:32 -  Very generous in their transactions with God. But they're still under Jacob's side. And you can tell by your worship.
57:41 -  Your capability of worship. Is it something that just issues out of the spontaneity of your heart. Or is it kind of a dull thud.
57:54 -  In which you sit at the periphery. You can even bang a tambourine. But your spirit is not engaged.
58:02 -  God is not yet your God. That you can worship him. You can enter into the music.
58:08 -  But not to the worship. And if we cannot worship him in spirit and truth. Neither can we serve him.
58:18 -  And that's why Israel is going to go. The nation. Through what it must.
58:23 -  To become the Israel of God. Who will worship him and serve him. And bless the families of the earth.
58:30 -  Not in it's present chutzpah. You know this Jewish word. Not in it's present arrogance.
58:36 -  And self sufficiency. But in it's being crippled. It'll never recover.
58:41 -  It'll always be a diminished. Broken. Bowed over people.
58:46 -  Who have been profoundly humbled by their encounter with God. In the final dealing that yet awaits them. As it awaited their father.
59:03 -  The question for us is to what degree is this an appropriate text for us. Are we the Israel of God. Or are we yet essentially a Jacob people.
59:17 -  So just take a moment to reflect. On what needs to be passed over. What is yet being retained.
59:26 -  That incapacitates you. Disqualifies you is the better word. From a final encounter with God who is waiting.
59:35 -  The moment that he sees. You have sent over all that you have. That you're no longer negotiating.
59:42 -  And transacting. For the benefit that will come to you. If God will help you in the way that you want to go.
59:49 -  You'll meet him. And the truth of that meeting will be. A new ability to worship God.
01:00:00 -  And a more significant ability to serve God. So I want to pray for that. For the Jacobs that might be addressed.
01:00:11 -  Yes I'm still the Jacob. Okay. You needn't be at Beyond Today.
01:00:17 -  I see now there's a difference. We can praise. I can praise our Lord.
01:00:24 -  There's a difference between praise and worship. And I haven't got there yet. I now know I need to build my altar.
01:00:32 -  Oh bless the Lord. You know what? I don't know what blesses me about you.
01:00:36 -  You're just like Jacob in your candid acknowledgement. Of your condition and need. That was his situation also.
01:00:44 -  And God is blessed by that. And will meet you. Hallelujah.
01:00:49 -  This word was for you exclusively. Was worth everything. But you're not the only one.
01:00:54 -  Hallelujah is upon me. I sat here. I was outside of the circle.
01:01:00 -  I can't hear you. I was outside of the circle of praise. I knew then something was wrong with my heart.
01:01:10 -  Hallelujah. All praise God. Thank you Lord.
01:01:15 -  Wow you know what my privilege is? Other men may preach sermons. But God employs me for transactions.
01:01:23 -  We've come to an hour where my sermon's starved. No longer the luxury we can afford. We need nuts and bolts transaction with God.
01:01:31 -  The time is short. He's earnest. And if this is his word.
01:01:35 -  I think I can say with a complete confidence. That if you'll forsake every last Jacob dependency. And willing to be humbled.
01:01:42 -  And crippled. Why that crippling? Because it always brings you to the place of continual dependence upon God.
01:01:50 -  Always. You know if I give the impression of look my no hands. People will compliment me.
01:01:58 -  The eloquence of the words. They don't know. They don't know it comes out of such terrible weakness.
01:02:05 -  They don't know that I don't know how to put one word before the next. They don't know that all I had was the name Jacob. And look in the back of the car I was running here over the text again.
01:02:15 -  But no thought of how to bring it. That the God of Israel himself wants to be our enablement in our life. The very impulse and spirit of our being.
01:02:27 -  Oh then you'll worship him for that. That's freedom. That's no more transaction.
01:02:34 -  That's total and utter abandonment that he's waiting for. And that's the witness that will save Israel. They don't have to see themselves mirrored and reflected in the church.
01:02:43 -  That is Jacob like them. Wheeling and dealing. So Lord in Jesus name.
01:02:49 -  If I have been obedient my God. To bring the word of your heart to your people. And you have set the stage.
01:02:56 -  I was surprised to see Byron here this morning. And my brother and others who are here. I didn't know that they would be part.
01:03:02 -  You knew. And this is a word my God. For the Jacob sons and daughters that are in this room.
01:03:08 -  Who have never crossed over Jabbok. Who are still on the other side. Still scheming.
01:03:13 -  Still have their dependencies. They're still insulating and hedging their life about. It's not a radical trust.
01:03:19 -  And are being thrust upon God. That ye though he slay me yet will I trust him. My God.
01:03:25 -  Bring these men and women over. Hear their cry my God. They know that they're being addressed.
01:03:31 -  That this was not a sermon. That this was an appointment for them. And they've had it.
01:03:37 -  And they've been wonderful in their Jacob life. And impressive. And many have complimented them.
01:03:42 -  For the good things that they have done. And the philanthropies. And even the assistance to the church and to its work.
01:03:47 -  But you have not had them. For yourself. As worshippers.
01:03:53 -  Who have their own altar. Their own authentic. Relationship with God.
01:03:59 -  And so I bless the Lord. Affect that today. Make that a transaction today.
01:04:05 -  Hear the cry of their hearts today. They may have come into this room as Jacob. But they're leaving it as the Israel of God.
01:04:11 -  And it will change everything. Everything. So I just invite you.
01:04:17 -  Right where you sit. Don't get eloquent. Don't get long winded.
01:04:23 -  Just a short statement to God. Lord I forsake all. I send them all that I'm alone.
01:04:29 -  No further dependency. You are it. Change me this day.
01:04:35 -  Touch me in the socket. Of where I live. The nexus of my authority.
01:04:41 -  My power. My ability. My positions. My knowledge. My dependencies. Even about you.
01:04:47 -  That you alone. I'll be a stuttering idiot. I'll be incapable of nothing.
01:04:53 -  Unless you are the life of my life. The utterance of my utterance. The speaking of my speaking.
01:04:59 -  The sweetness of my sweetness. I'm nothing. I want to be Israel.
01:05:05 -  A prince with God. Let him hear that saints. And you'll receive it.
01:05:11 -  I just wanted to share a short word. Last night when you spoke. You just brought a reality to a word that the Lord gave me last night.
01:05:19 -  I don't know where the scripture is. But the essence is what a terrible thing. To fall into the hands of a living God.
01:05:29 -  Anyway God gave me that word last night when you were speaking. I didn't really understand it. I was going to share it and I thought no.
01:05:35 -  But the reality that just came to me. As you shared that word. What you just shared.
01:05:41 -  Because I believe the word is for me. And maybe for others. But the truth of the matter is for me.
01:05:47 -  What a terrible thing it is. To fall into the hands of a living God. Because I can't look anywhere but to him.
01:05:53 -  Or anything. I'm only speaking from my own heart. That's a creepy thing.
01:05:59 -  You said enough. You know what the remarkable thing is about the faith? That a word about Jacob.
01:06:05 -  Becomes the vicarious experience of the hero. The vicarious experience of the hero. Who can enter into exactly.
01:06:11 -  The same encounter. With the one who wrestled with Jacob. Through the hearing of the word.
01:06:17 -  And the response to it. And cross and come into. Becoming the Israel of God.
01:06:23 -  That's the remarkable. Nature of scripture. And the preached word.
01:06:31 -  If it's the word of God. That is sent. Not just to inform, instruct or inspire.
01:06:37 -  But to establish. It becomes the event in itself. You can enter in.
01:06:43 -  Through the episode of Jacob. Into that reality. So I invite you to do so.
01:06:49 -  By the faith of your own prayer right now. And you'll leave this place. With a rejoicing.
01:06:55 -  It'll be an entirely new walk. Fought with things that you Never ever imagined.
01:07:01 -  It will eclipse the best you've ever done for God. Go ahead. Hallelujah. Let him hear from you.
01:07:07 -  Thank you. Heavenly Father. I have struggled with this soul.
01:07:23 -  I searched everywhere. I couldn't find God. I gave myself to you.
01:07:29 -  And you have to remain proud of me. I'm Jacob, proud of you. Father.
01:07:35 -  It wasn't to find me for long to come here and thank you for hearing this. I'm happy to talk to you, Father.
01:07:45 -  Thank you. Hallelujah. I pray.
01:07:51 -  With all my heart and spirit that you would touch me. Thank you, Lord. I accept that touched word.
01:07:57 -  I accept that touched word. Thank you, Lord. Only you have the power, my God,
01:08:03 -  to break in and through. I accept you greatly, thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord.
01:08:13 -  I accept your will, my wife, Lord. I accept your will, my wife, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
01:08:19 -  I surrender my all to you. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
01:08:25 -  Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
01:08:35 -  Precious gift. Thank you, my God. Another son for your glory.
01:08:41 -  Thank you, my God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
01:08:53 -  Thank you, Father. Thank you. Thank you.
01:08:59 -  Hallelujah. Father, we thank you. Father, we thank you.
01:09:05 -  Help us to thank you, Lord, in body, mind and soul. Help us, Lord God,
01:09:11 -  to realize the kingdom of God is a physical presence.
01:09:17 -  Help us to come to our altar daily, Lord. Forgive us
01:09:23 -  for what we take for how we walk with you.
01:09:29 -  We don't want to be a jigsaw, Lord. Take us by the hand
01:09:35 -  as you take us that we might walk with you. Thank you, Lord.
01:09:41 -  Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thanks, God's grace.
01:09:47 -  Thank you. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
01:09:53 -  Father, you know what a phony I am, Lord. But you know that
01:09:59 -  all the problems of my mouth are but lies. And every time I said,
01:10:05 -  take it all, Lord, I have to put down and get things in the closet. So, Lord, I see
01:10:11 -  you have to do it, Lord. I just thank you, Lord, that you have that power,
01:10:17 -  you have that power to touch lies, Lord, and bring about
01:10:23 -  how clean it is. I just hand it to you, Lord, because I can't.
01:10:29 -  Take it all, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father.
01:10:35 -  Lord, I surrender every Jacob part of my life to you, Lord.
01:10:41 -  I give it all to you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
01:10:49 -  Father, I pray that you would touch me in my hip socket or
01:10:55 -  and take the need in my life to be self-reliant,
01:11:01 -  to have control over how I
01:11:07 -  and how I come across and how I say things
01:11:13 -  and how I'm seen, Lord. I pray that you would break all of that and
01:11:19 -  keep me completely dependent on you, Lord. Teach me what it means
01:11:25 -  to really not know what's going to happen from moment to moment, just to be satisfied
01:11:31 -  and content with being in you, Lord. I'm far from that and I need that
01:11:37 -  in my life. I just want to be in Israel. No matter what the cost, Lord,
01:11:43 -  I just pray that you give me the strength. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
01:11:49 -  Thank you, Lord. Lord, years ago you had given me a dream and just simply said,
01:11:55 -  die yourself. I'm still struggling with all of that.
01:12:01 -  I just have to thank you that you put me in a situation where everything shuts down,
01:12:07 -  everything stops, everything that I'd like to do stops, and
01:12:13 -  yet you bless so much, Lord, and I've been grumbling and complaining for
01:12:19 -  a long, long time, so my heart is really, it's unfeeling.
01:12:25 -  I can go through the motions and I pray that you would deal with me according to your great
01:12:31 -  mercy, so that I can be a blessing, that there can be life that comes forth,
01:12:37 -  which is your precious life, and that I can fall in love with you again, Lord, like I
01:12:43 -  did when I first gave my heart to you. Thank you, Lord.
01:12:49 -  I just thank you for this word and I pray that it would have affected my life
01:12:55 -  and that my name, unfortunately, does mean Jacob, and I pray that
01:13:01 -  that would change. From this moment. Dear Lord,
01:13:11 -  I know, Lord, that there's no good thing that you want within me and myself. Thanks be to you, Lord,
01:13:17 -  for the deposit that you placed in me, Lord. God, I know that I am bankrupt
01:13:23 -  and myself, but Father, I come alive to you, Lord,
01:13:29 -  and hold me in Lord and I know that you might have your way with me, Lord, as much as we,
01:13:35 -  but the Spirit is strong. Lord, I can't make any promises, Lord, of the old nature because
01:13:41 -  of His testitudes. So God is my Spirit, Father, I commend myself to you,
01:13:47 -  Father, to give you this mission, dear Lord, to do whatever you have to do, Lord, because God is all
01:13:53 -  up to you, God. It's not my efforts, it's your Spirit, Father, it's your goodness,
01:13:59 -  it's your compassion, it's your mercy, Father, that we need you, Lord. Let us not bow to you,
01:14:05 -  let us not bow to the creatures, let us not bow to the human flesh, Lord. Let God just
01:14:11 -  turn to you, Father, in everything, in every situation, Lord. God, fill us with your Spirit, Father.
01:14:17 -  God, may we be so disciplined, Lord, cry over and call upon you, Father,
01:14:23 -  that your Spirit may fill us with your goodness and strength and ask and encourage us, Lord. May the Spirit of humility, Lord,
01:14:29 -  be ours, Lord. May we look at others as better than ourselves, may we not be guilty,
01:14:35 -  may we solve ourselves above the more wretched, Lord, because we're all
01:14:41 -  more wretched, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Bless my brother.
01:14:47 -  Bless my brother. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, my God.
01:14:53 -  Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for teaching me. Thank you for showing me
01:14:59 -  your way. Lord, thank you for showing me that I'm a Jacob. Lord,
01:15:05 -  please forgive me. But, Lord, just continue to teach me
01:15:11 -  and show me the way you'll have me go. Lord, I just ask right now,
01:15:17 -  as I take off my side armor, that you, Lord, give along to teach me
01:15:23 -  and show me your holy way from here on in.
01:15:29 -  That's right. There's no Jesus. Holy name. Amen. Amen.
01:15:35 -  Amen. Amen. I praise you, Lord God Almighty,
01:15:49 -  that as you reveal to me in your precious
01:15:55 -  love that of myself without Jesus, I can do nothing. Absolutely
01:16:01 -  nothing. I don't even take the next breath.
01:16:07 -  You humble us totally to be totally dependent on you, Lord
01:16:13 -  God. You cannot even take the next thought without your enabling.
01:16:19 -  And as our precious Lord Jesus stepped fully into the Father
01:16:25 -  and of himself did nothing, only through God was he enabled.
01:16:31 -  And so, Lord Jesus, you gave us the great promise
01:16:37 -  that we can do all thanks through Christ who strengthens us. And you raise us up
01:16:43 -  to the heavenlies. And you see us in heavenly places. Daily, Lord, you give me those two
01:16:49 -  promises, those two words, straight from Scripture.
01:16:55 -  And it balances me out, Lord God, that I can do nothing of myself,
01:17:01 -  but I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
01:17:07 -  Thank you, Heavenly Father, for balancing me out to walk a straight and narrow path.
01:17:13 -  And, O Lord, let me never feel that I have attained the rest of my thought.
01:17:19 -  In Jesus' holy name. I know the hot is to see on the desperately wicked.
01:17:39 -  Whatever dismal that you need to know to do,
01:17:45 -  please do. I'm trusting you. And I want
01:17:53 -  to trust you fully with all my heart. Do whatever it takes
01:18:03 -  in me. So there's nothing left. Just you.
01:18:35 -  Whatever could be said about Jacob, he would not let the moment pass when he had his opportunity.
01:18:41 -  And I pray that that would be true for you. I will not let you go
01:18:47 -  except you bless me. I am not going to leave this room. I am not going to allow
01:18:53 -  the service to be concluded without transacting with you. I want your blessing.
01:19:01 -  I need your blessing. I want my latter years to be more glorious than the former.
01:19:07 -  And I cannot do that as a Jacob. Don't let him go, Saints.
01:19:15 -  He's here. He'll answer every cry. Humble yourself.
01:19:27 -  Father Latane and I ask that you search my heart.
01:19:33 -  Lord, I'm aware of all of my wicked ways, but I ask you to search those things that I'm not aware of
01:19:39 -  and see if there is any wicked way. Lord, that all of us could be revealed.
01:19:45 -  Lord, all that you've given us. Lord, the strength that cannot be my flesh, but my spirit.
01:19:53 -  Lord, to lay these down and let you crucify every one of these areas that you would put
01:19:59 -  your finger on. Lord, every corner, every crack and crack
01:20:05 -  of the store, just empty everything. Lord, I would ask you to come into my life and to
01:20:25 -  take out every, every Jacob character out of my life.
01:20:33 -  But every conniving manipulator thing
01:20:39 -  where every everything that I want to hold onto from my father,
01:20:47 -  you would take it out and you would wrestle me down so
01:20:53 -  I do become an Israel left. Lord,
01:20:59 -  I give you Jesus. Father, I don't want anything to separate us.
01:21:17 -  Lord, I just pray that you show me to you with me
01:21:25 -  that there won't be any distance between us as long to walk with you.
01:21:35 -  Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Oh, Lord, I too
01:21:41 -  ask that you just search me, Father God. Father God,
01:21:47 -  just, I don't want anything that is not of you, Lord God.
01:21:53 -  If there's any Jacob in me, Father, just let that
01:21:59 -  I might be his. Thank you. Thank you,
01:22:29 -  God. Father, I cry out to you
01:22:47 -  with desperation this day. Thank you.
01:22:55 -  I find that such a depression has settled upon me.
01:23:07 -  Over my back and I can't seem to get through, Lord. I can't cry
01:23:17 -  and I can't laugh. I'm all bottled up inside you. I feel all boarded up
01:23:25 -  and I need to release in my spirit this day, Lord.
01:23:33 -  I call out to you in the name of Jesus. Thank you,
01:23:51 -  God. Thank you, Lord.
01:24:09 -  It must be perceived that if our Jacob life was dignified
01:24:15 -  that it's nonetheless Jacob. So I'm especially grateful
01:24:23 -  that Jack has prayed because if you'll allow me, Jack, I can almost say Jake.
01:24:29 -  It's been a dignified Jacob life and an honorific one and I'm sure that you've been applauded and complimented
01:24:35 -  but it's still on that other side and that the Lord is wanting that qualitative
01:24:41 -  coming over and coming through as a son of Israel. They'll change everything. I was waiting
01:24:47 -  for you to pray. And now we can have a real communion saints.
01:24:53 -  God is in the process of restoring the great sacraments. I spoke yesterday about water
01:24:59 -  baptism that has become in modern times a mere getting wet. The most profound
01:25:05 -  transaction that God makes available for man is to enter into his death and to be raised to notice of life.
01:25:11 -  And the sacrament of the Lord's table called communion has
01:25:17 -  become for many a little plastic glass with a wafer
01:25:23 -  waiting for the signal to take it together with others with whom they have no relationship. It's almost a mark.
01:25:29 -  And it mediates nothing. It brings nothing. God gave this as a life giving
01:25:35 -  provision because we who are sons and daughters of Israel know that we cannot
01:25:41 -  go on without him. We need to be renewed and enabled. We need the spirit of his life, the substance of his
01:25:47 -  life, the character of his life. I'll just share a little private secret. I take communion daily
01:25:53 -  by myself. In my early morning devotional time I've got a little wine
01:25:59 -  and I've got a piece of matzah I keep breaking a little piece of up. I take a mini communion every morning. You know
01:26:05 -  I'm making a statement to God. I can't make it through this day. Yes I've got 130 something IQ.
01:26:11 -  I think so I had. I've got this. But I cannot. I need your life. And not only
01:26:17 -  your life and its energy and its power. I need the character of your life. For me to affect a humility
01:26:23 -  is a grotesque joke. Humility is God. It's what you are in yourself. You're
01:26:29 -  the king who's meek and lowly and as I eat of this flat bread that is unleavened
01:26:35 -  look how uncombed. There's nothing inflated or pompous about it. I ask that the character of your
01:26:41 -  humility and meekness be transfused and come into me with the very eating.
01:26:47 -  The spirit of your life the substance of your life the character of life. Because a man is
01:26:53 -  what he eats. So Lord we break this bread. Holy
01:26:59 -  great sacrament and your great wisdom that foresaw the millennia ahead
01:27:05 -  and the desperate necessity of your saints especially of the last days to have the strength of God
01:27:11 -  the power, the enablement, the mind of the Lord, the wisdom, the insight, the meekness, the
01:27:17 -  disposition of spirit, the sweetness the firmness whatever the moment
01:27:23 -  requires in God it's got to be by God or it cannot be unto God. It'll be a self-glorifying
01:27:29 -  rather than the glorification of the Holy One of Israel himself. Lord you heard these transactions
01:27:35 -  and these prayers they're real and let this be a first communion in the new life
01:27:41 -  as the sons and daughters of Israel who are now sealing with the covenant of the cup
01:27:47 -  and the taking of the bread the affirmation of their word and prayer and you're going to give them
01:27:53 -  now the enablement my God that is given exclusively to the sons and daughters of Israel
01:27:59 -  to live by you that our worship will not be the issue of our loudspeakers or our musicality
01:28:05 -  but very God himself sweet singer of Israel himself having
01:28:11 -  voice through the life totally yielded. Lord let there be a
01:28:17 -  qualitative difference in everything because what is our house fellowship in the last
01:28:23 -  analysis different than other than the church down the block whose architecture may be a little bit different but so what
01:28:29 -  whether we're sitting on couches or pews unless the character and the truth of what
01:28:35 -  has changed is real it's just a reiteration of the same thing in another format
01:28:41 -  the fact that it's a house doesn't change anything it can become just as religious you've called
01:28:47 -  us to something more so bless this bread Lord bless each
01:28:53 -  one who breaks and partakes give them give them
01:28:59 -  the substance of your life your character you are the true Israel of God
01:29:05 -  and we can only be it my God by virtue of that union and the enablement that is yourself
01:29:13 -  bless the cup my God the cup of covenant we thank you
01:29:19 -  my God for the covenant of the exchanged life that you
01:29:25 -  who knew no sin became sin that we who knew no righteousness can become the righteousness of God
01:29:31 -  in you so seal the transaction of today
01:29:37 -  and let the spirit of your life which is the spirit of giving of outpouring of self sacrifice
01:29:43 -  be taken right up and into our own spirit and life
01:29:49 -  bless the cup bless the bread thank you Lord
01:30:05 -  those who want a separate glass there is a number of them on the table I wouldn't have provided that
01:30:13 -  one cup thank you Lord if for some reason
01:30:23 -  your spouse is not here eat and drink for her that's the one life
01:30:35 -  want to pray something sing something feel free
01:30:45 -  it's a holy sacrament all of that stupid Catholic
01:30:53 -  Protestant controversy that has reduced the sacrament to an emblem
01:30:59 -  and robbed it of its reality as the substance and spirit
01:31:05 -  of the life of God that needs to be done with hallelujah
01:31:11 -  so we bless you Lord bless you Lord thank you Lord
01:31:19 -  thank you Lord feel the surge of the Lord's life with that eating and drinking
01:31:25 -  taking in something more than natural elements something more than a symbol
01:31:31 -  himself thank you Lord precious God on high
01:31:39 -  a communion of the saints with you and with each other Lord
01:31:45 -  let that be the foundation of their fellowship not the issue of structure and leadership
01:31:51 -  doctrine but union communion
01:31:57 -  with God and with men the sons and daughters of God thank you Lord
01:32:03 -  hallelujah and I'm joined with them in this we're one together, hallelujah
01:32:11 -  thank you Lord thank you Lord on the basis of
01:32:23 -  this meat and drink we can make it to the Mount hallelujah
01:32:29 -  Mount Zion the city of God the kingdom of God
01:32:35 -  and the strength of this meat and this drink and truth
01:32:41 -  thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Lord
01:32:47 -  we're willing to bear your limp and we count it not a shame but an honor
01:32:53 -  and a privilege my God while others may boast in their human accomplishment
01:32:59 -  and attainment we're willing to be looked upon and even scorned for limping
01:33:05 -  that accept your life the strength that courage the word with silent or quiet with meek or unobserved
01:33:11 -  and content three minutes thank you Lord all praise your great name
