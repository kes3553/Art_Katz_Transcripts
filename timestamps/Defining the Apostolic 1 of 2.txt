Defining the Apostolic 1 of 2

00:00 -  that which is not sent of God cannot accomplish the purposes of God and that which he sends he empowers so we're just going to examine the anatomy of sending the root of apostolicity by one of the first examples given in Scripture and
00:17 -  not even the New Testament but the old namely the commissioning and the sending of Moses out of the burning bush so Lord we know that you're jealous over that word it's a word that designates yourself as the high priest
00:34 -  and the Apostle of our confession and we know that the church is built on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets and we're asking my God for a renewal of the depths of the meaning of that word for we say with one heart and
00:51 -  one soul that we desire to attain to it my God not that we might all be called to it but we want to be part my God of what makes that up the configuration of things apostolic that makes the church the church so grant us my God insight
01:11 -  revelation and understanding and confront us by the text and meet us my God in the text in the depths of the vicarious possibilities my God that are in what is described there between Moses and you at the burning bush we bless you
01:31 -  learn we thank you for the privilege and we look to you now for an unveiling by your spirit in Jesus name amen so let's look at Exodus 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to
01:50 -  the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was
02:04 -  not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said
02:24 -  here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is holy ground moreover he said I'm the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of
02:40 -  Jacob and Moses hid his face where he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters for I know their sorrows
02:55 -  and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and Hittites and
03:11 -  the Amorites and Perizzites and the Hittites and the Jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I
03:27 -  will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out
03:42 -  of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when there has brought forth the people out of Egypt you shall serve God upon this mountain Moses said unto God behold when
03:58 -  I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the God of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus
04:12 -  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am have sent me unto you and God said moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac the God of
04:26 -  Jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations amen well I haven't counted the number of times that the word sent is employed by five times well that's no coincidence either it would do
04:45 -  us well just to underline the word sent sent sent sent sent the root of a apostolos sent one so what can we glean by this encounter with God and what principles have an eternal validity that are not just an Old Testament phenomenon
05:11 -  but have an abiding application that would give us an insight into him whom God sends why did this take place where it did on the backside of the desert and why was there a 40-year preparation in the wilderness that preceded it and why
05:35 -  did God wait for Moses to turn aside to see before he called him what if he had not turned the whole subsequent heilsgeschichte which is the German word that means salvation history English doesn't have a word for it would
05:52 -  have been lost this one critical point that this man turned aside to see when God saw that he turned aside to see he called him out of the midst of the burning bush Moses Moses there's something so critical this is the whole
06:12 -  pivot everything that I'm asking comes in finally to this vortex this pivotal one critical thing what he saw that Moses turned aside to see he called him we're going to explore that why is that the whole pivotal turning point that has
06:35 -  to do with the commissioning of Moses and if he had passed on by and had chosen not to turn aside to see what then would have been the subsequent history of the faith what would have been the deliverance of Israel out of
06:49 -  Egypt and if there had been no deliverance what would have been the likelihood of the messianic line that had its expression in Jesus to have come to the fulfillment of bringing Kim into the earth you can't I'm not saying
07:09 -  enough I'm just hinting at the enormous weight of what impinged on a single moment's obedience a single moments freely rendered act that could not be compelled God didn't even tell him to turn aside to see something out of the
07:29 -  man himself something of what the man is maybe at the heart of what the man is was critical at that juncture and if God does not find that in us we can forget any kind of apostolic commissioning sending or doing so we want
07:49 -  to invest ourselves in this and lay it bare and try to understand what what is contained here altogether precious one of the questions I'm going to ask is what parallel do you see between the commissioning of Paul and the
08:13 -  commissioning of Moses two great Apostles if I can say that two great master builders two men who were key to the purposes of God to bring the people up and out of slavery and into a land flowing with milk and honey it's not
08:31 -  enough to deliver out it's it's also to bring in it's not just to arrest a people from the Egyptians but to confront the Pharaoh which is ultimate confrontation what does the Pharaoh represent Satan right so this is the
08:53 -  Moses who had 40 years earlier sought out of his own self-initiated conduct to bring good to his people and it eventuated in the death of one Egyptian hastily buried in the sand and Moses's requirement to flee that brought them
09:12 -  into this wilderness and 40 years later comes the moment of encounter and the true fulfillment of his calling you know I would ask to what degree must failure proceed a true appropriation of one's calling and if that's true was it
09:38 -  true for Paul and is it true for us and are we willing for the humiliation of failure out of our best well-meaning intentions that God himself will allow and establish in order that out of the humiliation and the debris and death of
09:57 -  that failure the mortification and the humiliation can be formed the man that God can send that probably could not have been formed in any other way there's something about failure particularly when it's born out of the best
10:13 -  well-meaning intentions to serve God that does a depth of work in the human soul that nothing else can obtain you say well why haven't more of us failed because we have not sought we've not had apostolic intention we've not had large
10:32 -  intentions for God and we've played it close to the vest we've been timid and nothing ventured nothing gained and to avoid the humiliation of failure we have not attempted bravely to succeed we've just kind of gotten by so I like
10:53 -  something about the largeness of soul that is to be seen both in Paul and Moses it's that largeness of soul in Paul that was not satisfied that this heresy called the way be allowed to exist but sought authorization from the religious
11:17 -  class of his time to seek out and to imprison and to persecute this heretical body can you see that if if if Paul or soul were more of a come see come saw well these guys will pass away I doubt if he would have been apostolic timber
11:43 -  T I M B R E not T I M B E R you know that word it was a qualification he was in error as as Moses was in error but the error was born out of an intensity of heart for God and when God will find such a one as that even in his era
12:08 -  there's more potential for an enemy of God with that kind of heart than those who purport to be his friends who have not that intensity and will just drift and get by and whose lives are completely lackluster and undistinguished
12:24 -  for God never threatened by failure because they never attempt largely to succeed so there's a remarkable correlation between Paul and Moses and I'm wondering if that's not true in and other men of an apostolic kind Peter
12:43 -  failed colossally dismally but out of that great failure came a great apostle so maybe we're to take a look at that failure in chapter 2 in verse 11 it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto his
13:07 -  brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand what what can you
13:24 -  learn from that that shows that though Moses himself was called of God and in Stephen's statement in Act 7 talks about that he thought that he was called to be their deliverer that what is indicated here is a man not yet qualified to be it
13:44 -  however well-meaning what does that statement show that he yet lacks as good exegetes as those who draw the meaning out of what is spoken in these verses he looked this way and that and when he saw no man he did what he did what's lacking
14:06 -  there his whole posture was horizontal he saw he acted he looked this way and that way he saw no man but there's no consideration of looking up there's no consideration of God and merely because you see something that needs to be
14:27 -  rectified are you justified in doing it it's probably nothing more inimical that's that means opposed to the purposes of God than the well-meaning intentions of men perpetrated in their own religious and human zeal this is so
14:46 -  evident it was so evident with a soul that had to fail in his zeal to protect the interests of God that he found himself persecuting God it's evident with Moses why is it not evident to the church I would say something like this
15:02 -  something about the whole structure of church life and the necessity to perform something to justify its existence and its perpetuation compels it to act without waiting there's no greater death than waiting and waiting is at the heart
15:26 -  of priestliness I don't know if we'll speak about this in these days but we need to you'll have to come back for another two and a half week session but after all of the things that constituted the ordination of priests and they are
15:41 -  mind-rending and exacting and would drive a man up the wall in the fastidious attention to detail of washings and and and blood and and garments and all of that whole procedure the last days the last requirement was
16:00 -  waiting seven days at the door of the tent of meeting they did not commence their priestly activity until seven days of waiting were fulfilled what does the number seven and wife completion complete waiting complete for what for
16:21 -  dying that's where what God is don't don't be numerical don't don't be American and and quantitative in your in your mindset seven is a symbolic and significant number of completion and what was completed was the last dying of
16:43 -  not man's evil or carnality but his well-meaning religious intention to do for God and until that dies is there any true priestly service and if it's not priestly how is it apostolic Jesus is the high priest and the Apostle of our
17:09 -  confession the first proceeds the last impatience self-will religious ambition the necessity to do and to be seen doing to be recognized and to be acknowledged is death to the purposes of God yes you may have slain an Egyptian
17:31 -  but so what what has come of it but your own expulsion and flight so the partial answer to the question why haven't the churches recognize this principle there's something about the makeup of the of the modern church the
17:51 -  rest in church and especially the American church that is impatient to perform and to do I mean how else does it justify itself and if it's not doing and not performing and not having a program how do you pacify the
18:06 -  congregation why should they continue to come there's got to be some kind of an action some kind of a program what are you doing I think the most taunting mock that you can put to a church or to its leadership is what are you doing and
18:23 -  I think it's the mock that we had to bear here in our earliest years when there was no doing but just simply knocking about and wrestling out the issues of faith and life and community well what are you doing and how much
18:39 -  support did we lose because we were not doing and not performing so this is a great foundational priestly principle so let's just let this register Moses is a called one maybe we ought to look at that and not just paraphrase it but look
19:02 -  at the Holy Spirit statement of that in Act 7 in Stevens summary of the history of Israel you guys don't mind if I don't rush this like we take the rest of the week just to work our way through this it could change our lives where is that
19:29 -  it's x7 anybody find it yet 22 okay Moses was educated okay let's start from 20 in which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house three months and when he
19:48 -  was cast out Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words indeed and in deeds and when he was full 40 years old it came into his heart to
20:03 -  visit his brethren the children of Israel let's just let's not rush let's pause let's let the sink seep into our spirits full 40 years old is not yet 80 years old maybe full humanly full of human sap and human vigor the very thing
20:28 -  that needs to die if God is to be all in all and be the actual performer of the apostolic works through those when he sends in in this 80th year when God confronts Moses at the burning bush and sends him what does Moses say about that
20:49 -  that we've already read who am I that you should send me he's a nebuchadnezzar he's a nebush you know that word a broken one a man who has no assurance of his qualification he has been completely emptied out of all of his human
21:18 -  qualification which was supreme and sublime both genealogically being a Hebrew of the Hebrews and of the priestly tribe and also a prince in Egypt and versed in all of their wisdom and knowledge and yet 40 years after he
21:38 -  was full the same man confronted by God and sent says who am I that you should send me how many people think that Moses is just being self with deprecating you know is this a man who is really emptied of himself has not a wit of confidence
22:07 -  that he could perform anything let alone deliver an entire people out of bondage I want to say that everything that I understand about God would make makes me to make this statement no man more qualified than him who believes in his
22:27 -  deepest heart that he's without qualification and maybe the whole preliminary work of God is to disqualify us before we can be qualified did you put that in your nose isn't it a paradox and isn't it contrary getting back to
22:49 -  question why doesn't the church understand this to the whole religious the whole religious mindset it's absolutely wasteful here's a man full of vigor at the age of 40 ready to do great things for God how many of us are
23:05 -  chomping at the bit and ready to go to make our mark for God and God does not think it lavish wasteful or extravagant to give him another 40 years of waiting in the wilderness till he's completely emptied out and then he calls him this
23:28 -  is classic saints I can't tell you how grateful I am for this sending of God of Moses out at burning bush it is altogether timeless in all of the profound principles of God that have to do with sending that have to do with
23:48 -  that which is apostolic okay back in x7 when he was filled 40 years old came to his heart to visit his brethren seeing one of them suffer one he defended him avenged him that was repressed multi-Egyptian here's the key verse first
24:07 -  25 where he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them but they understood not doesn't that sound like a bit of the upstart of presumption presumption that a man who is assured of a call and
24:25 -  was he called yes sure he was called but it was not yet time to fulfill it so here are a few things to take into our consideration merely because you see something that deserves to be rectified or made made right is not a
24:45 -  justification necessarily to perform it you cannot act in response to need you cannot act in response to need that will be the last day's deception of the church shouldn't we be doing something look at this need and look at that need
25:10 -  or how about that need and we'll be running off all over the place like chickens without a head mediating to needs in the text that we read to begin with Moses is not sent because he sees the need who saw the need God they're
25:32 -  crying has ascended up to me I have seen the reflection therefore I send you you don't go on the basis that you have seen it you go on the basis that I have sent you what a difference and what a salvation from the ambiguity of running
25:55 -  here and there and you and hinder and young so many good things that need to be done so many needful things shouldn't I be doing something those that are led by the spirit these are the sons of God and it's going to be a tremendous
26:12 -  temptation to see whether we are that kind of son what if the spirit does not bid you to intervene you see it it cries out to you you're well able to perform something but the spirit has not indicated or signified that you should
26:32 -  to what will you respond particularly when others are watching to see what your response will be after all you're a leader in the body of Christ and you know you're Godly and men are looking to you to do something and if you don't do
26:53 -  it what will be the reproach for your failure and how much of that is consciously or unconsciously a profound factor in motivating us to do I'll give you a supreme example of what a son of God is that when Jesus heard that his
27:14 -  friend what's his name Lazarus was sick he remained two days longer where he was sufficient for his friend to die while all of his disciples looked on hearing that Lazarus was sick and knowing that Bethany was only a stone's throw from
27:35 -  Jerusalem where Jesus's life was threatened and right away put two and together and thought our master is a coward and is afraid to risk his neck even to deliver his friend because it would put him in a place of jeopardy and
27:52 -  Jesus answered them not a word so you know what this is beginning to show us the depth of character apostolic character that is wholly indifferent to how men perceive you and what they expect of you and that you can be
28:15 -  obedient to God by not acting even though it's going to bring a necessary reproach that cannot be explained and until you are that kind of man you're not yet God's men who can be sent the question is where do you become that on
28:40 -  the back side of the desert so while God waited for Moses an additional 40 years Israel continued to be afflicted an additional 40 years and God did not count that as being wasteful nor extravagant either he allowed an entire
28:59 -  nation to suffer for yet another generation waiting for the moment chosen of God for his own divine action this is not only a revelation of the man it's a revelation of the God who calls and sends the man and do we know that
29:17 -  God in that way and until we do how then shall we be sent for what will we how will we represent him and make him known if we do not know him as he is an apostle is one sent in the place of another he's representing God not his
29:40 -  thought about him but how he in fact himself is that's an expensive knowledge and so all of these things had to be waited upon for God and think of the massive suffering of what was involved during that whole time of waiting and
30:05 -  God did not think it extravagant to allow it what would we think because we are expedient and utilitarian and want to get it done now because our way is not his way nor our thoughts his thoughts we are operating more out of the temper
30:29 -  of modern things then of the timeless and the eternal God who has a far different view about suffering than we God will not send someone who's half baked in the understanding of himself because what is he going to convey what
30:49 -  is an apostle what does an apostle bring when he comes why why why is the apostle the foundation of the church because he's he's clever and knows the scriptures and those church government and how to set up or how to deal with
31:06 -  issues of sin and however those things may be true what would you say is that distinctive single and greatest character or characteristic or trait of an apostle that makes him foundational to the church the foundation
31:24 -  of the church without which there is no church that is church is the knowledge of God as he is in fact in himself and not as we think him to be how many have such a knowledge and you can understand that that knowledge is not cheap does
31:47 -  not come easily and takes a lifetime or years to obtain at the hand of God through trial through suffering through failures that are permitted through humiliations and defeats don't you think that Moses himself reflected on the fact
32:07 -  that is 40 years later and Israel is still in bondage suffering that much longer and where is the God that allows that and how is he just and where is his righteousness and why doesn't he alleviate the ills of his people and
32:25 -  isn't he their covenant-keeping God anyone who has not wrestled with these questions cannot know God if you have subscribed to some glib little well you know that's God and you know and not wrestled with the theodicy of God and
32:45 -  the righteousness of God and the judgments of God and why he allows suffering and how do we reconcile I'm not saying you would have come to an answer but something in your kishkas something in your gut that burrows in and
33:00 -  wants to understand the enigma of God and is not satisfied with mere simple creedal statements and God loves men like that who wrestle with him isn't that Jacob with with the lure that the stream Jack Jabak and many of us are not being
33:23 -  sent because we've not wrestled because we're satisfied with a patsy notion of God that may be technically correct but it's not true we do not know him as we ought and until we do if we were sent what would we perform so our mistake is
33:45 -  to think that because there's the calling that it requires an immediate fulfillment and in that I want to say that the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet that you may know something and be called for something or
34:01 -  have a revelation of something but it's not yet the moment of God's time to express it and can you patiently hold it until that time is one of the tests that somehow God is pleased to perform from the American and modern mentality would
34:21 -  think well why not just give the calling when it's time to perform it why give it in advance and then call for it at a much later time why put the man through all kinds of inward struggles and wrestlings and didn't God call me and
34:35 -  how come I failed why didn't he just expedite it then and give the calling of the fulfillment right at the same time what served by giving a calling well in advance and then requiring it at a much later time very what served in a prophet
34:53 -  holding something that he's not yet free to release though God has given it to him I just can't get at this what happens to a man when he has to hold something for a length of time and even without an indication of when that will
35:10 -  be alleviated can you see something like a teabag seeping in a pot seeping and how long live and how long do I hold this it's you know it's in my bones it's waiting for expression when when comes to fulfillment what why does God allow
35:28 -  that that's what I'm getting at what's what takes place it's like substantially and inwardly that somehow serves the purposes of God I'll just say something about let patience have its perfect work and I
35:42 -  don't think that patience is one of the more celebrated virtues of modern life impatience is much more characteristic how about the fact that Moses is 40 years on the other side of the desert is that just a coincidence why 40 what
36:00 -  what's the significance of that number it's the time of trial and testing so we need to respect the extraordinary preparation of a man for service because if we don't respect it in Moses will we respect it in ourselves and will we will
36:26 -  we be willing to submit to waiting and to conditions of trial and preparation for a true service when all the world and the religious world clamors for action I mean the doors are open they read the the communist regime has
36:47 -  collapsed people have been for 70 years in atheism wide open territory let's go and going we have so there's much to be said for waiting and everything to be said for ascending let's let's look at that in three chapter three Moses kept
37:17 -  the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb what do you think that the first angelic pronouncement from heaven that this day
37:33 -  is born unto you a Savior even Christ the Lord came to those who tended the flock am I asking a an asinine question to a bunch of moderns who have never had anything to do with sheep at all is there something in God's heart that is
38:01 -  tender to those who watch the flock by night who are dutiful faithful unprepossessing you know that shepherding sheep was the most disgraceful vocation in Egypt there was nothing lower in Egyptian value than tending
38:23 -  flocks and for 40 years that's what Moses did he tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law how was that because there was nothing better to do or was that the best that he could have done what what is served in monotony in regularity
38:45 -  in something that is predictable that has no variation that lacks any kind of flamboyance or charismatic excitement but requires a steadfast patient faithful performance of something small and unprepossessing day after day after
39:07 -  day after day and if Moses had not done that would he have been qualified to bring the flock of God which is Israel out of Egypt was the one a necessary preliminary to the other and if so are we willing to serve our apprenticeship
39:25 -  in the things that are ordinary unseen unglorious undistinguished and show ourselves faithful in that in order to be faithful in the other so I don't think that this is just historical happenstance I think that this is the
39:49 -  sublime wisdom and requirement of God it comes out of circumstance it comes out of flight it comes out of Moses fleeing from Egypt and finding himself in Midian and into an economy that has at its heart the tending of sheep but it
40:07 -  was God's exquisite and perfect and necessary preparation for a man who was a prince in Egypt and I can't say that I have ever known this vocation but I'll never forget my one experience when I lived in Israel as an immigrant and
40:27 -  wanted to seek the Lord and in Carmel in in the mountains there in Galilee where they put up this experimental community I went up into the highest reaches what watching the Sun come up to commune with God great fiery red orb of the Sun came
40:50 -  up meanwhile to get up there my flesh was so prick and and cut and bleeding from the brambles and thorns and thickets that I didn't realize were there that that topography is cursed there's no more rugged severe topology than what
41:10 -  is Israel I mean it was rugged just to navigate my way up then I finally sat on a rock and I'm waiting to commune with God in that wonderful quiet the Sun is coming up and with it almost instantly the heat of a furnace and with it the
41:26 -  buzzing of flies for I found that I was sitting in a place that shepherds had occupied and it was laden with sheep dropping everywhere and so I had a little taste my romantic notion of communing with God dissipated I was
41:44 -  unable to be I was distracted by the buzzing of flies and swan I was wearing shorts I came home with lumps like that on my legs but it was because of what attends sheep how do you like 40 years of that so I have a great admiration for
42:03 -  men who are in undistinguished unsung places but who watch the flock by night faithful in the homely and inconspicuous service of God and somehow feel that there's a necessity for that before the things that are glorious and that this
42:26 -  is not something that we should pass over as just being incidental or coincidental but something in the prescribed wisdom of God for the man being prepared for sending how about the backside of the desert he led the flock
42:43 -  to the backside of the desert where the mount of God is to be found and only there so you can go to all your charismatic conferences and all of the renowned speakers for your great experience in God and come back with
43:04 -  ashes in your mouth because you've not gone to the backside you've gone to the front side and the mouth of God is not located there anybody know what Horeb means it means dry desiccated barren and impoverished that's the mount of God
43:27 -  that's what God occupies that's where he's to be found and how many people have a stomach to seek him in that place what to be found there I don't know why he led the sheep to the backside because what does backside imply I mean yeah
43:49 -  come on speaks for itself you know I once described some town in America as the anus of America the backside is unsavory you guys help me give me some adjectives unbecoming and barren nothing spectacular the front side is where the
44:18 -  action is it's the front side that's lush is the front side that has all the glitter and the big stars and the names and the activity and this is where the action is who's gonna seek the backside hmm where the mount of God is it was
44:38 -  then and it is now I can't tell you how much reproach and stink I had to bear in coming to this place living in Plainfield New Jersey 20 miles away from two and a half million Jews and coming to this nothing place out of a still
45:02 -  small voice that seemed totally illogical to leave such a harvest field and to come to a place where we were the only Jews and nothing in this barren location so what would be the equivalent for yourself and do you have a stomach
45:29 -  for it can you be weaned away from the front side with all of the four color brochures that come in your mailbox I've got boxes of Christian mailing I tell you it'll warm us in the winter with invitations and appeals and the
45:47 -  conference of the year and the man of God and the now word of the prophet and blah blah blah there's no end and the few of them that I've attended I've come away with the taste of ashes in my mouth highly inflated what's the word hyped
46:04 -  up but not the revelation of the God of Moses so here's a statement about the man who led his flock to that place didn't avoid it didn't circumvent it didn't look for a lusher place I don't know what was in his heart that that he
46:26 -  navigated that way and whoever our pastors among us today or who will be will you lead your flock on the backside and you'll not be speaking to them what is in vogue what is the present charismatic fad you'll not be speaking
46:47 -  about church growth and power evangelism and getting on the bandwagon of of the things that the body of Christ is now excited about but the Lord will lead you in another way you'll be talking about the cross and death to self and self
47:04 -  denial I don't know what you'll be in the barren place can you lead your flock there all of this is preliminary qualification for the encounter with God and descending so he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to
47:27 -  the mountain of God even to horror one of the rare uses of that name which in Hebrew means dry and destitute barren and unprepossessing sign I has the word sign I invokes another image a mountain wreathed with flame mighty but the sense
47:50 -  of God's presence but horrid there's some little mean lowly kind of a nothing which is not only where God has found but what God himself is why is he found there for the very same reason that he's born in stables and has the inception of
48:14 -  his kingdom with a man who dribbles in his beard and is joined by the indebted and the disappointed in a cave this is God and if you don't know that how shall you be sent what are you going to communicate and it's only this knowledge
48:35 -  of God that brings men out of bondage for after all what is Egypt it's the antithesis Egypt is lush Egypt is carnality Egypt is fresh gratification God is horrid dryness arid seemingly seeming disappointment nothing that
49:00 -  tantalizes tantalizes the flesh the God of humility it's only the revelation of that God that can save men out of Egypt that somehow the in the seemingly inferior thing is alone calculated to destroy the thing that seems to have all
49:24 -  the marbles that the weaknesses God is greater than the strength of men and the foolishness of God is greater than the wisdom of men Egypt was wisdom it was civilization in the uttermost horrid is something entirely antithetical opposite
49:44 -  a better question yet anybody who is willing to know the backside of the desert we're not going to leap into the burning bush until we first come to the other place it's a dying even to contemplate this didn't that indicate
50:03 -  that like Moses he knew from an earlier time his calling and yet there was no release or fulfillment throughout his entire maturity until his 30th year now don't you think he was qualified when he was 21 wasn't he at the height of his
50:22 -  and manhood and full of sap and ready and able to do for God and fulfill the father's will but that was not the time of the call how about Elijah you don't hear a cotton-picking whisper about the man until suddenly he's introduced in
50:41 -  first Kings 16 or 17 in confrontation with they have so evidently there's a pattern here the man that God uses now there's use and use I'm talking about ultimate use ultimate deliverance ultimate confrontation you're not going
51:02 -  to be dealing with a few Egyptians you're confronting the Pharaoh you're not ameliorating Israel's present affliction you're delivering them out of bondage and not only out but you're bringing them into a land that flows
51:16 -  with milk and honey so what would you say in the light of the this very hour and the time that remains before the conclusion of the age and the magnitude of the tasks that yet await I would say in the light of these things these are
51:36 -  ultimate things God is looking for and shaping men in an ultimate way the great works of God in the last days will come out of the rest of God's will they will not come but then aren't people dying I'm perishing without Christ don't they
51:54 -  need to hear is the same question as isn't Israel being afflicted in bondage yeah God knows it he hears the cry and he sees the need and we have to have a sublime confidence not only in his compassion and mercy but in his
52:15 -  sovereignty and will I think that that will save us from premature being saviors of the world but there's a statement that I've quoted Shelley and you've probably heard it from me many times but you need to hear it anything
52:29 -  that happens anywhere affects everything everywhere and I didn't get I got that from Time magazine some article I was reading on a plane about economics today where the writer said anything that happens anywhere affects everything
52:45 -  everyone said my God if that's true of economics how much true how much more true in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so put that into your spirit anything that happens anywhere affects everything everywhere and that
53:06 -  will save you from self-initiated activity that you think is good that is not coordinate with things appointed by God in time are we ready now to look at the the precious encounter here the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in
53:28 -  a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw
53:48 -  that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I as good students of the word what questions would you put to this text what distinguishes this verse from others
54:10 -  that may have been ignited by spontaneous combustion what other questions your questions are everything why didn't God reveal himself without a bush just just an apparition just like like he did to Joshua art thou for us
54:29 -  or against us neither I'm the Lord I'm the captain of the hosts take off your shoes why didn't he do that for Moses what does Moses require burning bush I'm not so much asking for the answers now I'm asking for the questions we've got
54:46 -  to learn how to probe a text and this is loaded this is loaded so why does God reveal himself in this context what has that got to do with the particular and peculiar sending of Moses how does that relate to the history of Moses of a man
55:09 -  who looked this way and that and buried the Egyptian but never thought to look up what what is God wanting to impress by this kind of revelation of himself and is it a revelation of himself what what is there in a burning bush that
55:23 -  reveals God that is not consumed and what was the key in this episode when Moses turned aside to see was that his own voluntary act was it inevitable curiosity itself would require one looking into it what kind of a looking
55:46 -  did he with what kind of looking did he look and is it more than our ordinary looking is there a looking and a looking is there a faith and a faith is there an obedience and an obedience when a man says here am I is that just an ordinary
56:05 -  well here I am here I am or is that something in which all the stops are pulled out and no matter what you have for me no matter what you'll require me no matter what the consequence for me here am I what evoked this uttermost
56:26 -  consecration to God that we do not see in multitudes of God's charismatic people how many of them have said that with the same intensity and meaning as Moses said it and therefore are yet knocking about in wilderness places and are not yet
56:49 -  sent until God has the whole man lock stock barrel they hear am I there's no sending so how how there was that response of Moses related to the confrontation of God in the midst of the burning bush and why a bush a bush is
57:16 -  the most ordinary scrubby thing that can be found so if he's a consuming fire why didn't you consume the bush and I don't know that there's any single authoritative answer some commentators have likened the burning bush to the
57:32 -  plight of Israel the people that have suffered historically affliction but have not been obliterated they yet remain and God was saying something to Moses about the call to the nation that he's still the God of this nation in the
57:49 -  midst of them that though they're burning in the affliction of their judgments yet they do not expire that that and I'm sure that that's part but there may be more so at this point tell you what I'm going to do
58:05 -  we're going to have a good
