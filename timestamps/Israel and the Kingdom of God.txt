Israel and the Kingdom of God

00:00 -  I think that we can understand more and more why Paul asked that, pray for me that utterance might be given. It was not the issue of his competence or his ability.
00:21 -  It was beyond him, able though he was. And that's why Paul's most frequent cry was, who is sufficient for these things?
00:46 -  Have you cried that? Until we have cried that, we are outside the faith. When the faith is something that we can perform, we are already apostate.
01:15 -  What I want to introduce this morning, is the theocratic setting for the subject of Israel. Is this a word with which you are familiar?
01:40 -  The theocratic kingdom. It's totally absent from the consciousness of the Church. And needs to be restored.
02:00 -  We speak about the coming of the Lord, but in terms of our personal escape, and not in terms of his coming as King.
02:22 -  Let's be ruthlessly honest this morning. Are you actually expecting a kingdom to come? See, the word kingdom itself, at least in my country, has become an abstraction.
02:52 -  The kingdom of God is within you. We think of it as a mode of being, rather than an actual rule.
03:12 -  So I want to speak about the subject of Israel in terms of an actual theocratic rule. The Church has lost all expectancy for this, to the exact degree that it has no expectancy for Israel's millennial destiny.
03:36 -  These two things are inextricably bound together. The first is that the Church has lost all expectancy for Israel's millennial destiny. Because these two things are inextricably bound together.
04:18 -  When the Church joined its triumphalist mentality with Constantine, they saw the kingdom as already come. Rome was its center.
04:35 -  Not Jerusalem. So therefore every reference to Jerusalem and Zion in the prophetic scriptures was spiritualized away.
04:53 -  It was made a metaphor for the Church. After all, Israel was finished. God has rejected the nation.
05:11 -  For it has rejected its messiah. And the Church is now the center. And the Church has rejected its messiah.
05:22 -  And the Church is now the Israel of God. And this kingdom has come. In a holy Roman Empire.
05:38 -  The reformation did not correct this error. And we are still living with the consequence of an incomplete reformation. That's why my ministry is the ministry of restoration.
06:00 -  It is the prophetic task of restoring what has been lost. It is the prophetic task of restoring what has been lost. And this is absolutely central for your consideration.
06:24 -  It's the issue of the scriptures themselves. To restore a lost hermeneutical principle. To restore this lost principle.
06:43 -  The literal reading of the Word of God. For example, Isaiah chapter 2. That the mountain of the Lord shall be above all the hills and the mountains.
07:05 -  For it says that the law shall go forth out of Zion and the Word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. That this would be the seat or the location of God's theocratic rule. How do you like that?
07:38 -  Would you have preferred Moscow? Or Geneva? Or New York City?
07:47 -  Any one of these is a far more prestigious location for world rule than Zion. But we're back to yesterday's subject. The conflict of wisdoms.
08:07 -  Two moral systems in opposition. The wisdom of this world. The wisdom of this world.
08:26 -  From the prince of this world. And the Gods of this world. That celebrate power.
08:45 -  The authority of man. Prestige. Wealth.
08:54 -  Lust. Ambition. And visible power.
09:03 -  That will in the last alternative use violence and force to achieve its ends. This is the world system. And the world's wisdom.
09:26 -  By whatever name it employs. Fascism. Communism.
09:38 -  Even democracy. Is a more veiled... A more veiled deception of this naked truth and power.
09:53 -  What we should be looking for is the rule of God. His kingdom come. In a very literal way.
10:08 -  Over the nations. From his world capital. Over the nations.
10:18 -  Over the nations. From his world capital. The holy hill of Zion.
10:29 -  In the city of Jerusalem. This is the heart of scandal and offense. It is the scandal of particularity.
10:51 -  That God would be that specific. After all, as some hot shots say, God's not interested in real estate. His kingdom is universal.
11:15 -  He's not concerned for the land of Israel. He's not interested in geography. That's the conceit about which Paul warns in Romans 11.
11:38 -  What does Psalm 2 tell us? That the heathen rage and imagine a vain thing. They devise a vain thing in verse 1.
11:57 -  The heathen or the nations rage are in an uproar. And they devise a vain thing. The kings of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed.
12:23 -  Notice kings and rulers. This is not a synonym of one for the other. The kings are the earthly authorities.
12:42 -  But the rulers are the invisible principalities and powers of the air who express their influence through earthly rulers. And the prince, this word, it means these princes, these heavenly evils who carry out their ideas through earthly rulers. And both are opposed to the rule of God and of his anointed.
13:13 -  What does Christ mean? The anointed one anointed to rule. When the first angelic pronouncement was made in the Gospel of Luke.
13:36 -  And it's always important to look at the first pronouncement. The first expression. And this is an angelic pronouncement.
13:56 -  You can't find anything more pure than that. Nor more authoritative. What does the angel say to Mary?
14:10 -  What does the angel say to Mary? In chapter 1 verse 31 you shall call his name Jesus. Verse 32.
14:27 -  He will be great and will be called the son of the most high. Luke 132. He will be great and will be called the son of the most high.
14:42 -  And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. And his kingdom will have no end.
15:00 -  When have you considered that last? That Jesus came to rule. And over his cross in three languages to mock him.
15:21 -  Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews. But if he's King of the Jews, he's King of all nations. For his kingdom shall have no end.
15:46 -  The prophet Isaiah says the same thing in chapter 9. About unto us a child will be born and unto us a son is given in verse 6. What's the next statement?
16:07 -  And the government shall be upon his shoulders. Oh dear kinder, dear children. You must understand this.
16:25 -  Or you will be absolutely bewildered by the anti-Semitic fury that comes upon Jews. For the devil has always sought their annihilation.
16:47 -  Because this kingdom must first come to them. And must be established in their city. Upon the throne of David.
17:01 -  To order it and to establish it. That's how specific God is. That's what it says here.
17:18 -  The government will rest upon his shoulders. And his name will be called Wonderful Council of the Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
17:37 -  And just as the angel said to Mary. There will be no end to the increase of his government or of his peace. On the throne of David.
17:55 -  That's why the heathen rage and imagine a vain thing. They would rather have it in Rome. Or Geneva.
18:10 -  Or New York. But not with this despised nation. Or in their capital city.
18:25 -  Or in the hill of Zion. But what does God say in Psalm 2? He holds the nations in contempt.
18:44 -  For he has set his king upon the holy hill of Zion. Now if you were the prince of this world. And did not want to give up your influence over the nations.
19:12 -  And know that God has his own theocratic intentions. That must be in keeping with the scriptures. That the Lord can only go forth out from Zion.
19:32 -  And the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. That requires therefore a restored nation to that place. That requires therefore a restored nation to that place.
19:47 -  Who are already submitted to the government of their king. Because he has the credentials. He is the son of David.
20:00 -  And therefore qualified to sit on David's throne. What would you do to avoid this loss of power? You would annihilate or eradicate the nation.
20:24 -  Whose restoration is required. Whose restoration is required. Before their king can establish his dwelling place and sanctuary in this city.
20:44 -  And this explains the demonic fury against the Jews. And this explains the demonic fury against the Jews. Moving through unregenerate men.
21:03 -  Quick to grab any simplistic explanation for the breakdown of economy and government in the last days. And blame it on the Jews. For which there is sufficient evidence or sufficient truth to support their lie.
21:34 -  For which there is sufficient evidence or sufficient truth to support their lie. But however much we can explain this sociologically. The root of it is demonic.
21:57 -  It's a fury unto death. To annihilate a people. And by so doing frustrate God's plan.
22:10 -  For the establishment of his rule. Upon their throne. In their Zion.
22:19 -  In their Jerusalem. As a restored nation. Are you following me so far?
22:30 -  Acts chapter 3 verse 21. Where is the king today? Contained in the heavens.
22:59 -  Until the time of all that God said to the lips of all the saints and prophets of the ages. I'll tell you what it says in English. That the Lord himself is contained or held up in the heavens.
23:22 -  He has imposed this restriction upon himself. Waiting for the fulfillment of a certain condition. The restoration of all things spoken by the prophets.
23:43 -  Since the world began. And when you will examine the prophets. What is their one great theme?
24:00 -  The restoration of the nation back to God. In the last days. Despite thousands of years of apostasy and alienation.
24:23 -  This is the great drama of the end. This is what concludes history. And the king is contained until it happens.
24:43 -  He said you will not see me until you will say again blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. He said you will not see me until you will say again blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Whether we like it or not.
25:00 -  We have to bow before the divine plan of God. And his wisdom. Which is different than the wisdom of the world.
25:11 -  Because he chooses the least thing. The weakest thing. The despised thing.
25:22 -  Israel. And the hill of Zion. To be the location of the center of his kingdom and his authority over the nations.
25:38 -  Can you say amen to that? Can you say hallelujah to that? Do you rejoice for that?
25:52 -  Why should Israel be so. Sent it so. Chosen by God.
26:04 -  They don't deserve it. They have blasphemed his name in every nation to which they've been driven. They're not qualified.
26:20 -  The way we are. But he will choose whom he will choose. And he will elect whom he will elect.
26:38 -  Because he is I am who I am. And will be who I will be. So as we say in America to the world.
26:50 -  Eat your heart out. Be frustrated in your rage. This is our God.
27:06 -  This is our God. The God of Jacob. And this is what he has chosen.
27:14 -  He has made promise to this people. That he is set upon your throne. From the lineage of David.
27:25 -  Will come your king. And he will rule forever. This isn't a little temporary innovation.
27:44 -  Once it's established it is fixed and eternal. It is his millennial reign. It doesn't end after a thousand years.
28:06 -  The devil is allowed out of his captivity for a momentary release. In which he stirs up the nations one last time against God and against Israel. Chapter 38 of Ezekiel, God and Magog.
28:40 -  But the Lord judges those nations. And the evil one is cast into the lake of fire forever. And God's rule continues forever.
28:58 -  Over all nations. For the law will go forth out of Zion. And the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
29:09 -  Now brother, how do you know whether that's literal or poetic and spiritual? Because it says that the nations will study war no more. And beat their swords into plowshares.
29:38 -  And their spears into pruning hooks. The nations will be affected. Radically.
29:54 -  Because God is ruling from the holy hill of Zion. How does all this happen? When Israel is today presently in her apostate condition.
30:16 -  And knows nothing about this. And just can't know. Only wants to succeed politically.
30:29 -  All of this happens because of the church. The church is God's exclusive instrument and agent for the fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophets. Or it will not be fulfilled.
31:02 -  This is your mandate. This is the wisdom of God. This is what Paul saw in Romans 9-11.
31:19 -  How else do you explain Paul's conclusion in Romans 11? Have you read it lately? Romans 11, 33-36.
31:50 -  For of him, the last verse, 36, for of him and through him and to him are all things. And now you can read the last statement together with me. To whom be glory forever.
32:19 -  Forever! It's glory forever! The church that does not see this mystery. And makes this mystery central to its own being and existence.
32:44 -  Is not the church. The issue of Israel is the issue of the church. Not because we have a romantic affinity for the Jew.
33:03 -  Though we certainly should respect them. They are still the chosen people. And it's not the question of qualification.
33:17 -  We need to bless what God has blessed. And to choose what he has chosen. Because it's the issue of his glory forever.
33:34 -  This is of him. I didn't make it up. Because I'm Jewish.
33:43 -  And I want to see my people have a place of preference. This is of him. The God who chooses stables.
33:57 -  And is crucified outside the city. Nakedly. The God who is despised and rejected of men.
34:12 -  Chooses the hill of Zion. And the despised people. Because his way is not our way.
34:24 -  Nor are our thoughts his thoughts. He has another wisdom. Or we ourselves would not be saved.
34:38 -  He chooses the foolish and the weak thing. To confound the wise and the mighty. That's why he has chosen Israel.
34:56 -  And that's why he has chosen us. It's another wisdom. Now here is what we are going to see in the last days.
35:12 -  Let's see what we are going to see in the last days. Israel is brought to a national death. Both within its present political boundaries.
35:32 -  And wherever the nation is dispersed in the world. The prophets speak of a time of Jacob's trouble. It's already happening.
35:46 -  And getting worse every day. In every nation. Including my own.
35:58 -  Skinheads. Skinheads. The neo-Nazis.
36:08 -  Neo-Nazis. Threatening phone calls. Burned synagogues.
36:24 -  You watch this. You watch this. It's going to increase daily.
36:34 -  And your own country will not be exempt. You already have a juicy history in this regard. Ukrainian antisemitism is famous.
36:50 -  And how much would it take to stir it up again? There will not be a Jew that survives this. Except for the church.
37:10 -  That has mercy on them that they might receive mercy. When such an act of mercy will threaten your own security and life. Is your heart going out for me?
37:38 -  You see the unhappy task that we prophets have? We have to speak in advance of the time. When there's not much evidence to support such a view.
37:56 -  With the absolute assurance that it will come. And when it comes, will it find you prepared? To extend mercy.
38:12 -  That they might obtain mercy. Even if it will threaten your own life. Who are the overcomers of the last days?
38:26 -  Those who overcome by the blood of the Lamb? The word of their testimony? And love not their life unto the death?
38:38 -  Okay, so to be identified with Jews means I might lose my life? Praise the Lord. That loss is eternal gain.
38:54 -  It obtains from me a crown. That shall not fade away. That is eternal.
39:04 -  That's what I'm going to be speaking later in the other room. The restoration of eternity. And the eternal mindedness.
39:20 -  Which is the heart of the whole apostolic view. The heart of the whole apostolic view. God is sinking deep shafts into the foundation of your church.
39:48 -  Or it will not be the church. It will be something less. Something other.
39:58 -  It will conduct services. People will enjoy them. You'll have programs.
40:08 -  But you will not be an actor in the apostolic drama. And you will forfeit your eternal reward for it. And might even be found opposing it.
40:30 -  And might even be found opposing it. Because there's going to be only two classes of men at the end. One smaller, one larger.
40:48 -  That which is apostolic. And that which is apostate. And the one will persecute the other.
41:00 -  And the one will persecute the other. It's not the world that we need to fear so much. But those who will kill us and claim they are doing God a service.
41:16 -  But those who will kill us and claim they are doing God a service. It's not the world that we need to fear so much. But those who will kill us and claim they are doing God a service.
41:28 -  The issue of the Jew will identify who the true church is. This issue of the Jew will identify who the true church is. One remnant will find the other.
41:44 -  One remnant will find the other. The remnant of Israel will find you. In the midst of their last days' trial and extremity.
42:06 -  They will return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord. They will return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord. Though they did not leave it in that condition.
42:18 -  Though they did not leave it in that condition. It says in Isaiah 35. Mourning and sighing shall flee away.
42:32 -  Mourning, sadness, sorrow. And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads.
42:46 -  For they return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord. For they return to Zion as the redeemed of the Lord. They were uprooted out of their cities.
43:02 -  And compelled to flee for their lives. And compelled to flee for their lives. But a place of refuge was prepared for them.
43:16 -  But a place of refuge was prepared for them. Where God met with them. Face to face.
43:28 -  And brought them into the bond of his covenant. And brought them into the bond of his covenant. And the rod of his authority.
43:38 -  Ezekiel chapter 20. Verse 33 to the end. Something happens to them
43:52 -  in the midst of their crisis. Something happens to them in the midst of their crisis. They meet God face to face.
44:02 -  How can he be in so many places at the same time? How can he be in so many places at the same time? Through the church in the nations.
44:16 -  Who show forth his face. Who show forth his faith. And not the grim face of religious responsibility.
44:30 -  Obligation. I guess I have to. It's the people who want to.
44:42 -  And counted a privilege. To participate in this final drama. And have a face that show forth the Lord.
44:54 -  And have a face that show forth the Lord. That's why I'm here today. That's why I'm alive today.
45:06 -  That's why I didn't die 30 years ago in my own crisis. That's why I didn't die 30 years ago in my own crisis. Because I met a face
45:16 -  of a young gentile girl. Half my age. With whom I should have had nothing to do.
45:30 -  A Protestant. In whose face I saw that lightens the gentiles.
45:44 -  And it is the glory of Israel. There's no witness more powerful than his glory
45:58 -  through the light that has come to the gentiles. Who are walking in the light as he is in the light.
46:10 -  The church that is the ground and pillar of truth. That is not hiding. That does not hide itself.
46:24 -  That is not living a double life. The church that is open to one another. That speaks the truth in love.
46:36 -  That exhorts and rebukes. That's the church. That is the key to Israel's restoration.
46:52 -  Whose restoration is the key to the Lord's release. And the coming of his kingdom. Forever.
47:06 -  What chapter in the prophets most accurately describes the death, the national death
47:14 -  to which the nation of Israel is now presently moving? Who is the bright student here?
47:36 -  That can answer that question. Which prophet? Daniel does speak of the last days
47:46 -  of Apocalypse. But I'm thinking of Ezekiel. Chapter 37.
48:00 -  Where the great national cry is made. In verse 11. We are cut off.
48:12 -  We are without hope. We are as dry bones. We are as dry bones.
48:22 -  It's a statement that the nation has never yet made. Even with the Holocaust.
48:30 -  It points to a future condition. And the moment that God hears it, He does not Himself speak to the dry bones.
48:48 -  But He commands the Son of Man to prophesy that those bones may live.
49:00 -  You are that Son of Man. You are that prophetic company that can be commanded to prophesy
49:20 -  and whose word constitutes an event. Not just a hopeful wish. It's a corporate word.
49:34 -  Rebellence with the power and the authority of God. Sufficient to raise the dead.
49:52 -  But brother, we're not yet in that condition. Exactly. That's why God is now speaking
50:04 -  that you would consciously and willfully move to that condition. From faith to faith
50:18 -  and glory to glory. So, our time is up. And I want to pray for that.
50:28 -  Don't be fearful if you didn't understand everything. It's on tape.
50:36 -  But it's a word of spirit and of life. It is itself
50:44 -  a prophetic proclamation. That will establish the event even if you yourself are dead
50:56 -  and in your own grave. For of Him and through Him and to Him
51:08 -  are all things including this morning to whom be glory forever.
51:20 -  Lord, let it be. Encourage the faith of these children
51:28 -  that this word to them this morning was not just instruction
51:36 -  but prophetic event itself. Establish this word
51:46 -  to the eternal praise to the glory and the salvation
51:54 -  of Israel's remnant and your coming as King.
52:04 -  And we thank you and give you the praise for our privilege to participate with you in it.
52:14 -  In Jesus' name. Amen.
