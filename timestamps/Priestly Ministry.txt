Priestly Ministry

00:00 -  Well, I think that the first statement that I have to make is this. All ministry is first and foremost unto the Lord. Amen.
00:12 -  Sounds like such a simple, true statement, doesn't it? So self-evident. You think we would have known it long ago.
00:22 -  And probably though we have spoken that and acknowledged it, it has not been so. All ministry, first of all, foremost to the Lord. This really is a man-pleasing generation.
00:41 -  Have you realized that? The Lord has really been teaching me some things of late. I mentioned in an episode already in a few days that I've been here, but I want to repeat now,
00:52 -  because I've not yet recovered from it. It was so startling, a revelation. It was hearing another man preach.
01:02 -  Something I don't ordinarily have the privilege of doing. And going with anticipation because his reputation had already preceded him. Spirit-filled minister, working in a denominational church.
01:17 -  I went on day three Sunday morning and sat in the balcony of this rather large, prestigious church. And as is my practice, I always look at the faces. What did God say to the prophet in Israel?
01:37 -  Your confidence does testify against you. And I'll tell you that that was enough in itself. What a study.
01:47 -  Why? How can anybody be preoccupied with birds so long as there are faces? I saw all the state and proper religionists in their places.
02:01 -  Husbands and wives sitting side by side. But I'll tell you that the gap that was really between them was immeasurable. They were like sticks of wood.
02:13 -  The whole spirit that surrounded these couples was the spirit of compromise. It was making the best of a bad thing. It was sharing modern conveniences together.
02:25 -  It was anything but the mystery, the model, and the wonder of marriage. They were putting in their hour. And back on the back pew were their teenage kids.
02:35 -  What a motley collection. Long hair, creepy face, body jewelry, chokers around their necks, hip hugging, mottled clothes, wholly and entirely and completely out of it.
02:53 -  I really can't blame the poor kids who were chucking each other on the chin and digging each other with their elbows and trying to get a few good laughs out of the weary proceeding. The whole thing was so fantastically ceremonial.
03:08 -  Hey listen, you don't have to go to Timbuktu and Borneo and places like that to see paganism or idolatry or primitive religion. Just fasten your attention on any local Presbyterian Baptist Pentecostal church around and you'll have plenty.
03:28 -  It's amazing how we're able to tolerate. Maybe that's what makes us Jews so peculiar. We have a very short span of power.
03:39 -  And if no one else is going to shriek and cry out, by God, we will. I told my mother Paul that I've already come within inches of pulling microphones out of the hands of most celebrated speakers. At great full-Gospel carnivals.
03:57 -  And who knows, I'm just becoming increasingly maniacal as we come closer to the end of the age. Less and less tolerant. Does that mean is that just a contiguous Jewish personality? Or is it a very earnest God whose patience is growed short?
04:14 -  Now here's the whole catch, children. The outstanding phenomenon was this. That a man was speaking the right-arm message.
04:24 -  I don't think there's one of us that could ever have faulted it. It was perfectly scripted. Perfectly doctrinal.
04:30 -  Perfectly alive. You say, how can those things be? Are you yet that much?
04:38 -  Are you yet that instructed? Are you yet that easily persuaded if someone speaks something doctrinally and scripturally correct? That you think it's alright and right-arm?
04:49 -  Are you persuaded when someone says, don't look at me, look at God, it's not me, it's God? That they're exulting God? You think because someone says, give the glory to God, they're giving the glory to God?
05:03 -  You think because we use cheap trite phrases about, well at least he loves the Lord, but he really loves the Lord? Hey fellas, we come. Our God is eminently the God of reality and truth.
05:17 -  And there's a world freaking out and dying for the very absence of that reality. Not only do I have a short tolerance ban, I have a very slow recovery. I've not recovered from that ungainly experience.
05:34 -  I'm hearing a man say the right things and his spirit contradicting it all the way. You know what the spirit is saying? Hey, don't take me seriously, don't get flustered.
05:42 -  Don't worry, this is just a sermon. No one intends that you're going to act on it. Keep you cool.
05:50 -  Let's go on with this ceremonial nonsense after all. My income and my security and will being depends upon it. I don't push you, you don't push me. Right? Right.
06:00 -  We'll go on until the end of the hour and we'll be there next Sunday for more of this thing. I had another experience in recent weeks. Invited to a TV interview on a Christian station.
06:12 -  It came during a series of meetings that were absolutely horrendous. Painful, excruciating, difficult. And God wasn't explaining to me day by day what was going on.
06:29 -  I only heard pouring out of my mouth the most untoward statements, absolutely freaky. It was either the ravings of some kind of quasi-lunatic or it was God. And everybody who was persuaded was a lunatic, including the pastor.
06:51 -  Who called me to his office the night before to say, in all my 30 years of mystery I've not had such a speaker. What are you trying to do? Rack the church.
07:00 -  My children have not come back from the first time that you began here. My elders and deacons had been walking out. You've outraged people.
07:11 -  I went. Left another one of those messages. I was taken late at night for an hour's drive down the freeway
07:23 -  to this Christian television studio to be interviewed. And I came in and there were the little Dresden dolls before the camera. The husband and wife of this program it was and whose station they managed.
07:37 -  Really pretty. Pastel blue suit and white shoes with tassels. Real dolly with carefully cultivated sideburns.
07:47 -  The wife with a silver wig and about eyelashes an inch and a half long and makeup about two inches thick. I could have supposed have endured that.
07:58 -  But what I could not endure was the squealing voices and the faint excitement and the reports that have come in. And all of the other marked stuff that seemed to give the appearance
08:13 -  of the excitement that comes with being the believer. But it was phony baloney. You know how I know?
08:20 -  The moment that the camera turned off them to something else, they sang and it turned gray. And the moment that the camera turned off,
08:29 -  hello there, have you been waiting for me? Well they had been promoting Israel to us and they figured that they had a stiff that they could use.
08:41 -  Our cat is Jewish and I understand he was saved in Jerusalem. Where are the cats? Isn't it exciting what's going on in Israel?
08:51 -  Oh, well isn't it? You know people at the whole thing are staged. It was a put up job in which a man was required to condescend
09:05 -  to the forms that were arranged to be a patsy to promote the interests of men. And I couldn't do it. I didn't last very long.
09:17 -  I think as quickly as they could. They got me off the program and out of sight and out of sound. I was such a painful contrast to their pert, glib, unctuous, happy community.
09:32 -  Wrinkled, crumpled, deflated, weary, blah. I could hardly sleep that night on the basis of that very brief experience. I thought to myself, in that community of about 500,000 Jews,
09:52 -  what would happen if some family of my kinsmen would inadvertently turn the dial to that station and see these little porcelain mugs with their little giddy stuff and shrill shrieks.
10:07 -  I'll tell you, if there's anything good left in them as Jews, they'll just as quickly turn them off. I'll tell you children, there's a cry of God that's going forth over the earth.
10:18 -  And it's a cry for reality. It's a cry for truth. It's a cry for setting forth the glory of God
10:25 -  that doesn't need pancake makeup and artificial eyelashes and all kinds of pert little squeals and glib, unctuous kinds of behavior to testify that there's a living God.
10:39 -  Well, I'm speaking like a fool. And I want you to turn to me the book of Leviticus to give you a complete contrast which I think you desperately need.
11:01 -  The kind of chapter or section of scripture which in times past I would have read cowardly in a sense of obligation and quickly passed on to more exciting texts.
11:13 -  I would have considered this, in the Brooklyn lexicon, a drag. You know, some kind of esoteric stuff about priests and what they wore and what they had to do and then they did this and they did that
11:29 -  and they killed this and they killed that, they sprinkled this and that and whew, what? They've come to some weird, some chronicle of details wholly unrelated
11:39 -  to our mother life. That's when I was younger than faith. You know what I say now?
11:45 -  I can't think of anything more relevant, powerful, filled with enormous significance for our lives now at the end of the age than what has seemed to us boring and needless detail.
12:00 -  I'm going to read this or skip through it as the Lord will lead with this apology that I'm not a teacher. You're not going to get one of those teaching presentations
12:11 -  where everything is explained, what the road means, what that means. I don't know myself. All I know is this.
12:18 -  I am powerfully drawn to everything that is stated in this chapter. It's a mystery children, I can't explain it. And that's why it was so important for me to preserve the move
12:31 -  that God has put me in. And as the brother said to me on my way into the building tonight where he sees my newsletter, he said,
12:37 -  aren't there so much between the lines? There has to be because I only send it out four times a year. Leviticus the 8th chapter.
12:47 -  You're going to have to read between the lines tonight by the Spirit of God. But I love a chapter that I'm reading from the Amplified Edition
12:58 -  that begins, and the Lord said. Hallelujah, you like that beginning over here? It thrills my soul, and the Lord said.
13:07 -  There's a distinct contrast between the things that the Lord says and the things that men say. The Lord said to Moses, take Aaron and his sons with him
13:17 -  and their garments and the anointing oil and the bowl of the offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread and assemble all the congregation at the door of the tent of the meeting.
13:27 -  Moses did as the Lord commanded him. And the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of the meeting. Are you salivating already?
13:37 -  That means drooling, I am. Only for two reasons. Because the Lord said, and the man did it.
13:45 -  He didn't need any gifts, hands, blood, wives, or house. He didn't need any explanations, any justification, any rationalization. He did it because the Lord commanded him.
13:57 -  And I think that when we get finished with this chapter, you know what we're going to note? That everything that the Lord commanded was absolutely inimical.
14:05 -  You know when I took this little fancy little camera, didn't you? I was walking amplified myself. He chose everything that was opposed to human sensibility.
14:15 -  He went out of his way, it seems, to find everything that would contradict intelligence, right reckoning, human sensibility, and good taste. And I love that kind of regard.
14:31 -  I think somewhere it says in the Gospel of Luke that that which is esteemed of men is an abomination of his own. And I suppose we can say that the devil's side of the coin is this.
14:42 -  That which is abomination inside of men is esteemed of God. Oh, children, are you seeing as God sees? You have His discernment.
14:55 -  You love the spirit of God versus the spirit of truth. Because truth is nothing more and nothing less than everything as God sees it. Would to God that there'd be such a power out of my mouth tonight
15:09 -  to blast us out of this orbit, out of the world, out of conventional associations and modes of speaking and thinking and seeing the being. I didn't even want to look up, I didn't want to see it tonight.
15:21 -  I hope you understand what I'm saying. You're beautiful. But I didn't want to be influenced by any kind of human factor
15:27 -  or any kind of expectation. Would to God I could have worn polka's over my eyes and just been completely God's fool.
15:34 -  But in a dimension that's beyond North Carolina, the United States, 1976, and come to that place where God is as timeless, eternal, global, universal, where truth is. That's what I think he wants to do this evening.
15:51 -  Hallelujah. I think we need to be brought back to these ancient scriptures to find that God and that truth again.
16:01 -  The Lord said to assemble all the congregation in the middle of the tentative evening. And Moses did as the Lord came with him. The congregation assembled.
16:09 -  And they were going to be assembled to watch the foolish practices which Moses was going to perform with Aaron and with his sons. You say, why do you think that that was necessary?
16:19 -  I can only give you a guess. I think it's for this reason. That somewhere it says, as the priests, so the people.
16:29 -  The people need to see what is required of the priests. And for God's sake, would you become disabused of the notion that somehow you're the lay people and we are the professionals?
16:41 -  This is just our cast, fellas. Brooklyn boy makes good. No Bible school, no seminary, no nothing.
16:50 -  Drafted, pressed into service. This fool. Bleeding and sweating and agonizing just like you.
16:58 -  I don't know how many other leaders have this illusion to learn that I have foul movements just like everybody else. But that men like me have problems.
17:08 -  And that dear marriages can be struggles also. I think that the congregation needs to be assembled at the tent. To throw the tent again and witness all that pertains to the priests.
17:24 -  Because as the priests go, so also the people. Moses told the congregation, this is what the Lord has commanded to be done.
17:35 -  Moses brought air in his sons and washed them with water. He put on air in the long under tunic, girded him with the long sash, clothed him with the rope,
17:43 -  put the ephod and upper vestments upon him, and girded him with the spiritually woven cords attached to the ephod, binding it to him.
17:51 -  Moses put upon air in the breastplate, the breastplate, the berm, and the tomb. And put the turban or miter on his head.
17:59 -  And on it, in front, Moses put the shining bowl, like the Holy Bible, as the Lord commanded him. What a bunch of foolishness.
18:07 -  How would you like to be washed as a grown man in the public sight of us? I just feel like closing my mouth.
18:15 -  You guys are so distracted because then come up the platform or someone comes into the room and gets dirty. This is Holy Children.
18:28 -  We're still almost like a kindergarten, distracted and curious. It began with the washing of priests with water.
18:40 -  I think that's where it necessarily always must begin. The washing of the water of the Lord. May God ever keep us from becoming so slick,
18:52 -  so expert that when we're called upon, we leap out of our seats quickly and come to the microphone for fear that there's a moment's pause or a silence somehow
19:01 -  that the interest of God's people is going to become distractive or restless. Haven't you seen those carnivals? Like a three-ringed shelf, first this one and then that one.
19:09 -  Now this one, now pray, now the speaker. Now they open up. So what's the matter if a man stumbles?
19:15 -  What's the matter if there are lengthy silences and pauses and gropings and trillings and slogans? What's the matter if a man agonizes his way through the message?
19:24 -  It's not some good professional who's just knocking it off. You want to know something, children? Every time a man comes to this holy place,
19:33 -  it's a matter of life or death. Have you realized that yet? You think this is some meeting time?
19:41 -  You think you're coming to hear a personality? Or we're for an evening's entertainment? Or wasn't it an interesting message?
19:48 -  I tell you with all my heart that the hour is so short that every single coming together of God's people in this name or this service is a matter of life and death.
20:00 -  And who is sufficient for that? No quick glib easy business, this priesthood. No quick crash program, three months of discipleship teaching at a desk
20:14 -  and then you're sent off to Afghanistan. No injuries intended. This was a God who took 30 years to prepare a priest
20:24 -  for only three years in service. You want to know about these priests? They didn't begin for their 30th year.
20:31 -  Hey man, that's wasteful. I'm 21 and I'm filled with a wine of life and rip roaring, ready to go, let me out.
20:39 -  God says, cool it. You're wet behind the ears, not notes. Where do you think you're going?
20:46 -  You're full out of the wine of life, but your own fleshly ambition seems to be earned. You'll be tempted in my hand and I'll release you when you're 30.
20:57 -  And when you're 50, you'll be required to face compulsory retirement. But 50, hey boy, I'm 47 and I'm in the greatest shape of my life. Only three years more than I was thinking of.
21:10 -  70, 75 and white and 40 with age and full of wisdom. You know children, the priesthood in God's book is extravagant, lavish, and wasteful.
21:24 -  It begins late and it ends early, but all for those 20 years of perfect service unto the Lord. The spirit of this age was entirely something else.
21:36 -  Easy come, easy go. Man, what, if it's 86 months and you don't have a ministry yet, and you play a mean guitar, you ought to be going someplace.
21:48 -  I think the amplifiers have replaced the school of the priesthood. If you've got enough electronic equipment and enough dash and bravado, man, you ought to have a ministry somewhere.
22:03 -  You're going to see something shortly when the glory of God falls. And it's because we've had no appetite for glory, no desire to see it,
22:13 -  we have been content with something much less than we have something much less. But God is returning us children to Biblical standards and truths.
22:23 -  He's going to have a holy, royal priesthood, long in preparation. Men whose service is unto the Lord and not as man-pleaseless,
22:35 -  speaking correct things with unctuous tones that say, don't take me seriously, don't get right. It's only a ceremony.
22:44 -  He's going to have men who will do all that the Lord has commanded. Nothing more and nothing less. Amen.
22:55 -  It begins with the washing of a wonderful word, first for the priest, publicly and humiliatingly as grown men before the entire congregation. And then putting on these garments of white linen,
23:10 -  the linen of God's righteousness reaches to cover their nakedness. From their loins unto their thighs shall they reach. My children, the anointing oil that's going to be put upon these priests
23:21 -  cannot come upon flesh. No wonder we have been desperately striving for every alternative to the anointing oil of God.
23:30 -  Turn up the amplifier a little more, will you? Let's have a little more zip, a little bit more performance, a little bit more feigned charisma,
23:40 -  a little bit more technique and manipulation. Maybe it will seem the same as that which comes from the authentic anointing of God. If you want to know why we have substituted the amplifiers for the anointing,
23:55 -  it's because our flesh has not been covered in the white linen of His righteousness. Oh, authentic God was fastidious about this, and so when that high priest ascended into the holy place,
24:07 -  he didn't even dare go up by steps. But on a ramp, less than the going of steps, he had to lift his foot so high that the flesh of his body would be revealed.
24:18 -  My God was upon flesh as of hearts. No flesh shall stand in His presence. No flesh shall compete with His glory,
24:28 -  and His anointing oil shall come upon no flesh. It shall pour down upon the head of Aaron, upon down his beard, and down to the head of his garment.
24:37 -  And there's only one place where that flesh is revealed. It's the head of the body then and now. But as far as the body is concerned,
24:47 -  from the neck to the toes, covered in the white linen of the righteousness of God. No ambition, no fleshly cravings to be seen,
24:56 -  ministries to be promoted, works, names, nothing. If we want, we'll hold it in our hands. I'll tell you dear children, if you might have it, forget it.
25:09 -  If you think that you're going to go through slaughter and sacrifice, and blood and gore from fingernails to elbow, to invoke the glory of God in the only way that it can be evoked,
25:19 -  by bloody sacrifice, without the anointing of God, you're not going to be a priest, you'll just be a butcher hacking at meat.
25:28 -  No service can be performed independent of the holy anointing oil, and there shall be no holy anointing oil, except the priest be covered in the linen of the righteousness of God.
25:40 -  A long undertoneck, a long sash clothed him with the robe, the ephod of the vestment girded, and skillfully woven cords attached to the ephod, binding it to him.
25:56 -  I like that. I like that the garment of the priesthood is bound to the priest. Not some quick blip, easy, put on a take off.
26:05 -  No stepping into a phone booth and dropping your jacket and coming out like Superman. The priestly garment is bound to the man. No guys waiting in timespan when we were hot chats at the pulpit,
26:18 -  and something less at home with our wives and our kids. Take on, take off. One thing publicly, another thing privately.
26:25 -  You know what we've got to say? One thing, period. You're a priest publicly and you're a priest privately.
26:33 -  His garment is vulnerable to your body with cords of glue. It's the heavenly color and it's righteousness. It's not some two-faced thing that's got to do with public performance and private discipline.
26:48 -  I speak from a high school, but I praise God that he's the one for me. He's weak in times past, but he's calling us back to this. On top of the turban that was on the head of the priest was put a gold plate.
27:04 -  You know what it said? Holiness unto the Lord. Holiness unto the Lord.
27:11 -  And you can turn to a thousand of Weston's dictionaries or the one of your own choice. You'll never get a definition of the word Lord. Have you learned that already?
27:21 -  The great words are just not susceptible to dictionary definition. And there's only one way we'll ever learn it, what Holiness really means. And that's by the intimacy of the knowledge of him and the fellowship of his service.
27:36 -  You're willing to learn it there, you priests. You're not going to get it at the desk of the dictionary. You're going to get it where Joseph got it, in pits of isolation and rejection,
27:48 -  even from your own brethren, who despise you for your dreams and all the more for the words you speak. You're going to get it where you're falsely accused and find yourself again thrown into the stinking dungeons. How else should a man have said to a woman so disillusive,
28:07 -  how could I do this evil thing and grieve God? How did he know it was evil when the Ten Commandments had not yet even been spoken? He didn't need commandments, children.
28:23 -  He knew that God was holy because he knew him in the place of fellowship, the places of alienation, isolation and rejection. I have a feeling it's the only place to know the fellowship of his service.
28:39 -  Oh, may God give us again such a priesthood, who have on their heads such a sense of the holiness of God, such a sense of solemn responsibility in opening the mouth before God's people,
28:58 -  such a sense that they must never condescend to being professional or glib or expert, but fear that they might be disappointed in men if they wait on God agonizingly until they should bring his purpose. Oh, I'll tell you some strange things that happened in my life.
29:16 -  You think this is something tonight? How would you like to have been with me that night? In a situation where a charismatic fellowship had just built themselves a new church, gone into death, built themselves to be a crossword in their history,
29:31 -  and they invited me to address them for three successive nights, thinking that I was an oracle of God. Well, I thought so too, or else I would not have come. And I came with expectancy and with peace, knowing that their need was great.
29:49 -  I remember going down to my face in that motel room that night, the night of the first meeting and crying out to God, Lord, what is on your heart for this people? Breathe to me your theme for these days. Trigger that portion of scripture from which you had me to speak this night.
30:07 -  You know what he said? Nothing. Silence. Deadening. Deafening. Silence. Well, at least that is how I'll look at it.
30:20 -  I remember driving in the car to the meeting that night, whistling as I went, and praying on my rent, okay, what I said. And the way that it so often pleases you to do, while I'm in this car now, Jesus, by the wafting of your spirit, can talk to me, your theme.
30:35 -  But nothing. Well, there was still time. I got to the church and I went to the prayer room, and I went down to my face personally, and I reminded the Lord, the hour is getting short.
30:46 -  Just in case, maybe I was most of the time. I said, Lord, out there are hundreds of expected people, and I myself did not know the distance that some of them had traveled that night to be at that service.
31:01 -  Fifty, seventy-five, a hundred miles, one way, to hear the Word of God. I was the one who needed you. With your God, we had fewer meetings than when we had them.
31:14 -  We had the opportunity of hearing our hearts. With your God, we got off the monotonous nonsense of having to fill monthly obligations, having to reach at the bottom of the barrel to find a speaker.
31:26 -  I was really exalted for the oil crisis. At least it had this advantage. We wouldn't so lavishly be able to have conferences and convocations, and all kinds of things in full gospel, group line, all that kind of stuff,
31:38 -  that meant we traveled lavishly to reach. We haven't had fewer, but more solemn or spiritually planned times of the assembly of God's people to hear from God himself.
31:53 -  Has there ever been a generation that has heard more and shown less benefit from the hearing of the wooden? You may not have seen tape libraries in the homes of ordinary believers
32:03 -  that would blow your mind. They could go into business, but they don't have a corresponding maturing. I somehow still have a hankering for good old Abe Winger,
32:15 -  who grew up with only four or five books through his entire youth in early Man Utd. What I'll tell you wasn't a piece of punctuation in any of those books that escaped his attention. He sucked the very marrow from the bones.
32:34 -  Well, I prayed earnestly on my face in that prayer room, and God said, I'm going to have peace. And so I came to the meeting, and I had already begun,
32:45 -  and I took a seat in the front queue there, and the clock was ticking away, and I was getting closer and closer to being introduced,
32:52 -  and yet the Lord had not spoken. What would you have done in such a situation? I began at Genesis, and I read through all the books,
32:59 -  the only book of Revelation, and only that one book, I loomed large on that page, nothing. And so finally I was full, and what could I do?
33:09 -  Just like tonight. And I came and I brought my body by the microphone, and I looked up, and I see the expectant faces.
33:17 -  Wow! I knew there were microphones and tape recorders just around the room, people poised, waiting to catch every syllable that went over my lips.
33:26 -  And I had, and I had, I had one more opportunity to pray. Do you want to hear a man bellow before God?
33:36 -  Seriously, there's nowhere. I said, Lord, the hour has come. Your people are assembled, your messenger is here.
33:46 -  We're all expectant and waiting with a crossroad. The hour is urgent, life and death, space. What is your will?
33:58 -  When I lifted my head, I had nothing. What would you have done then? You know what happened at that moment?
34:07 -  About ten things crossed through my mind. I thought of juicy messages given of God, every one that have had people sprawled out of their seats
34:15 -  and holding platforms in their pockets, gasping and sucking for air. That's how annoying they were.
34:22 -  And yet I knew that I could not speak one of them. Unless God and Norbert showed it, unless it's fresh from the throne,
34:31 -  out of the heart of God, not at all. Forget it. But what's the alternative to not speaking?
34:37 -  The most agonizing and embarrassing and humiliating silence that you could imagine. You know what I finally had to say to these people
34:46 -  who were waiting and looking at me with quizzical expressions? I looked up and then I said, I have nothing to speak.
34:55 -  Give me a mob of outwit rabbis any day. And the faces of God's expected and disappointed people. If looks could kill.
35:09 -  You know what they look said? Hey, we thought that you were an anointed messenger. What do you mean you have nothing?
35:17 -  Don't you prepare? Have you ever heard praying? Don't you have a concordance?
35:21 -  What do you mean you have nothing? I could not answer them a word in the morning. God hadn't explained to me.
35:32 -  I said, I don't know what to say to you people. All I know is that I can't say anything, but let's wait until it's over.
35:39 -  Have we seen a mob? Let us wait upon the Lord of the aliens. Great song, isn't it?
35:45 -  How do you like to do it? Before hundreds. We're just giving you the eye.
35:54 -  Tick, tock, tick, tock. You move from one foot to another, you change your position,
36:01 -  you look down, you look sideways, you look up. I'll tell you that the tension was so thick in that room,
36:06 -  it could be cut all night. And finally, what it seemed utterly unbearable to the point of bursting.
36:14 -  Someone had got up tremblingly from his seat. I learned later. He had met me before I publicly spoke in a congregation.
36:20 -  And he said with a voice like a leaf, you know what it is? He said, I have a scripture.
36:25 -  Could this be it? It's red, it's carpeted, it's old. I'm telling you, it was a scripture.
36:35 -  Mamma Mia! It was in a scripture. It was juicy.
36:39 -  It was not of Olympians. It had to do with suffering. I may not be a fool not to be able to spin a message off
36:45 -  with that scripture standing on his head upside down. Know what I had to say to him? I'm sorry, brother.
36:51 -  That's not fair. Did you ever watch a man who died publicly? Did you ever watch a man publicly humiliated
36:59 -  who had taken his life in his hands, believing that he had been moved by the Holy Spirit only to hear that he had missed it?
37:08 -  That guy fell not through his seat but through the floor. And then we waited. And waited.
37:15 -  And waited. And waited. And waited.
37:18 -  And waited. And waited. And waited.
37:21 -  And waited. And waited. Children, do you know what suffering is?
37:26 -  Do you know what the cross is? Do you know what the cry of the thrones is? Or did you think it was going to come to some heroic place?
37:34 -  Some Yugoslavian dungeon or something like that where they pull your fingernails or they go through the electric shocks and testicles
37:40 -  or something like that? Not the way to get the news long enough. There's a school right now for the true priesthood
37:47 -  for as many who have a stomach to receive it. I'll tell you the same breath. There are far more numerical schools
37:55 -  that are a lot groupier. If you've got the money and the time, it only takes three months.
38:01 -  And you'll be fashion prepared and sent to water. All this friction. And you know, I'm not buying.
38:07 -  Isn't that the American way? Instant, this, that, you know, convenience, packages. I think one of the greatest good things
38:19 -  that the Lord has ever done is to move me to a remote wilderness. Imagine a guy who grew up in New York and Brooklyn and got us meat that supermodest, privilege, packaged, and self-made
38:29 -  had to see for the first time an animal butchered. Wow. Did you ever see blood?
38:40 -  We had to barbecue a lamb and a pig to feed a convocation. And I had never witnessed the death of an animal.
38:49 -  It was about time. Because I'm always proud that there's no life without death. I hardly understood what that meant until that day.
38:59 -  Well, the lamb wasn't too bad. Just a few jerks and tremors. My stomach got a little queasy, but I can survive this.
39:06 -  But then came the pig. You've never seen one. It took four able-bodied men to keep that piece of protoplasm on the ground.
39:17 -  I'll tell you from my Jewish point of view, a pig is minimal protoplasm. Free refrigeration age was God's ingenuity
39:31 -  to package that protoplasm with minimal brain and any other endearing thing. But that little slit of life, encased in skin,
39:43 -  put up such a holler and a shriek and a commotion that it made your hair stand straight up. I never heard it squeals and grunts and shrieks,
39:51 -  and so three things come out of that howling animal as I heard about that thing. It chirped, it fought, it struggled
39:58 -  just to keep this filthy protoplasmic life. When they had that sucker down, this rural character who was performing the butchery
40:10 -  turned, and wouldn't you believe it, he hints at it already. I'm the guy who wanted to be a ballet dancer. That's not my function, the body of Christ.
40:25 -  And I'll tell you what children, as we're going to see shortly, true priesthood wallows in pleasure. And if you're too squinted, look at it.
40:37 -  You know when God consecrated the priests? It was the day that Moses came down from the Mount with a fattened soul, and he said,
40:47 -  It was the day that Moses came down from the Mount with the tablets of the Lord, and saw an Israel whoring and exulting around a golden tent,
40:55 -  eating and drinking and rising from the lake. They threw the tablets down, and they cried out to that people,
41:03 -  Who is on the Lord's side? Why do I learn to hear that crying again? Who is on the Lord's side?
41:12 -  In a certain segment of the Jewish people, very peculiar, Levi's came and stood by the side of Moses. Isn't that what we like to love to make these altar calls
41:22 -  and these responses? But how many of us would make them if we knew what was going to come next?
41:27 -  Okay, now, put on this sword, everyone of you, and go in and out of the camp, and slay every man, his neighbor, his brother, his friend.
41:38 -  That's bloody children. That's painful. That's putting God before man.
41:44 -  You know what's about that? This day had been consecrated as priests. It began in blood, it continues in blood,
41:54 -  and it shall end in blood. And there's something so stubborn in us that seeks some grooving alternative
42:00 -  to the true mysteries of God. That's what I saw in that mystery that day. Speaking correct things, but I'm willing to draw blood.
42:09 -  He cut out on God, and therefore also on man. That's why the world is dying. That's why our faith is a mock
42:19 -  and our religion a travesty. That's why the cities are not shaking and taking for Christ.
42:26 -  Because we don't want to draw blood. Well, this guy, when I heard him strengthen the knife, he took it, and he plunged it in.
42:34 -  And I heard that animal emit such sounds as I can't describe. And they hoisted that piece of protoplasm
42:41 -  up by its hind legs. And I'll tell you, until virtually the last drop of blood poured out of that piece of flesh,
42:47 -  it continued to shriek and howl to the expiration of the last drop of blood. Finally, when it was dead,
42:55 -  he took the knife and slashed it down the middle and took out what we Jews call the kishkes, what we Jews call the kishkes, the guts.
43:05 -  And when he came to the heart, as nobody showed him, he said, but God, that heart was punctured
43:10 -  when I put the knife in right from the beginning. And yet that thing continued to shriek and howl virtually to the last drop of blood.
43:18 -  I have never forgotten that experience. A pig dies hard. Moses took anointing oil in the tenth verse
43:28 -  and anointed it with tapenac when all that was in it and consecrated it. And I'll tell you, children,
43:33 -  if dumb pieces of furniture, pieces of metal and wood, be anointed, what shall we say
43:39 -  who have made this ash and called it his kishke? And he sprinkled some of the oil
43:45 -  on the anointed seven times. All that was in it, your taxes, the laborer's face,
43:50 -  to consecrate them. And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head
43:53 -  and he anointed it and consecrated it. And then he brought Aaron's sons and put anointing on them
43:58 -  and grew them with stashes and treasures as the Lord commanded Moses. Then he brought the bowl of the sin offering
44:03 -  and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bowl of the sin offering.
44:06 -  Moses killed it and took the blood and put it on the horns of the altar
44:09 -  round the bottom of his finger, poured the blood at the base of the altar, purified and consecrated the altar
44:13 -  to make atonement for his. They took all the fat that was on the entrails
44:17 -  and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys would get fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.
44:22 -  But the bowl, the sin offering, as high as flesh and stone, he burned it with fire outside the camp
44:27 -  as the Lord commanded Moses. We're only at the beginning. Are you getting a little school?
44:33 -  And I'll tell you by the time I finish with the bowl and with the goat and with the lamb
44:37 -  and the animals that are required, we shall be standing virtually in a puddle of blood.
44:43 -  I don't understand this and I'm just, I don't know, just musing that what we would consider
44:49 -  to be the value of the animals is high than is flesh. I suppose from an agricultural point of view
44:56 -  it's done, that was taken out and burned and destroyed. And that which we would consider
45:01 -  of no value, the entrails, the liver, the lobe, the fat, that was given on the altar
45:07 -  as a sacrifice. I'm telling you children, God's way is not our way, nor his way.
45:14 -  The ministry that seems to us glowing, that seems to us elegant, that seems to us so rich, exciting,
45:21 -  but we got thrilled, we were lifted up out of our seats. Maybe that's the kind of thing
45:25 -  that dissipates just as quickly as it is born. But the kind of thing that makes us turn and grimace,
45:31 -  that leaves us unhappy with the speaker, that makes us meet him at the door and say thank you for your nice sermon
45:36 -  when we're barely looking in the face to gain his guts for that speaking. The entrails, the lobe, the liver, the fat,
45:43 -  the unsavory, the undelectable parts, maybe that's the kind of the God side is the source of atonement
45:50 -  and save of that device. And so we put a ram to the burnt altar in the 18th verse,
45:56 -  and again they lay hands on it, Moses killed it, dashed the blood upon the altar on the rock,
46:00 -  cut the ram into pieces, burned the head into pieces, the fat,
46:03 -  washed the entrails, the legs in the water, burnt the whole ram into the altar.
46:06 -  It was a burnt sacrifice for smooth and satisfying fragrance, an offering made by a prayer to the Lord
46:10 -  as the Lord committed Moses. I wish you would take your pen tonight and just every time you put this phrase on the wall,
46:15 -  as the Lord committed Moses, as the Lord committed Moses, as the Lord committed Moses.
46:20 -  And you'll see that every command has got to do with something that flat out patently contradicts
46:26 -  all human sensibility. Nothing to do with things that we reckon to be wise or estimable
46:33 -  or delightful, unsavory, unpleasant, offensive, as the Lord committed Moses.
46:40 -  And I'll tell you children, if you have no stutter, to do the things that the Lord shall command you
46:45 -  that are unsavory and do not give you a delight. You may be some kind of a religious hacker
46:52 -  and a functionary in a time circle, but you shall not be a priest or a God. You say, what happened that night?
47:01 -  Well, I'll tell you what happened after an unbearable week. When again it seemed that we were going to
47:06 -  burst from the very tension, a woman got up on the other side of the room and again with great confidence said,
47:11 -  Brother Cassius, did I have a scripture? Could this be it? And we had all Halloween party at last.
47:16 -  We rejected one because it was not the real thing. Now, this must be the real thing. And we waited and we heard the scripture.
47:22 -  It was a lullaby. But did y'all have a telephone? Sorry, that's not the word.
47:28 -  And she had to receive like a month. And we waited and waited and waited. And finally in that excruciating last moment,
47:38 -  it must have been like the fourth day that Lazarus languished in the grave waiting to hear the voice of his beloved Jesus
47:44 -  calling him forth. We had broke forth somewhere and missed that congregation
47:48 -  and others in the heights. Out of some other portion of the auditorium came an interpretation.
47:54 -  Something began to move in my spirit and God began to give us something that was not just good,
48:00 -  but that was perfect. You know, I've been back to that place when they said,
48:04 -  that was an historic night in the life of our congregation. God told them that their passing day was over
48:14 -  and it's no more going to be a question of sitting in rows looking at the back of a listhead watching the professional group.
48:22 -  They would come to an earnest hour in which we're all involved in the bringing forth of the mysteries of God
48:28 -  and we're all a priest of God today. Ministries were born that night. They entered into a depth of relationship
48:36 -  with God and each other which continues to this day. And it began in painful, excruciating waiting
48:42 -  which was like dying. It was bloody children. Bloody, bloody, bloody.
48:48 -  Now, are you able to receive this? Looking back in retrospect, you know what I would say?
48:55 -  That both scriptures that came from the men and from the women were actually inspired of God to be spoken
49:03 -  but not to be acted upon. Can you believe that? Can you believe that God would go so far
49:12 -  as to humiliate a man and a woman to move them by the spirit to speak the scripture and yet to test the quality of our readings
49:19 -  not to act upon them? I'll tell you if you'll not believe it. You shall be wholly unfit
49:26 -  to move with an unbossed boxed God in the unconventional dealings that are going to come from this end
49:33 -  right through to the end of the age. We've been spoiled by those little cassis
49:39 -  painted by the number of sins. You don't have to be an artist without that talent.
49:44 -  Fourteen is red and thirteen is blue and twelve is something else and you put it all together
49:48 -  you've got the Lord's supper. And we've brought that same mentality to the people of God.
49:57 -  I'll tell you children, true ministry is expansive. It's costly.
50:03 -  It's lavish. It's extravagant. It's wasteful.
50:06 -  It's bloody. And it does not flatter the flesh. You want to be a priest?
50:12 -  I'll tell you that at the end of your service when you have faithfully performed
50:17 -  all that the Lord has commanded you're going to be an unsavory bloody mess and a spectacle before them.
50:27 -  Standing in pools of blood with the gore and the flesh in your fingernails
50:32 -  and dripping water all over us. That's what is required in the true service of the Lord.
50:39 -  They had to waive this meat offering. Imagine the foolishness of that? Waiving.
50:44 -  Everything that's humiliated and not painted with flesh. And then they were told in the 31st verse
50:49 -  that Moses said to Aaron and his sons boil the flesh at the door of the temple meeting and dare eat it with the dreadness
50:54 -  and the vaster consecration of ordination. As I commanded saying Aaron and his sons shall eat it
50:59 -  and what remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in fire. And let me tell you this children
51:05 -  if you're not prepared to eat what you yourself sacrifice you don't understand what being a priest
51:12 -  under God means. You're going to have to eat your ministry. And I'll tell you sometimes
51:20 -  it's not too pleasant going down. I've got a whole irresponsibility before God tonight.
51:26 -  Not that this is mine or his will. I'll tell you if I miss it there's going to be such an indigestible lung
51:32 -  in my gut. If I so tonight could placate you and to please you and to be cute
51:37 -  and out of delight and isn't it wonderful when Jewish brother gave his testimony
51:42 -  how do I get out of this middle west? I would have to eat that children. I would have to eat my ministry.
51:48 -  It lives with me and becomes part of me also. I'll tell you that the relationship that has been established with that church
51:55 -  that passes that congregation shall not do it. I've got to invest into my life
52:00 -  what God transacted out of my sweat and all the crises and fears and trumpets that night and through those days.
52:06 -  And that other place where I told you where God was carrying on maniacally and the pastor said in 30 years of ministry
52:12 -  I've never had such a secret. What are you trying to do? Destroy the church?
52:16 -  I have to eat that. And if that was just our cats if that was just Jewish contentiousness
52:22 -  I'm going to eat that. But I'll tell you what happened on the last day. The same man whose wife
52:28 -  sat in that court seat and glowered at me service after service with such unspeakable anger
52:34 -  as you could not imagine pouring out of the face of a white minister. She hated my guts
52:40 -  for the things that I was speaking. But on the last day of the last service
52:46 -  the man who was not even able to bring himself to introduce me and called me cats
52:52 -  because he could not even bring himself to call me by my first name had someone else introduce me at the services.
52:58 -  And that day got up and he introduced me. And he said people, he said, I've been a pastor
53:04 -  for 30 years. I've had all kinds of secrets. The biggest and the best.
53:10 -  The most famous, well-known, popular. But I've never had such a business. I've never been more personally attacked
53:16 -  more devastated more undone more left for dead
53:22 -  more humiliated. My own children have refused to come back to the service. They've been arguing with me to dismiss this man
53:28 -  and not allow him to go on. And yet I felt constrained to God to do so. I've never been more broken.
53:36 -  I've never received great revelation. I've never had my understanding more addressed.
53:42 -  I've never been more lifted out of myself. I've never seen a greater exaltation of the glory of God.
53:48 -  I've never more fully grasped the understanding of his purpose. For every negative thing he said he had such a
53:54 -  towards positive expression. Because at the end of it all it was all finished.
54:00 -  All of the blood, all of the streets, all of the flesh flying, all of the blood stains, all of the river slopes.
54:06 -  God brought forth his glory. There weren't just beatings children. It was an event
54:12 -  in the life of the people and the man who shall never again be the same. The people who were ready to
54:18 -  listen to the first would not let me go at the last. Clutching my glory. Can't you stay another day?
54:24 -  I said to the pastor, where's your microphone? I've seen it all day. Artie said, I'll never
54:30 -  find the words to thank you. God has so devastatingly dealt with my life.
54:36 -  He has reached down so deep and broken something at the fount of her life that had to do with
54:42 -  compacted resentments and fears that go back to her childhood. That which she just came upon,
54:48 -  she's dissolved in tears, she can't take it anymore, and she has just mumbled to me, please thank you.
54:54 -  Are you willing to be appreciated? God shall not explain to you what you're
55:00 -  doing and you'll not be able to explain to other men. You'll suffer reproaches and shrieks and cat
55:06 -  calls and screams. When the blood shall fly in the blood and flesh that at the end you might see the glory
55:12 -  of God. Oh, it's not a groovy school and you're not always so pleasantly
55:18 -  appreciated, but God is looking for a priest for this generation.
55:24 -  You don't think it's strange where this chapter ends? You shall not go out of the door of the tent at the meeting
55:30 -  for seven days until the days of your consecration and ordination are ended. Lord, it will take seven days to
55:36 -  consecrate and obey. As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do for your atonement.
55:42 -  At the door of the tent at the meeting you shall remain day and night for seven days doing what the Lord has charged you to do
55:48 -  that you dine out for so I am commanded. For air and the sun did all the things which the Lord
55:54 -  commanded by Moses. Are you willing to wait until the perfect
56:00 -  number is complete? Are you willing to wait for the true call before the God in this place? Will you not initiate
56:06 -  activities and newsrooms that you're on? Will you not go running helter skelter to and fro on things which you think are good
56:12 -  and what you perform? Will you wait? Will you wait? Will you wait? You have a stomach for obscurity and
56:18 -  hiddenness and quietness and be unseen until it is time for the performance of
56:24 -  the newsroom. Because the beautiful thing is it shall come in the eighth day. And as we turn to the ninth chapter
56:30 -  it says on the eighth day, Moses called air and the sun and the elders of Israel and he said they are going to take a young calf
56:36 -  for a sin offering and a ram for a bread offering without blemish and only coming before the Lord and say to the Israelites, take a male
56:42 -  for a sin offering, a calf, a lamb with a earl with a blinch for a birth offering a bull a ram for a feast offering
56:48 -  a sacrificial for the Lord and a cereal offering mixed with oil, for today the Lord will appear
56:54 -  to you. Have you ever experienced an appearance of the Lord?
57:00 -  Have you ever tasted the glory of God? Have you ever been
57:06 -  in a place at a time and an event which is holy and has its origin in heaven and is performed
57:12 -  by his spirit for his glory and for his kingdom alone? I'll tell you once you shall
57:18 -  be forever spoiled for any lesser thing. This day
57:24 -  the Lord shall appear to you. And I speak this children of the broken heart not because I
57:30 -  covet to see the glory of God that I should be exalted, but for this reason that every time
57:36 -  that the glory of God has come upon the earth, apostate, backslidden, stubborn,
57:42 -  selfish, vain men have fallen on their faces and cried out, the Lord he is
57:48 -  God, the Lord he is God. And I don't know anything less that will produce
57:54 -  that. It only takes one day but it is the day
58:00 -  of the Lord's using his time, his place, his way. It's the eighth day.
58:06 -  It's the resurrection number. It's the new thing. It will wait seven days perfectly.
58:12 -  The Lord will appear to you this day. And on that day it's going to be as bloody as the previous
58:18 -  days. A careful lamb ram, cut it, hack it, bleed it. Mix it with cereal with oil.
58:24 -  A cereal offering mixed with oil for the day the Lord will appear to you. Not that little oil of personality.
58:30 -  Not that squealing voice that is cheap and fetching that we think we need to do to make our messages in hearing.
58:36 -  Not that oil. A pox of that oil is the holy oil
58:42 -  it's the anointing oil that doesn't have to be fabricated and promoted to make ourselves in hearing through our
58:48 -  own business. It's mixed with brand that feeds and sustains and floods
58:54 -  that the glory of God is to appear there. Nothing has changed can you see it?
59:00 -  Only we. Cheap and quick, prolific, tasty, easy. Let's have it.
59:06 -  Struggling in power, plugging it in the water. Let's have it. Let's go. Let's do it. But we're not seeing the Lord appear.
59:12 -  This is the thing which the Lord commanded you to do and the glory of the Lord will appear to you. Amen.
59:18 -  So Moses said to Aaron, join in the altar and offer your sin offering, your bread offering, and make atonement
59:24 -  for yourself the people offered. The offering of the people make atonement for them as the Lord commanded it. So Aaron drew near the altar and killed the calf
59:30 -  with the sin offering which was designated for himself. And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on
59:36 -  the bones of the altar and poured out the blood on the altar's base. But the fat, the kidneys, the lobe of liver, the sin offering he burned on the
59:42 -  altar as the Lord commanded Moses. And the flesh to hide Aaron burned the fire outside the kingdom. He killed the burnt offering, Aaron's sons
59:48 -  delivered him with blood which he dashed around about the altar. And they brought the burnt offering to him piece by piece. The head and Aaron
59:54 -  burned it with the altar, washed the entrails of the legs, he burned them with the burnt offering on the altar. And Aaron presented the people's offering to the sin offering
01:00:00 -  which was the people who killed it, he offered it for sins as he did the first offering. He presented the burnt offering and he offered it according to the ordinance.
01:00:06 -  And Aaron presented the serial offering, took the handful and burned it on the altar. He also killed the bull in the ram to sacrifice the peace offerings
01:00:12 -  to the people. And Aaron's sons presented him with blood which he dashed upon the altar round about. And the fat of the bull in the ram, the fat tail that was
01:00:18 -  covered in the entrails of the kidneys, the lobe of the liver, they put the fat upon the breast and Aaron burned the fat upon the altar. But the breast and the right
01:00:24 -  by Aaron way for way opened before the Lord as most committed. Hey, what are we reading here?
01:00:30 -  Is this holy writ and scripture? Or is this a kind of formula
01:00:36 -  for becoming a butcher? Isn't priesthood some dainty thing? Sanctify
01:00:42 -  holy, man and perfect, they blundered the sermons, speaking with unctuous and flattering poems, and sonorous
01:00:48 -  saints and stained-glass lingos and wailing dissents, and all that religious abracadabra which the world lost.
01:00:54 -  But of this priesthood, service unto the Lord,
01:01:00 -  they know nothing. It's bloody, it's unflattering, it's vulgar, it's obscene.
01:01:06 -  And when you're finished in your obedience to the Lord, you're standing in blood up to your ankles.
01:01:14 -  Then in the 22nd verse, Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them.
01:01:20 -  Not people, but them. This little abracadabra, in the name of Jesus, rubbing the genie in the land, hoping to see them come out
01:01:26 -  and do the magical thing. And maybe if our voice gets louder, God will show me how to make a profit.
01:01:32 -  What kitty games are we playing? Who do we think we're kidding? Then
01:01:38 -  Aaron lifted his hands and blessed them. There's no blessing before
01:01:44 -  this bloody sacrifice is put into. He blessed them and came down from the altar
01:01:50 -  and offering the still life to the brain-working priest of him. And I'll tell you for sure that his hands were stretched out
01:01:56 -  and priestly blessing over the heads of his people. You never saw a filthy pair of
01:02:02 -  hands in your life, dripping with blood and blood down to the ankles.
01:02:08 -  Still one vehicles, still one assailant. I looked up the word
01:02:14 -  consecration, no dreams, hands full. And guess what?
01:02:20 -  The blood of sacrifice. Then Aaron
01:02:26 -  blessed the people. And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and when they came out they blessed the people
01:02:32 -  and the glory of the Lord, the Shekinah cloud appeared to all the people as rocks
01:02:38 -  because they did all that the Lord had given them. Then
01:02:44 -  there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed the burning offering of the family altar and when all the people saw it
01:02:50 -  they showered and fell on their faces. Hallelujah. I'll tell you children that service that begins
01:02:56 -  is unto the laws is in the last analysis the purest, deepest, best
01:03:02 -  service from them. And the people saw it and they fell on their faces.
01:03:08 -  Because they did that which the Lord had given them. And there is not a shred of it that has any
01:03:14 -  man-flattering appeal in itself. I can't close the book without saying that I have
01:03:22 -  the greatest sense of trembling for deceptions
01:03:28 -  that are soon coming from the earth upon God's people. Right now I am already concerned
01:03:34 -  for a dear brother in ministry who is already departed for the things which
01:03:40 -  the Lord had given him. And the Lord opened this whole section of scripture and the issue
01:03:46 -  that has come up with a brother who might believe this movement into dangerous deception.
01:03:52 -  They don't want his marriages. He wants to do for the Lord and of course also for himself.
01:03:58 -  After all he's got a newsletter that goes out every month and you've got to put something in there, you've got to give some report you've got to tell your constituency
01:04:04 -  what they're doing if you expect their response. There's a certain inordinate necessity
01:04:10 -  to do, to perform, to sing to the earth, to cry it out to underline, to help defend, to give
01:04:16 -  four-color print shots, to initiate things which God has meant for us.
01:04:22 -  Of course it's all in his name. The tenth chapter, I'll just read the report
01:04:28 -  at the beginning of the original ends. The name of God had been habituated to the sons of Aaron. Each book is censored, put
01:04:34 -  fire in it, put incense on it, and all the strange and unholy marketing for the Lord as he had not.
01:04:42 -  And they came forth there before the Lord, fire and killed them, and they died
01:04:48 -  before the Lord. And Moses said to Aaron, this is what the Lord meant when he said,
01:04:54 -  I and my will, not their own will be acknowledged as hallowed by those who come near me, and before
01:05:00 -  all people I will be honored. And Aaron said, Two men, priests,
01:05:06 -  were consumed by God and killed on the spot. They were priests, they were Levites,
01:05:12 -  they were sons of Aaron, and they were ordained to carry incense. But they did it at a time
01:05:18 -  when the Lord had not committed them. You say, is it that important? Yes.
01:05:26 -  But why did they do it? Because they just saw the glory of God fall,
01:05:32 -  and they had an itch to produce it themselves. Children,
01:05:40 -  where is the priest who can help for our generation? Who will do
01:05:46 -  all that the Lord has commanded, nothing more than this?
01:05:52 -  Men and women willing to wait at the door of his house until the eighth day
01:05:58 -  the coming forth of the perfect call of God for his ministry, that day the Lord will appear.
01:06:06 -  Lord, you have a stomach for this. It's not flattering, it's not pleasing, it's not quick, it's not
01:06:12 -  easy. It lends itself to being the son of a scape. It makes you look
01:06:18 -  slaughterly unkempt. But it's the formula for the coming
01:06:24 -  forth of God's glory in a world which is dying for it. We're produced in pagans
01:06:30 -  and our own children. My claim creeps sitting in backs of pews,
01:06:36 -  in backs of churches, digging each other with their elbows, cracking jokes, waiting to get out of that
01:06:42 -  ceremonial paganism while some man down below is batting his guns saying correct things.
01:06:48 -  But his spirit contributes to speaking because he doesn't want to offend men. And he's
01:06:54 -  placating men rather than serving God because he has no stomach for it.
01:07:00 -  Who are the priests of the brotherhood of our generation who will wait on the Lord
01:07:06 -  and serve him and do service unto the Lord that his glory can appear again on Earth
01:07:12 -  that men will rip off their choker beads and their black clothes and all of their worldly abundance
01:07:18 -  fall on their faces before God and cry out again Lord is gone.
01:07:24 -  It's not going to be done by men and their families and door knockers and literature distribution
01:07:30 -  nor the other cheap substitutes that will save us from the alternative of
01:07:36 -  blood and sacrifice. Who are the priests of the brotherhood of our generation
01:07:42 -  who will wait on the Lord and serve him and do service unto the Lord that his glory can appear again on Earth
01:07:48 -  that men will rip off their choker beads and all of their worldly abundance fall on their faces before God and cry out again on Earth Men who would rather die Men who would rather die
01:07:54 -  than speak out of their own heads or even use messages which find themselves as preponderable
01:08:00 -  Men who will rip and slash and speak the truth without compromise or equivocation
01:08:06 -  if that's where it pleases God to be hired Priests
01:08:12 -  will serve us as unto the Lord and hired Precious Holy God
01:08:18 -  Precious Holy God Mighty God, may your glory appear again on Earth
01:08:24 -  in direct proportion Lord, to the obedience of whom this is
01:08:30 -  to do only that which you have to do I ask the Precious God
01:08:36 -  to look upon these children this night before him that is pleased to speak these ungainly
01:08:42 -  and precious young people whose hearts palpitate to serve God
01:08:48 -  and Lord I have spoken a sobering word to give us yet
01:08:54 -  another perspective and in your name and their giving in yours
01:09:00 -  I would ask for those who want to be enrolled in this school
01:09:06 -  those who have a stomach to eat who are willing to endure the blood and the burrow
01:09:12 -  the misunderstandings and the reproach the shrieks and the howls
01:09:18 -  the disappointment of men that you might be policing to collect a prudent obedience
01:09:24 -  will you stand before God now?
